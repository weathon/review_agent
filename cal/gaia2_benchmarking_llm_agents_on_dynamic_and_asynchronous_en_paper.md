ABSTRACT


We introduce **Gaia2**, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in
realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of
agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to
noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents.
Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, actionlevel evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source
models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches
the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks,
Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among opensource models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs
between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the
“sim2real” gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source
**Agents Research Environments** platform and designed to be easy to extend. By
releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide
the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and
training the next generation of practical agent systems.

1 INTRODUCTION


Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising path for improving large language model (LLM) agents at scale in domains such as reasoning, coding, and tooluse, offering a more reliable alternative to preference-based methods (OpenAI, 2024b; DeepSeek-AI
et al., 2025; Mistral-AI et al., 2025; MoonshotAI et al., 2025). At the same time, the use-cases of
modern agents increasingly involve sustained long-horizon interaction with dynamic environments,
where time, uncertainty, and collaboration play a central role. This has motivated the creation of
LLM agent benchmarks (Mialon et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024; Backlund &
Petersson, 2025), yet most such benchmarks are static or synchronous: environments only change
when the agents act, and evaluation typically ignores intermediate steps or actions. As a result, many
of the challenges agents face in real deployments—such as handling asynchronous events, operating
under temporal constraints, or adapting to noise and uncertainty—remain untested.


We introduce **Gaia2**, a benchmark designed to address these limitations by evaluating agents in
asynchronous environments with verifiable tasks that, like GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), are simple for
humans but challenging for today’s AI models. Gaia2 scenarios are motivated by real deployed use
cases: it generalizes information seeking to environments instead of web-only, Gaia2-Time reflects
the requirements of scheduled task products (e.g., calendar and reminders), and Gaia2-Agent2Agent
mirrors the recently proposed Agent2Agent protocol for interoperable multi-agent systems (Google
Developers, 2025). Gaia2 consists of 1,120 human-annotated scenarios set in a smartphone-like
environment with realistic apps (email, messaging, calendar, contacts, etc.), similar to AppWorld
and ToolSandbox (Trivedi et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). Each scenario requires capabilities beyond search and execution, including adaptability to new events, robustness to noise, resolution of
ambiguity, temporal awareness, and collaboration with other agents. To enable reproducible and
fine-grained evaluation, Gaia2 introduces a write action verifier that checks every state-changing
action against oracle annotations, making the benchmark directly applicable to RLVR. Built on the
**Agents** **Research** **Environments** (ARE) platform, Gaia2 provides abstractions for creating asynchronous environments and supports continuous extension of benchmarks. The core concepts of
ARE, illustrated in Figure 2, allow generalization beyond Gaia2 to the definition of other benchmarks. In practice, this design reveals new failure modes: while frontier models achieve overall
success rates around 42%, no system dominates across all capabilities, with strong reasoning often
traded off against speed, robustness, or cost.


**Contributions** This paper makes three main contributions to advance the evaluation of LLM
agents and to chart open directions for the next generation of practical systems:


 - **ARE** **framework:** We release _Agents_ _Research_ _Environments_, a general-purpose platform for
building asynchronous, event-driven benchmarks that support scalable evaluation and data generation for RL.

 - **Gaia2 benchmark:** We introduce _Gaia2_, the first benchmark unifying asynchronous execution,
temporal reasoning, noise robustness, ambiguity resolution, and multi-agent collaboration under
a verifiable evaluation framework directly usable for RLVR.

 - **Empirical study:** We evaluate leading proprietary and open-source models on Gaia2, exposing
fundamental trade-offs between reasoning strength, efficiency, robustness, and cost.


2 RELATED WORK


**Benchmarking LLM agents** A wide range of benchmarks have been proposed to measure agent
capabilities. Embodied and web-based environments such as ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021),
WebShop (Yao et al., 2023a), WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024), and WorkArena (Drouin et al., 2024)
emphasize grounded execution. Synthetic environments such as AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024)
and ToolSandbox (Lu et al., 2025) introduce app-like tasks with state verification or milestonebased evaluation, while BFCL (Patil et al., 2025) targets large-scale function calling. Other efforts
incorporate temporal dynamics and multi-agent interaction, including VendingBench (Backlund &
Petersson, 2025), _τ_ -Bench and _τ_ [2] -Bench (Yao et al., 2024; Barres et al., 2025), MultiAgentBench
(Zhu et al., 2025), and MCP-based benchmarks (Wang et al., 2025; Team, 2025; Gao et al., 2025;
Anthropic, 2024). Finally, static setups such as GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), SWE-bench (Jimenez

Figure 2: ARE environments are event-based, time-driven simulations, that run asynchronously
from the agent and the user. ARE environments allows playing scenarios, which typically contain
tasks for the agent and verification logic. Whether initiated by agent or user, interactions happen
through the same interfaces and can be either tool calls, or tool output/notification observations.
Extensive simulation control and logging allow precise study of agents behavior.


et al., 2024), and BrowseComp (Wei et al., 2025) evaluate only final outcomes. While these benchmarks each capture valuable aspects of agent reasoning, tool use, or collaboration, they remain
_synchronous and agent-driven_ : environments only change when the agent acts, and evaluation typically ignores intermediate steps or actions. Gaia2 differs by introducing asynchronous, event-driven
environments that stress temporal constraints, robustness, ambiguity resolution, and multi-agent coordination under a unified, verifiable evaluation.


**Verification in agentic benchmarks** Verification strategies vary across benchmarks. GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023) evaluates correctness at the final output level via exact match. This suits searchstyle tasks but lacks flexibility in format and content, especially in web-based, evolving domains.
ToolSandbox (Lu et al., 2025) introduces _milestones_ and _minefields_ that constrain the agent’s trajectory, enabling early checks of both outcomes and intermediate behavior. Beyond strictly verifiable
domains, the _Rubrics_ _as_ _Rewards_ framework (Gunjal et al., 2025; Starace et al., 2025; Lin et al.,
2025) shows how checklist-style rubrics can serve as interpretable reward signals for subjective
tasks, highlighting the broader potential of rubric-based evaluation. Gaia2 extends this with the _ARE_
_Verifier_, which evaluates every state-changing write action against oracle annotations. It combines
exact argument checks, rubric-guided judgments for flexible cases, and causal and temporal constraints. Importantly, the verifier is a standalone contribution: a general mechanism for fine-grained,
reproducible credit assignment reusable beyond Gaia2. While today’s models underperform, we
expect future RLVR-trained systems to close the gap and eventually solve Gaia2.


3 ARE: SCALING UP AGENT ENVIRONMENTS AND EVALUATIONS


ARE is a research platform for creating simulated environments,
running agents in them, and analyzing their behavior. ARE environments evolve continuously and are decoupled from the agent.
Time advances in the simulation as the environment introduces
events. Agents run asynchronously and interact with the user and
environment through dedicated interfaces.

_cations_ provide a configurable observability layer: a policy selects which events are pushed to the
agent’s context, enabling the study of proactive and reactive behavior under varying observability;
and (v) _scenarios_ extend static tasks into dynamic trajectories by specifying an initial state and a
DAG of events, including the user’s request, intermediate events, and a verification method. Verification can run offline at the end of the run or online via scheduled validation events, and focuses on
write operations to avoid over-constraining exploration strategies. To demonstrate the generality of
these abstractions, we validated that ARE can faithfully reimplement existing agentic benchmarks
such as _τ_ -bench, _τ_ [2] -bench GAIA, and BFCL-v3, VendingBench(Yao et al., 2024; Barres et al., 2025;
Mialon et al., 2023; Patil et al., 2025; Backlund & Petersson, 2025), confirming that the platform
both subsumes current benchmarks and provides a foundation for the next generation of agentic
evaluations. More details about ARE concepts are provided in Appendix A.1.


**Asynchronicity and time** Because environments run asynchronously, model generations directly
consume simulated time: if an agent takes longer to respond, the environment clock still advances,
and external events may happen during its reasoning process. This design unlocks evaluations of
temporal awareness and responsiveness, which are impossible to capture in synchronous settings.


**Mobile environment** To demonstrate the versatility of the ARE abstractions, we release Mobile
as an instantiation of a consumer mobile environment. It features twelve apps (Messages, Chats,
Emails, Calendar, Contacts, Shopping, Cabs, Files, etc.) and 101 associated tools, similar in spirit
to AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024) and ToolSandbox (Lu et al., 2024). Each _“universe”_ represents
a complete instance of this environment—the full state of all apps centered around a specific user.
Applications are populated with synthetic but coherent data, seeded with personas sampled from PersonaHub (Ge et al., 2024) and propagated across apps via a dependency graph to ensure cross-app
consistency (e.g., contacts align across messaging and email, events match calendar availability).
Universes contain between 400K and 800K tokens of structured and unstructured content (excluding filesystem contents), making them suited for long-context and long-horizon tasks. Mobile is
governed by clear rules: each turn starts with a user message or a notified event and ends when
the agent replies to the user. During the turn, simulated time advances continuously, and scenarios terminate either on task completion, when constraints on time or steps are exceeded, or when
verification fails. While Mobile focuses on the consumer domain to leverage a unified app concept, the underlying ARE platform is environment-agnostic. The API definitions remain invariant
across domains—for example, the interface for a _Chats_ tool is identical whether in a mobile or desktop setting. Consequently, the architecture presented here extends naturally to other domains such
as desktop automation, customer support, and web browsing, where creating a new environment
requires only defining the relevant tool interfaces.


**Agent** **orchestration** Running agents in ARE requires an orchestration compatible with its abstractions. For a fair evaluation, we use a model-agnostic scaffold based on a ReAct loop (Yao et al.,
2023b), where the agent outputs one tool call per step in structured JSON. The orchestration is augmented with pre-step and post-step hooks: before each LLM call, notifications queued in the
environment are injected into the agent’s context; after the tool call, the agent termination condition
is checked. This minimal extension preserves the simplicity of ReAct while making it compatible
with asynchronous and multi-turn environments. Alternative orchestrations can be easily plugged in.
To ensure that this sequential scaffolding does not artificially bottleneck performance, we compared
it against a Parallel Tool Calling (PTC) orchestration in Appendix B.3.2. Results show that PTC can
improve efficiency (wall clock time and token usage) but not performance (see Table 6), confirming
that the observed limitations are intrinsic to model capabilities rather than the scaffold.


4 GAIA2: EXPANDING GENERAL AGENT EVALUATION


Building on the abstractions of ARE, we introduce **Gaia2**, consisting of 800 unique verifiable scenarios, carefully annotated by humans across 10 distinct universes in the Mobile environment,
with 101 tools each. The scenarios are organized into splits, each targeting one agent capability
defined below. To support rapid and cost-effective evaluations, we also curate a 160-scenario subset,
Gaia2-mini. The benchmark includes two augmentation setups derived from Gaia2-mini, adding
320 scenarios to the original 800 for a total of 1,120 scenarios.


4


Gaia2 evaluates agents across 1,120 scenarios. To provide a clear taxonomy, we distinguish between
**Core Capabilities** ( _Execution, Search, Ambiguity, Adaptability, Time_ ) and **Augmentations** ( _Noise,_
_A2A_ ). The five core splits comprise 800 unique, human-authored scenarios, each instantiated with a
unique event DAG and initial environment state. We treat these core categories as dominant “flavors”
rather than strictly orthogonal dimensions. In practice, any natural task is inherently compositional
(e.g., a _Time_ task often requires _Search_ and _Execution_ ). Consequently, we explicitly chose not to introduce a separate “compositional” split; our early experiments with scenarios artificially combining
three or more distinct capabilities resulted in unnatural tasks that lacked a clear evaluation signal.
Instead, we rely on the organic compositionality present in the core splits to ensure tasks remain
realistic while still allowing for clear failure-mode attribution.


**Environment** **augmentations** The _Noise_ and _Agent-to-Agent_ _(A2A)_ splits are environment-level
modifiers applied to base scenarios to stress-test robustness and collaboration. Because our verifier checks state changes rather than specific tool traces, these augmentations do not require new
annotations. In the **Noise** split, we inject controlled perturbations, including tool anomalies (e.g.,
random execution failures, signature changes) and irrelevant environment events (e.g., incoming
spam emails). In the **A2A** split, apps are replaced by “app-agents”. The main agent loses direct
access to these apps’ tools and must instead coordinate with the app-agents via messaging to solve
the task. App-agents are not fully autonomous: they are invoked on-demand to execute specific
subtasks and return a report. This setting explicitly evaluates the main agent’s ability to decompose
goals and coordinate under partial observability. In our evaluation setting, main- and app-agents use
the same underlying model.


4.2 SCENARIO DESIGN AND ANNOTATION PROTOCOL


We construct Gaia2 scenarios using the ARE annotation interface (see Appendix A.4 for details),
which lets annotators explore a generated Mobile universe. Their task is to create DAGs of write
actions and environment events as ground truth. Starting from the generated environment, annotators design scenarios that isolate and stress a single capability at a time (e.g., Adaptability, Time),
ensuring a clear signal of model strengths and weaknesses.


Each scenario undergoes multiple rounds of validation by independent annotators, followed by a
consistency check. We complement this process with automated guardrails (e.g., structural constraints on event graphs) and post-hoc difficulty calibration using a baseline agent. This combination
yields a diverse, challenging, and verifiable set of scenarios while reducing annotation errors. We
provide more details on our annotation process and guidelines in Appendix B.1.

ARE Verifier 0.98 0.99 0.95


4.3 VERIFIER


The ARE Verifier evaluates agent trajectories against a minimal oracle sequence. Unlike finalanswer judges, it is _goal-oriented_ rather than _path-optimal_ . We distinguish read from write
actions: agents may execute unlimited read steps (e.g., browsing) for exploration without penalty,
as only write steps modify the environment and count toward goals. The verifier is also orderagnostic regarding independent goals.


Evaluation covers four dimensions: (i) **Consistency** —tool names/counts must match; arguments
use exact matching for rigid fields (IDs) and LLM rubrics for flexible ones (text), with anti-hacking
checks; (ii) **Causality** —actions must respect dependency DAGs (parents before children); (iii) **Tim-**
**ing** —enforced via tolerance windows; and (iv) **Completeness** —success requires matching all oracle
write actions.


On 450 labeled trajectories (Table 1), the verifier achieves 0.98 agreement and 0.99 precision, outperforming LLM-only baselines. Beyond Gaia2, it serves as a reusable component for faithful benchmarking and RLVR training in any ARE-based environment. Further details are in Appendix B.2.


5 EXPERIMENTS


In our core experiments, we evaluate state-of-the-art models on each Gaia2 capability split (MoonshotAI et al., 2025; Gemini Team, 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Llama Team, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a). We
also test the sensitivity of models to various evaluation configurations for Time and Agent2Agent.


**Experimental setup** We use the same ReAct-style baseline scaffold (Section 3) for all evaluations
in order to ensure consistent comparisons across models and providers. All LLMs are evaluated at
full context length ( _≥_ 128K tokens), temperature 0.5, and 16K token generation limits per turn.
Scenarios are run three times to account for potential variance, and are terminated when one of the
following conditions is met:


(i) 200 steps, (ii) context overflow, i.e., the agent exceeds the available context window (failure),
(iii) verification completion, i.e., the verifier determines the trajectory outcome—either by failing
at some turn or by successfully passing verification at every turn, or (iv) timeout. The environment
provides tools and notifications via system prompts, with notification verbosity set to medium by
default: agents receive systematic alerts for high-priority events while filtering out lower-priority
background notifications.


We handle deployment issues like outages and rate limits using a simulated generation
time—pausing during responses and resuming with a matching time offset—to preserve realistic
timing while enabling robust evaluation. The ARE Verifier uses Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct at
temperature 0. For more details on our experimental procedure, please see Appendix B.4.


5.1 CORE RESULTS


Our core experimental results are presented in Table 2, Figure 5, and Figure 6. Among Gaia2 splits,
_Execution_ and _Search_ emerge as the easiest, consistent with prior benchmark saturation (Trivedi
et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). _Ambiguity_ and _Adaptability_ remain challenging, with only Claude-4Sonnet and GPT-5 (high) achieving robust performance. The _Time_ split further differentiates frontier
models: only Gemini 2.5 Pro and Sonnet achieve meaningful scores, reflecting their efficiencylatency advantages (Figure 6). _Noise_ robustness also lags, with most models scoring below 20 despite GPT-5 (high) reaching 35.4%. _Agent2Agent_ collaboration benefits weaker models more than
frontier systems (see Figure 10). Overall, GPT-5 (high) leads with 42.1% pass@1, maintaining an
8-point margin over Sonnet across all categories. Kimi-K2 distinguishes itself among open mod

els, particularly on _Adaptability_ . While instruction-following and search tasks are largely solved,
robustness, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration remain open challenges.


In Figures 6 and 7, we extend our analysis beyond raw scores to identify the finer-grained factors
that drive performance differences between models on Gaia2. In addition, since agents are ultimately
intended for deployment in production settings, we evaluate their performance in relation to their
computational cost [1] and execution time.


**Cost-performance** **trade-offs** Figure 6 reveals clear cost-performance-time trade-offs. GPT-5’s
reasoning models demonstrate direct scaling: higher test-time compute yields better performance
but longer solution times. Claude 4 Sonnet costs roughly 3× more than GPT-5 (low) for comparable
accuracy but operates much faster. Outliers include the inefficient Grok-4 and cost-effective KimiK2. While an average human annotator can solve every task, they are slower than all models,
partly due to using ARE’s GUI rather than a native OS. These findings highlight the need for costnormalized evaluation metrics. Comparing model parameters or FLOPs alone inadequately reflects
real-world deployment conditions. Success rate per dollar better captures how agents will be judged
in practice—by reliable, efficient task completion under resource constraints.


**Performance** **drivers** We examine behavioral factors correlating with Gaia2 performance. Two
hypotheses guide our analysis: (1) exploration drives success through increased tool use and systematic information gathering before write operations, and (2) comprehensive reasoning via token
generation improves performance. Figure 7 confirms both relationships: performance correlates

positively with tool calls (left) and output tokens (right). However, Claude-4 Sonnet and Kimi-K2
stand out as notable outliers, achieving high performance (35% and 21% respectively) while producing relatively few tokens—suggesting exceptional efficiency, perhaps due to larger parameter
counts or specialized architectures. Within families, we observe a striking contrast between the base
and “Thinking” variants of Claude and Qwen: the latter generate more tokens per step but take
fewer steps overall, leading to higher pass@1 and lower cost per solved scenario, effectively trading verbosity for efficiency (e.g., Qwen-235B Thinking vs. Qwen-235B). App usage patterns were
nearly identical across models (Figure 3), indicating that performance differences stem primarily
from general reasoning capabilities rather than app-specific preferences.


5.2 TIME REVEALS THE IMPACT OF INFERENCE SPEED—AND SYSTEM RELIABILITY


We evaluate Gaia2-Time in two modes. As shown in Figure 8 (left), removing generation latency
(“instant” mode) improves all models, with the largest gains for reasoning models: Sonnet rises
from 8.1% to 26.7%, and GPT-5 (high) from 0.0% to 34.4%. Weaker models improve modestly
due to the difficulty of the tasks, while Gemini 2.5 Pro combines strong performance with low
latency and therefore best supports timing requirements. In the default mode, we observe inverse
scaling in the _Time_ capability: models trade _Time_ performance for _Execution_ performance due to
longer thinking, see Figure 8 right. This underscores the need for adaptive compute—using shallow
models and performing deeper reasoning only when necessary. Besides inference speed, the _Time_
split also underlines the need for reliable infrastructure to serve responsive models without rate limits
and server downtime in order to handle time-sensitive tasks. Finally, some Time scenarios require
concurrent actions within narrow windows, which our single-threaded scaffold cannot fully express.
Parallel orchestration is a promising direction to solve this type of scenarios.


5.3 A CLOSER LOOK AT MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION ON GAIA2 WITH AGENT2AGENT

tion on Gaia2 scenarios. We focus on two models at different points in the cost-quality curve: Llama
4 Maverick, a lighter-weight model, and Claude 4 Sonnet, the strongest overall LLM on standard
Agent2Agent (Table 2).


For the weaker Llama 4 Maverick, centralized collaboration on Gaia tasks improves both performance with pass@k and operational stability. As the agent-to-agent ratio _r_ increases, we observe
more favorable scaling with repeated sampling and a lower incidence of tool-call errors per step
(Figure 9 right; Figure 10). However, the trends observed for Llama 4 are not universal. For Claude
4 Sonnet, increasing the collaborator ratio _r_ - and thus the degree of task decomposition - does
not improve cost-normalized performance under best-of- _k_ sampling: score per token plateaus with
or without multi-agent collaboration. Similarly, collaboration ratio with Agent2Agent has a weak
negative effect on tool call error frequency.


One explanation for these findings may lie in the fact that Agent2Agent induces hierarchical decomposition into decision-making. As shown in Figure 9 left, sub-goals issued by a main-agent to an
app-agent instantiate temporally extended actions akin to options (Sutton et al., 1999). Under this
lens, gains in performance may materialize only when the benefits of decomposition outweigh the
costs. For example, Agent2Agent may increase task score only when sub-goals set by main-agents
are well-scoped and both app- and main-agents are capable of reliably exchanging state & intent
during message-passing. Likewise, the addition of hierarchy can result in cascading errors and/or
saturating gains if post-training has fit models to long-form, single-agent planning and tool-use; in
this regime, coordination may introduce overhead that offsets accuracy and efficiency gains.


Heterogeneous teams open a new compute scaling axis for task automation, for example, by keeping
a strong main agent to plan/decompose tasks while swapping in cheaper app-agents to execute subgoals [2] . Empirically, replacing Llama 4 Maverick app-agents with Claude app-agents boosts pass@1
for both main-agent settings (16.2 with Llama-main, 29.3 with Claude-main), while the fully light

experimental factor alongside standard inference hyperparameters.

configuration is weakest (8.5). This suggests that for existing LLMs, Gaia2 task completion remains sensitive to execution fidelity at the app-agent level: stronger executors improve outcomes
even when the main agent is light. Similarly, pairing a strong main agent with light executors still
outperforms the all-light team (18.3 with Claude-main + Llama-app), indicating that higher-quality
sub-goal specification and critique from the main-agent contribute independent gains. These findings are consistent with prior work suggesting heterogeneous multi-agent systems can trade planning
capacity against execution fidelity to manage compute-quality trade-offs.


6 CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION


ARE introduces an asynchronous, event-driven evaluation framework with action-level verification,
enabling reproducible benchmarking directly applicable to RLVR. Its abstractions—apps, events,
notifications, and scenarios—along with the MOBILE environment provide an extensible foundation
for community-driven evaluations and RL data generation. Gaia2 demonstrates that no model dominates across all capabilities: GPT-5 (high) achieves the best overall accuracy (42% pass@1), Claude4 Sonnet offers competitive performance with lower latency, and Kimi-K2 leads among open-source
systems (20%). Scaling curves reveal fundamental cost–time–accuracy trade-offs, highlighting the
need for cost-normalized reporting.


Verification at the action level scales more effectively than end-state comparisons and supports finegrained credit assignment. The ARE Verifier matches human annotations with high fidelity (0.99
precision, 0.95 recall), while uncovering issues such as “judge-hacking.” Robust verifier design is
thus critical for both evaluation and RL training; hybrid approaches combining scalar rewards with
preference signals remain an open direction.


Finally, Gaia2’s Time split and A2A experiments underscore the critical role of orchestration. The
inverse scaling observed in Time-sensitive tasks suggests that future agents require _adaptive_ _com-_
_pute_ strategies: deploying fast, lightweight reasoning for routine tasks while reserving deeper deliberation for complex ones. Simultaneously, the A2A results demonstrate that orchestration extends
to collaboration, where heterogeneous teams can outperform monolithic models through effective
delegation.

A ARE APPENDIX


A.1 ARE FOUNDATIONS


ARE is time-driven and built on the principle that “ **everything is an event** ”. Specifically, five core
concepts work together:


1. **Apps** are stateful API interfaces that typically interact with a data source.


2. **Environments** are collections of Apps, their data, and governing rules that define system
behavior.


3. **Events** are anything that happens in the Environment. All Events are logged.


4. **Notifications** are messages from the Environment that inform the agent about Events. They
are configurable and enable selective observability of the Environment.


5. **Scenarios** are sets of initial state and scheduled Events that take place in an Environment,
and can include a verification mechanism.


A.1.1 APPS


Apps are collections of tools that interact with a data source. For instance, an Emails app contains
tools like send ~~e~~ mail and delete ~~e~~ mail that all operate on the same email database. Similar
approaches have been explored in AppWorld (Trivedi et al., 2024) and ToolSandbox (Lu et al.,
2024).


**Apps** **maintain** **their** **own** **state** Each app starts in the simulation with an initial state and keeps
track of changes as agents use its tools or as events occur in the environment. Apps store their
data internally rather than relying on external databases. This design makes it convenient to study
agent tasks that require to modify the state of the environment, and ensures that experiments can be
reproduced consistently.


**Tool** **creation** **and** **taxonomy** Apps are implemented by adding Python methods within an App
class. When the simulation runs, these methods are automatically converted into properly formatted
tool descriptions that agents can understand and use. ARE classifies tools into two types via decorators: read, which only read app states (e.g., search ~~e~~ mails), and write, which modify app
states (e.g., send ~~e~~ mail). This distinction is helpful _e.g._ for verification, see Appendix B.2. Tools
are role-scoped—agent, user, or env.


**Extensibility** Beyond _ad hoc_ app creation, ARE can also connect with external APIs through MCP
compatibility (Anthropic, 2024). The framework also offers flexible options for data storage. While
our current implementation stores data in memory, users can easily connect SQL databases or other
storage systems without changing the core framework.


**Core apps** Developers can choose which apps to include in their environment or create new ones.
However, every ARE environment includes two core apps that handle the basic interaction between
agents and their environment:


    - AgentUserInterface is the communication channel between users and agents: messages are tool calls, and user messages generate notifications (Appendix A.1.4) that agents
can process asynchronously. This enables asynchronous interactions during task execution. The interface supports two modes: _blocking_ (the agent waits for a user reply) and
_non-blocking_ (the agent continues loop regardless of reply).


    - System provides core simulation controls like get ~~c~~ urrent ~~t~~ ime (query time), wait
(pause for a duration), and wait ~~f~~ or ~~n~~ ext ~~n~~ otification (pause until an event).
When any wait tool is invoked, the simulation accelerates: it switches from real time to a
queue-based, event-to-event loop. Scenarios that would take hours in the real world can
thus run in minutes, enabling practical long-horizon testing.

A.1.2 ENVIRONMENT


An environment is a Markov Decision Process with states, observations, actions, and transition rules.
The environment state includes the states of all apps, the time manager, and the notification system.
Apps define the action space by exposing their tools. The environment runs deterministically given
a fixed starting state and seed, ensuring reproducible evaluations. It can host one or multiple agents
simultaneously, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent setups. The environment’s rules define time progression, action permissions, reward computation, and how agent actions affect the
environment state.


A.1.3 EVENTS


In ARE, an event is any agent action or app-state change. Each event is timestamped, logged.
Events can be scheduled, e.g., a friend’s message 1 minute after simulation start. This design yields
(i) _deterministic_ _execution_ —events run in scheduled order; (ii) _complete_ _auditability_ —all actions
can be replayed and analyzed; and (iii) _flexible_ _scheduling_ —events can be set at absolute times or
relative to others.


**Event** **lifecycle** Events flow through four stages described in Figure 2: (i) _creation_ - events are
created from tool calls or scheduled by the simulation; (ii) _scheduling_ - events enter a time-ordered
EventQueue with dependency management using directed acyclic graphs, supporting both absolute timing (at specific timestamps) and relative timing (relative to other events or conditions); (iii)
_execution_ - the EventLoop processes events and captures results, state changes, and exceptions;
and (iv) _logging_ - executed events are stored in an EventLog with detailed metadata for analysis,
debugging, and validation of agent behavior.


**Event types** There are different types of events. While most events track interactions within the
environment, other special events are needed to enable dynamic scenarios and verification strategies:


    - **Agent/User/Env events** are generated by tool calls. _Agent Events_ are initiated by the agent
(e.g., sending a message), _User_ _Events_ by the user (e.g., replying to the agent), and _En-_
_vironment Events_ by the simulation itself to introduce external changes (e.g., a scheduled
message from a friend).

    - **Conditional** **events** periodically check predefined conditions and complete when criteria
are met (e.g., cancel a ride only if one was booked).

    - **Validation** **events** check milestone achievement or constraint violations for verification,
and fail the simulation if not completed on timeout (e.g., stop if no ride is booked within
30 seconds of the user request).

    - **Oracle events** are pre-scheduled “ground truth” actions used by a verifier for comparison.


**Dependencies and scheduling** Events are modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as illustrated in Figure 11. An event can only be triggered upon successful completion of all its predecessors
( _e.g._, e1 processes immediately at simulation start, e4 needs both e2 and e3 to be completed). This
data structure also supports multiple branches running simultaneously to model independent events.
Conditional and Validation events can be used in the DAG to trigger other events and make the
environment more dynamic.


A.1.4 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM


At each environment step, processed events can trigger notifications according to a notification policy (see Figure 2), similar to mobile device notifications. Apart from tool outputs, notifications are
the only signals agents receive from the environment. Notifications are queued by timestamp and
exposed to agents through a notification queue, enabling asynchronous interactions. In our orchestration (see Appendix B.3), notifications are injected into the agent’s context at the beginning of
each agent step.


**Notification** **policy** The notification system follows a configurable policy—i.e., a whitelist of
events authorized to emit notifications. ARE pre-defines three verbosity levels: low (only user

validation (Val) with true/false outcomes.


messages are notified), medium (emails, messages and calendar events are notified), and high
(everything is notified), creating a graduated spectrum of environmental observability.


**Notifications and agent proactivity** Notifications are not the only way for agents to observe environment changes. For example, even if the notification policy doesn’t alert the agent when messages
arrive from contacts, the agent can still proactively check for new messages by browsing the user’s
inbox. Notifications add realism and complexity to environments, potentially creating different agent
behaviors based on whether the environment is notification-rich or notification-poor. This system
enables researchers to tackle new capabilities such as proactivity.


A.1.5 SCENARIOS


ARE shifts from static, single-turn tasks to dynamic _scenarios_ . Scenarios attempt to capture realworld complexity through temporal dynamics, events, and multi-turn interactions. This enables evaluation of agent capabilities that cannot be assessed through traditional request-response paradigms.
In practice, scenarios are implemented in a scenario.py containing the apps, scheduled events,
and arbitrary verification logic.


**Scenario** **runtime** Scenarios typically start with an environment instance and a
send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~a~~ gent tool call, waking the agent up. The environment operates on discrete
time steps, executing scheduled events and managing state transitions until the agent reaches an exit
condition, see Figure 11. All interactions with the user are through the AgentUserInterface,
with verification triggered upon task completion.


**Scenario example** Consider this two-turn scenario (see Figure 2 and Figure 12): a user asks the
agent via AgentUserInterface _“Can you ask my mom to send me our family streaming pass-_
_word?”_ . The agent is initialized from this first notification, starts checking messages, and requests
the password in the _Chats_ app; the tool calls modify the _Chats_ app state and are recorded in the
EventLog. The agent confirms to user that the request was sent, after which the environment
pauses execution and applies first-turn validation.


At turn two, the user asks a follow up question: _“As soon as I receive the password from my mother,_
_transfer it to my father”_ . The agent resumes upon the send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~a~~ gent notification, and
looks for the mother’s reply in the _Chats_ app (where it previously requested it). In the meantime,
a scheduled environment event is triggered and an _Email_ from the mother containing the code is
received. The agent reacts to this email notification by stopping searching the _Chats_ app, processes
the _Email_, extracts the code, forward it to the father, and report success to the user. Final verification
reviews the complete interaction in the EventLog, and the environment issues a termination signal
to end execution.

A.2 NOTIFICATION POLICIES IN ARE


The notification system in ARE follows a configurable policy where researchers can choose which
Env events are notified to the Agent. The Mobile environment pre-defines three notification policies with different levels of verbosity, which we describe in detail in Table 4. Note that messages
sent by the user via send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~a~~ gent are systematically notified to the agent, regardless
of the verbosity level.


Table 4: Pre-set notifcation policies in Mobile (Compressed).

**Verbosity** **Notified Environment Tools** **Description**


low None No environment events
are notified.


medium **Email:** create ~~a~~ nd ~~a~~ dd ~~e~~ mail,

i.e., between calling send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~u~~ ser and receiving send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~a~~ gent, and
adapts its strategy in response to an asynchronous notification from the environment, a new email.

A.3 UNIVERSE GENERATION


**Dependency management & consistency** To ensure cross-app coherence, we implement a structured dependency resolution system. During generation, each app queries the existing universe
state to maintain consistency—for example, when generating emails, the system first retrieves all
available contacts to ensure referenced individuals exist in the Contacts app. Similarly, calendar
events that mention other people are validated against the contact list, and ride history in the Cabs
app references locations that align with the user’s established geographic context.


We handle dependency conflicts through a priority-based resolution system where foundational apps
(e.g., Contacts) take precedence over dependent apps (e.g., Messages, Emails) as show in
Figure 13.


However, several complex inter-app dependencies remain unhandled in our current implementation.
These include temporal consistency across apps (ensuring message timestamps align with calendar
availability), semantic relationship tracking (maintaining consistent relationship dynamics between
contacts across different communication channels), and cross-modal content references (ensuring
photos mentioned in messages exist in the file system). Addressing these limitations represents
important future work for achieving fully coherent synthetic Mobile environments.


Figure 13: The dependency graph of Mobile apps. Shopping and File system are independent
apps. Contacts is the root for rest of the apps.


**Contacts** We populate contacts using personas as the foundation. To begin, we sample seed personas from the persona hub Ge et al. (2024). However, these personas are brief and lack grounding
in the universe’s location. To address this, we expand and contextualize them by incorporating the
universe location into the prompt. We sample a user persona from the generated contacts which
serves as the basis for populating the rest of the universe. A universe is based on a user persona.


An example user persona is:


**Chats** **&** **Messages** In Chats & Messages apps, we generate both group conversations and individual chats. We sample contacts between whom we have to generate the conversations. Then, we


19


provide the participants personas and prompt the model to generate a conversation with at least 10
messages alternating between participants. We prompt the model to generate conversations that are
natural and reflect the participants’ backgrounds and also ask it to include references to possible
shared experiences, interests, or cultural elements.


**Emails** Similar to messages, we prompt the LLM to generate both ‘inbox’ and ‘sent’ emails. For
inbox emails, the sender is sampled from the contact list, while for sent emails, the recipients are
selected. We provide the LLM with the user’s persona and the sampled non-user persona to generate the emails. We specifically prompt the LLM to analyze details such as age, gender, cultural
background, occupation, education level, personality traits, communication style, current life circumstances, relationships and social networks, as well as interests and hobbies, and come up with a
valid reason for writing the email.


**Calendar** We provide the LLM with the user persona and a summary of the previous week,
prompting it to generate calendar events for the current week. Next, we use these newly generated events to prompt the LLM to create a weekly summary. This process is repeated iteratively to
populate the calendar over a specified timeframe, such as three months.


**RentAFlat & City** For apartment listings, we provide the universe countries and prompt the LLM
to generate apartment listings. The City app is designed to retrieve crime rates for specific zip codes.
Using the zip codes generated for apartment listings, we prompt the LLM to produce crime rate data
as a floating-point value in the range of 1–100.


**Shopping** For the Shopping app, we integrate publicly available Amazon product dataset. For
each universe, we sample 500 products and generate discount codes applicable to select items.


**Cabs** We prompt the LLM with the user country information and generate the user’s ride history.


**Files** We employ a traditional file system hierarchy, loading it with publicly available Wikipedia
data, datasets, and images. Additionally, we also add our files that do not contain personal information. We choose to keep the file system the same for all universes.


A.4 ARE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE


Running scenarios with ARE generates rich agent execution traces that include reasoning steps, tool
calls, their outputs, notifications, and, on the environment side, temporal event flows that unfold
over simulated time periods. It is important for practitioners to be able to debug these interactions,
whose complexity requires specialized tooling. Existing development tools largely fall into one
of these categories: interactive debugging platforms (Epperson et al., 2025; Rorseth et al., 2025;
Pang et al., 2025) and data annotation/curation platforms, each with distinct UI approaches. Commercial observability tools such as Arize Phoenix [3] and Langfuse [4] primarily offer visual timeline
views and trace/span visualizations to help developers analyze agent execution, focusing on understanding behavior after the fact rather than direct interaction or editing. Academic prototypes such
as AGDebugger (Epperson et al., 2025) and LADYBUG (Rorseth et al., 2025) provide interactive
debugging with user interfaces that enable browsing conversation histories, editing messages, and
tracing execution steps, while Hippo (Pang et al., 2025) uses an interactive tree to visualize and
control chain-of-thought reasoning without focusing on tool calls, agentic behavior nor annotations.


Although there are many specialized tools for data annotation, such as commercial platforms like
Labelbox [5], they mainly focus on simplifying human-in-the-loop annotation. These tools offer features like multimodal chat editors and customizable worksheet UIs, enabling data labelers to refine
trajectories from interactive LLM sessions. Despite their power for data collection and curation, a
significant gap remains: They are designed to annotate traces of interactions and lack key points
for reproducibility and broad evaluation: 1) They annotate full multi-turn conversations, when we
want to gather tasks, environment events, and agent task success criteria; 2) they lack structured

annotations within a fully simulated and reproducible environment, which is key to capturing both
agent interaction with tools and external events, for realistic, reproducible agent traces.


To address this, we propose a single ARE Graphical User Interface (UI), a web-based platform
that enables developers to interact with the environment, visualize scenarios (see Figure 14), and
understand agent behavior and failures through detailed trace analysis and replay capabilities, and


Figure 14: ARE scenario view with event DAG (top), scenario run (bottom left) and agent logs
(bottom right).


A.4.1 ENVIRONMENT EXPLORATION


Easily exploring the environment is crucial for understanding the context available to agents when
debugging scenarios execution, and annotating new verifiable scenarios. The UI provides a comprehensive visualization of the simulated environment, displaying all available apps/tools and their
current states. Interactive app views allow users to browse app contents and interact with their tools,
_e.g._ email inboxes in Mobile, in real-time. Views are automatically generated for new apps, which
therefore doesn’t require a UI rewrite.


A.4.2 AGENT TRACE VISUALIZATION AND REPLAY


The UI presents agent multi-step interaction traces in a structured timeline view that clearly delineates agent thoughts, actions, and tool responses. Each trace element is timestamped and categorized, allowing users to follow the agent’s reasoning process, similar to the Phoenix [6] trace views
also used by smolagents [7], but extended with debugging capabilities. Developers can roll back time
by jumping back to a past event, editing thought, tool call, etc., from that step and replaying the
scenario to see what would happen with a slightly different approach, similar to setting breakpoints
and stepping through code in a standard code debugger.


A.4.3 SCENARIO VISUALIZATION


The UI provides interactive visualization of scenarios and their event DAGs introduced in Section 3,
showing how scenario events are interconnected, and their execution status in real-time. The event
graph visualization supports both scenario development and execution analysis. Before running a
scenario, users can examine event triggers, dependencies, and timing constraints of the scenario.


[6https://phoenix.arize.com/](https://phoenix.arize.com/)
[7https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents-phoenix](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents-phoenix)


21


During execution of a scenario by an agent, the interface highlights completed events and shows
the progression through the dependency graph. Developers can run through the scenario with a
given agent, see how it behaves and debug the scenario or the agent (see Figure 14). ARE is able
to simulate time progression, so users can decide to jump in time for scenarios that span long time
frames (e.g. weeks, months).


A.4.4 ANNOTATION INTERFACE


Beyond visualization, the UI includes an annotation interface - not released at this time - that
significantly reduces the cost of scenario creation and QA. This includes a graph editor that allows
to easily build a scenario event DAG. For each node, the annotator can configure tool calls, the
node’s parents, and optionally timing. For example, to create a Mobile scenario, the annotator
adds nodes representing a user initial ask (e.g. “email my travel plans”), oracle action solving
the task (e.g. “agent sent an email”), environment events that will interfere with the agent’s work
(e.g. “received an email from travel agent”), and potentially further turns. To ensure quality and
consistency across annotations, we incorporate automated checks of the created events DAG. These
checks detect and flag logical inconsistencies in event flows to annotators, such as a node without
parents or contradictory node timings. The annotation interface achieves an approximate five times
improvement in annotation time for Mobile scenarios, compared to manual approaches.

B GAIA2 APPENDIX


B.1 DETAILS OF GAIA2 ANNOTATION


B.1.1 ANNOTATION GUARDRAILS


To streamline the process and further reduce annotation errors, we implement structural constraints
directly within the ARE UI (refer to Appendix A.4 for details). The system raises real-time errors
when these are violated:


    - Only send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~a~~ gent or Env events may follow send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~u~~ ser .


    - The event DAG must be fully connected, with send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~a~~ gent as the root.
No event (Env or Agent Oracle) may be orphaned.


    - Only one branch in the event DAG may include send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~a~~ gent or
send ~~m~~ essage to ~~u~~ ser events.


    - A turn must always end with send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~u~~ ser, both in terms of DAG structure
and timeline ordering.


B.1.2 SCENARIO EXAMPLES


To build Gaia2, we define a set of capabilities that we believe are necessary – though not sufficient

- for general purpose agents. As introduced above, each of the 800 scenarios is built to emphasize
at least one of these capabilities, yielding 160 scenarios per capability split. We provide example
scenarios displayed in the ARE GUI graph editor in Appendix B.1.3.


**Execution** scenarios require the agent to take multiple write actions, which may need to be executed in a particular order. Most of the time, read actions are needed in order to gather information
for properly filling write action arguments.


Explanation: This task requires the agent to read contact information, filter based on age criteria,
and execute multiple write to update Contacts data.


**Search** scenarios require the agent to take multiple read actions in order to gather facts
from different sources within the environment. Any sequence of read operations leading
to the correct answer is considered successful as long as the answer is communicated via
send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~u~~ ser before scenario timeout. While conceptually similar to the original
GAIA benchmark’s web search tasks, Gaia2 search scenarios operate within a controlled ARE environment.


Explanation: This scenario requires the agent to cross-reference data from multiple apps (Contacts
and Chats), perform aggregation operations, and handle edge cases like ties.


All remaining capabilities tested in Gaia2 reflect tasks with a balanced number of required read
and write operations. However, each capability features an additional challenge. Namely:


**Ambiguity** scenarios reflect user tasks that are impossible, contradictory, or have multiple valid
answers, with negative consequences arising during interaction if agents make mistakes. These
scenarios test agents’ ability to recognize these issues and seek appropriate clarification from users.


23


Explanation: While this task appears straightforward, current models often struggle to identify contradictions or multiple valid interpretations, tending to execute the first seemingly valid approach
rather than recognizing the need for clarification.


**Adaptability** scenarios require the agent to dynamically adapt to environmental changes that are
consequences of previous agent actions, such as a response to an email sent by the agent, or the
cancellation of a ride booked by the agent. These events require agents to recognize when adaptation
is necessary and adjust their strategy accordingly.


Explanation: This task requires the agent to execute an initial plan while monitoring for environmental changes (the friend’s response), then adapt the plan based on new information. The agent
must demonstrate flexibility in execution while maintaining task objectives.


**Time** scenarios require agents to execute actions in due time, monitor and respond to events, and
maintain awareness of temporal relationships throughout task execution. The duration of Time
scenarios is currently capped at 5 minutes to facilitate annotation and evaluation.


Explanation: This scenario requires the agent to understand temporal constraints (the 3-minute window), monitor for events (new messages from colleagues), and execute a time-sensitive action (order
a cab).


**Agent2Agent** scenarios replace apps with app-agents. Main-agents can no longer access app tools
directly and must instead communicate with the app-agents in order to place tool calls, observe tool
call outputs, and ultimately accomplish user tasks. This transformation requires agents to develop
robust collaboration capabilities, including sub-task setting, affordance understanding, “contextsharing,” and general coordination. By default, agents and app sub-agents are instantiated with the
same scaffold and model, with good performance requiring strong sub-goal setting and sub-goal
solving. However, Gaia2 also supports heterogeneous multi-agent evaluations, i.e. where stronger
agents supervise weaker sub-agents or vice-versa.


    - Example: Same _Search_ task as above but the Contacts and Chats apps are replaced by app
sub-agents and the main agent must communicate with them in order to gather information.


**Noise** scenarios require robustness to environment noise, simulating the inherent instability of realworld systems, where APIs change, services become temporarily unavailable, and environmental
conditions shift during task execution. This category applies systematic perturbations to Gaia2
scenarios, including tool signature modifications, random failure probabilities, and dynamic environment events that are irrelevant to the task. We assess the sanity of our noise mechanisms in
Appendix B.5.2.


    - Example: Same _Adaptability_ task as above but with random tool execution errors and random environment events (e.g., messages from other people) occurring during execution.


24


B.1.3 CAPABILITY-SPECIFIC ANNOTATION GUIDELINES


In our guidelines for each capability (especially Ambiguity and Adaptability), we put strong emphasis on precise task specifications, while also acknowledging the challenge of maintaining realism
and avoiding prompts that inadvertently disclose the solution.


**Search:** Scenarios contain only one write action, which is the agent’s final answer to the user’s
question, derived from multiple read actions. Answers must be concise, easily verifiable, and avoid
complex computation.


**Ambiguity:** Scenarios that are impossible, contradictory, or inherently ambiguous. The agent is
expected to complete unambiguous steps, then inform the user of the ambiguity or impossibility.
These scenarios are single-turn: they do not include a clarification message from the User.


The user prompt must clearly instruct the agent to detect and report ambiguities, as users often have
varying preferences on how frequently and when this should occur.


**Adaptability:** Scenarios involve Env events that require the agent to revise its plan in response
to delayed outcomes of its actions. In order to meet our modeling constraints, scenarios follow a
consistent structure:


1. The user provides a task.

2. The agent acts and sends a message using send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~    - ~~u~~ ser .

3. An Env event is triggered (e.g., email reply, order cancellation). It is a consequence of a
previous agent’s action, with send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~u~~ ser as parent.

4. The agent adapts accordingly.


To increase the difficulty, distractor Env events are also included, aiming to mislead the agent into
incorrect behavior.


In order to perfectly specify expected agent behavior, the task states explicitly that the agent should
send a message to the user after completing the initial requests (before the Env events). It should
also specify what the Agent is allowed to do in the case of an Env event happening, without giving
exact hints on what steps the Agent should take.


**Time** : Scenarios assess Agent’s ability to act on time, therefore they all include at least one timesensitive oracle action.


    - Scenarios should be solvable within a five-minute window.

    - User prompts must instruct precise timing (e.g., ”after exactly 3 minutes”).

    - The verifier checks the timing of agent actions only if the oracle event has a relative time
delay greater than 1 second. [8] The agent’s mapped action must fall within [∆ _t_ _−_ 5 _sec,_ ∆ _t_ +
25 _sec_ ].

    - Distractor Env events are also included.


B.1.4 CAPABILITY TAXONOMIES


**Taxonomy of ambiguity scenarios**


    - _Impossible or contradictory tasks:_ missing key information (e.g., the User does not specify
the ride pickup location), or requests incompatible with the Environment (e.g., asking to
buy an out-of-stock item).

    - _Blatant_ _ambiguities_ _or_ _high-stakes_ _consequences:_ Multiple valid answers exist, and the
ambiguity is obvious or the user explicitly asks in a natural way to report ambiguities.


**Taxonomy of env events** Env events are classified based on their dependency:


    - _Independent_ _events_ occur without agent action and have send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~     - ~~a~~ gent as
their only parent.


8This is why actions expected “immediately” after an event are annotated with a +2 sec delay.


25


- _Dependent_ _events_ result from prior agent actions and must have
send ~~m~~ essage to ~~u~~ ser as their direct parent.


_Distractor events_ are designed to mimic relevant events and mislead the agent into incorrect behavior. By exception, distractor events may be independent but still have send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~u~~ ser as
a parent to preserve the structure of the scenario. In the Adaptability category, only dependent Env
events are used.


**Taxonomy** **of** **time** **scenarios** Time scenarios require the agent to execute one or more actions
at a specific point in time, either proactively ( _“For_ _the_ _next_ _5mins,_ _send_ _‘Hi’_ _to_ _John_ _Doe_ _every_
_30sec”_ ) or in reaction to an independent Env event ( _“When_ _this_ _item_ _becomes_ _available,_ _buy_ _it_
_immediately”_ ), or in reaction to a dependent Env event ( _“Ask the invitees whether they come to the_
_party tonight._ _Wait 1min for everyone to reply, then immediately send me the number of glass to buy,_
_I am waiting in the line!”_ ).


Taxonomy:


    - Time-based one-off task: Execute a task at a precise point in time in the future. Example:
_“Send a follow-up message to Jo in 2 minutes if she does not reply.”_

    - Time-based recurrent task: Execute a recurrent task at precise points in time. Example:
_“For the next 4 minutes, every minute, delete the new emails I receive.”_

    - Event-based one-off task: Execute a one-time task conditionally on a future trigger event.
Example: _“Purchase red running shoes as soon as they become available in size 6 for less_
_than 100USD in the shopping app”_

    - Event-based recurrent task: Automate a recurrent routine conditionally on future events.
Example: _“For_ _the_ _next_ _2_ _minutes,_ _whenever_ _I_ _receive_ _an_ _email_ _containing_ _the_ _keyword_
_’Black Friday’, immediately delete it._ _Do not talk to me in the next 2 minutes.”_


We encourage annotators to cover and combine all these types of tasks when creating Time scenarios.


B.2 VERIFICATION DETAILS


B.2.1 VERIFICATION MECHANISM


We verify scenario successful completion by comparing agent actions with a ground truth, defined
as the minimal sequence of write actions needed to solve a task. We exclude read actions from
verification since multiple reading strategies can lead to the correct set of write actions. In a
preliminary phase, the verifier checks that used tool names counters are identical in both the oracle
actions and the agent’s write actions. If this test is successful, the verifier sorts the oracle actions
in a topological order based on the oracle graph, which reflects their dependencies. Then, the verifier
proceeds to mapping each oracle action to an agent action by checking:


    - **Consistency:** the verifier tests whether the oracle action and the candidate agent’s action
are equivalent. After conducting some preliminary tests (such as ensuring that both the
oracle and agent actions use the same tool and that the oracle action is not already mapped
to another agent action), the verifier performs:


**–** **Hard check** to compare action parameters that require exactness. For example, when
replying to an email, it verifies that email ~~i~~ d value is identical for both actions, _i.e._
the agent replies to the correct email.

**–** **Soft** **check** for parameters that require more flexible evaluation, such as the content
of an email or a message. To perform a soft check, an LLM judge is prompted with
the user task as context, and the arguments from both the agent action and the oracle
action as inputs. The LLM then determines if the actions are equivalent according to
tool-specific guidelines. For example, emails verification includes guidelines to check
their signatures.

    - **Causality:** crucially, oracle actions are organized within an oracle graph, whereas agent
actions are collected from a trajectory and simply ordered by execution time. Therefore, we


26


Figure 15: Illustration of a failure (top) and a success (down) of the matching trajectory process.


must ensure that the agent does not violate dependencies within this graph. For example, if
both oracle actions A and B depend solely on action C, the agent is free to execute A and
B in any order, as long as they are executed after C; i.e. sequences C-B-A or C-A-B are
both acceptable. Once a match is found, the ARE Verifier ensures causality by verifying
that all parent actions of the oracle action have already been matched with preceding agent
actions.

    - **Timing:** scenarios can include a time delay for certain actions relative to their parent actions, which the agent must respect. The verifier evaluates whether the agent’s timing falls
within a specified tolerance window centered around the relative time of the oracle action.
To determine the relative timing of the agent’s action, it is necessary to identify which agent
action corresponds to the oracle’s parent action. This information is readily available due
to the ARE Verifier’s process. Indeed, for a given oracle action, all its parent actions must
be matched to an agent action before attempting to match the oracle action itself.


If all oracle actions are successfully matched, the verifier returns a success signal. Conversely, if any
oracle action cannot be matched to an agent action, the verifier returns a failure signal, see Figure 15
for two examples. Crucially, the verifier implicitly assumes there are no equivalent write actions,
_i.e._ user preferences are clearly stated with minimal ambiguity in the scenario tasks. For example,
sending a message using the Messages app while the oracle action uses the Chat app will trigger a
failure.


While other verification methods (Patil et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2024) compare the environment
ground truth and actual final states, verifying a sequence of write actions, which is equivalent to
comparing ground truth and actual states after each write action of the sequence, provides more
control. For example our verification allows to distinguish, _e.g._ for safety considerations, a Mobile
trajectory where the agent adds an event at the wrong place and correct itself from a trajectory where
the agent is correct at first try. Moreover, in Mobile, sequences of write actions are easier for
humans to interpret and annotate, compared to diffs of states.


B.2.2 VALIDATING MULTI-TURN SCENARIOS


Currently, we have only described how the verifier works in single-turn scenarios, where a user
assigns a single task to an agent, and the agent completes it without further interaction. However, the
Gaia2 benchmark also includes multi-turn scenarios that involve more complex interactions between
the user and the agent. For example, consider scenarios related to the Adaptability capability, where
the agent must adjust to external events. Multi-turn scenarios present two key challenges:


27


Figure 16: Insertion of a conditional trigger event in a multi-turn scenario.


    - How can we validate multi-turn scenarios?


    - More importantly, how can we run an agent in a multi-turn scenario?


Indeed, annotators plan User and Env actions based on what should occur in previous turns according to the oracle action graph. However, when an agent is launched in a scenario, it may not adhere
to the oracle’s actions, creating uncertainty about when to trigger user or environment actions.


**Multi-turn** **verifier** Answering the first question is relatively straightforward. It is sufficient to
detect when the agent sends a message to the user to delimit the turns. We can then feed the verifier
with each turn separately and accept the agent’s trajectory if all turns are successful. Note that this
validation can be performed in an online fashion after each turn or in an offline fashion once the full
trajectory is collected.


**Multi-turn execution** An efficient solution to run an agent in a multi-turn scenario is to call the
ARE Verifier at the end of each turn and only trigger the next turn if the current turn was successful.
This approach prevents running the agent when it has already diverged from the oracle path. Practically, as illustrated in Figure 16, we modify the scenario event graph by splitting it into turns and
inserting a conditional event to call the verifier and trigger the next turn. A simpler, but less efficient,
solution is to trigger the next turn each time the agent calls send ~~m~~ essage ~~t~~ - ~~u~~ ser, regardless
of what the agent did in the current turn. This approach is used for scenarios from the test set since
we do not have access to oracle actions and thus the ARE Verifier for them.


B.2.3 VERIFIER HACKING


We conducted RL experiments in which we used the ARE Verifier as a reward function. During
these experiments, we observed that the agent was able to exploit our initial version of the verifier
in scenarios related to the Search capability, where only a single write action is expected for
successful trajectories. In the observed exploit shown in Figure 17, the agent would learn to embed
strings representing increasingly complex code in write tool calls. These outputs overwhelmed
the LLM judge used for soft checks by the ARE Verifier, producing false positives. In follow-up
experiments, we found that adding a task-agnostic “style” soft check to the verifier was effective at
addressing this failure mode and preventing further reward hacking.


B.2.4 VERIFYING THE VERIFIER


Verifiers are critical components of training and evaluation pipelines, where false positive or false
negative _e.g._ via hacking can result in flawed evaluations or collapsed trainings (cf. Appendix B.2.3).
We evaluate the ARE Verifier by first deriving a series of “unit” tests from the oracle actions that the
verifier should satisfy. Typically, we apply perturbations to oracle actions that we know preserve or
invalidate the oracle trajectory validity, before submitting the oracle and perturbed oracle trajecto

message to the user. The message contains no meaningful information but successfully passes the
judge’s evaluation.

ries to the verifier and checking its verdict match the perturbation type. While these checks allow
fast iteration, they only catch anticipated behaviors. Furthermore, the perturbed trajectories do not
necessarily reflect real trajectories that could be obtained with an agent.


**Validation benchmark** We complement this initial evaluation by analyzing ARE Verifier verdicts
for 450 trajectories manually labeled with the expected verifier outcome (Success or Failure). The
trajectories were derived from running agents powered by various models on scenarios from the
Gaia2 benchmark. We compare the ARE Verifier with a simple baseline, In-context Verifier, where
an LLM is prompted with all the agent actions and criteria (causality constraints, relative time,
soft/hard checks, etc.). The same model Llama 3.3 70B Instruct is used for both verifiers. ARE Verifier achieves better accuracy than the baseline, which tends to accept agent trajectories too readily,
see Table 1.


B.2.5 CHOOSING THE VERIFIER MODEL


While we adjusted the prompts used in the various soft checks of the ARE Verifier with Llama 3.3
70B Instruct as model, we also wanted to assess whether the ARE Verifier could function effectively
with other models. To this end, we evaluated the ARE Verifier powered by different models on
450 hand-labeled trajectories, the same dataset used for Table 1. In Table 5, we observe that all the
models achieve satisfactory precision and recall scores.

B.3 AGENT ORCHESTRATION


B.3.1 MOBILE REACT LOOP


Our proposed evaluation method leverages a custom scaffolding framework built around the ReAct
(Reason and Act) paradigm. The base scaffolding implements a standard ReAct loop where agents
iteratively reason about their current state, select appropriate actions, execute those actions in the
environment, and observe the resulting outcomes. An agent step is thus defined by three substeps
Thought, Action and Observation. This cycle continues until task completion or termination
conditions are met.


At each step of this loop, our scaffolding triggers configurable pre-step and post-step methods that
can pull relevant information from the environment state or detect termination conditions based
on task-specific criteria as detailed in Figure 18. Pre-step methods gather contextual information
and validate preconditions before action execution, while post-step methods process outcomes, update internal state, and check for completion signals. This agentic modeling approach enables the
creation of sophisticated agent behaviors with minimal implementation overhead, as complex interaction patterns emerge from the composition of simple, reusable scaffolding components rather than
monolithic agent implementations.

B.3.2 ORCHESTRATION ABLATION: PARALLEL TOOL-CALLING


In our main evaluation setup, we use a standard ReAct scaffold to ensure a fair, model-agnostic
baseline that supports both closed APIs and open-weights models without requiring model-specific
integration code. However, to address the question of whether this single-threaded scaffolding acts
as a bottleneck—particularly for the _Time_ split, we conducted an ablation study comparing ReAct
against a Parallel Tool Calling (PTC) orchestration.


We evaluated three representative models (Llama 4 Maverick, Claude 4 Sonnet, and GPT-5) across
the _Execution_ and _Time_ splits. The results, presented in Table 6, reveal several key findings:


    - **Efficiency** **Gains:** As expected, PTC significantly reduces wall-clock latency and token
consumption. For instance, GPT-5 (low) shows a strong reduction in latency (∆ -435s on
Execution) and token usage (∆ -5109 tokens), primarily because it performs fewer intermediate reasoning steps per action.


    - **Performance Stability:** Despite the efficiency improvements, the impact on task success
(pass@1) is marginal. The performance deltas are generally small (ranging from -6.3pp to
+3.0pp), and crucially the relative ranking of the models remains unchanged.


    - **Orchestration** **Limits:** The _Time_ split remains challenging even with parallel execution,
confirming that the bottlenecks observed in Section 5 stem primarily from model capabilities (such as sequential reasoning and temporal planning) rather than the scaffolding
itself, as PTC results are still far from the upper-bound score computed with instant-time
generation in Figure 8.

These results confirm that our qualitative conclusions are not artifact of the scaffold and that more
research on completely novel orchestration is needed.


B.4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS


We report Gaia2 scores on a representative set of models, covering both proprietary and open-source
systems, and including both reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning models.


For evaluation, we use a ReAct scaffold that requires a Thought: and an Action: at each
step. Since some models do not reliably follow this format, we add custom stop sequences
<end ~~a~~ ction> and Observation: for models that tend to continue past a single tool call
(Claude, Kimi, Qwen). This issue is largely alleviated by provider-specific ToolCalling APIs; we
encourage reporting results with either interface (ReAct or ToolCalling).


Due to cost and time constraints, we did not evaluate every available model. For instance, Claude 4
Opus was excluded because of its very high latency and cost ($15/M input tokens and $75/M output
tokens).


We note the following special configurations for specific third-party models:


    - **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** dynamic reasoning enabled via budget ~~r~~ easoning ~~t~~ okens = -1.


    - **Grok-4:** reasoning budget capped at 16k tokens per completion. We encountered frequent
issues with xAI’s API, in particular Empty Response errors, which introduced high
variance in results.


    - **GPT-5:** temperature and top- _p_ set to 1; no custom stop sequences were applied (not supported by the API).


When evaluating reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4, Qwen), we use the same ReAct prompts
but adapt the inference client to handle reasoning-style outputs. To maintain a uniform evaluation
and preserve the (Thought, Action) structure, we discard intermediate reasoning at each step
and exclude it from the context of subsequent steps. While this approach aligns with the intended
usage of some models (e.g., Qwen), it may not be optimal for others that interleave tool use with
reasoning (e.g., GPT-5, Claude). We encourage the community to explore alternative setups to better
assess the theoretical limits of the benchmark.


B.5 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS


B.5.1 SUB-AGENT SPAWNING IN AGENT2AGENT MODE


In our Agent2Agent experiments, we record the number of instantiated sub-agents in Figure 19.
Counts are fairly consistent across model families, yet the top A2A performers also spawn more
sub-agents, suggesting stronger task decomposition.

In this experiment, we vary the probability of tool errors and frequency of random environment

significantly impact model performance, increasing noise results in deteriorating performance across
models. This aligns with our intuitions.
