high-quality Gaussian splats (a) or point maps (b) from text prompts.


ABSTRACT


The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation
and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to
combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as “generator” with
the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as “decoder”. We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing
two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit _model_ _stitching_,
i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together.
That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-tovideo generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene
geometry. To that end, we adapt _direct_ _reward_ _finetuning_, a popular technique
for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach
with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats.
Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables highquality text-to-pointmap generation.

1 INTRODUCTION


With image and video generators now a commodity, text-to-3D models that produce 3D scenes from
text prompts have become a new research frontier, with applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics,
and simulation. Early methods for 3D generation adopt Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) (Poole
et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2024b) to optimize a 3D representation, e.g. a NeRF (Mildenhall et al., 2021; M¨uller et al., 2022) or 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS, Kerbl
et al., 2023) under a pretrained 2D diffusion prior (Rombach et al., 2022). A drawback these methods
have in common is the need for slow per-scene optimization. Another line of work uses multi-stage
pipelines that first synthesize images and then lift them to 3D with a separate model (Tang et al.,
2024a; Xu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024b) or with per-scene optimization (Gao et al., 2024; Wu
et al., 2024a; Yu et al., 2025b); employ progressive warping and refinement (Shriram et al., 2025; Yu
et al., 2025a; 2024); or sequentially chain multiple generative modules (Yang et al., 2025b; Engstler
et al., 2025). The multi-stage design not only increases model complexity and engineering effort,
but also makes such models prone to error accumulation (Lin et al., 2025; Meng et al., 2025).


A recent trend is to directly generate the 3D representation with end-to-end latent diffusion models (LDMs,
Schwarz et al., 2025; LAN et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025b;a).
A prominent line of work starts from pretrained 2D image (Esser et al., 2024; Rombach et al., 2022) or video
models (Team, 2024; Yang et al., 2025e) and finetunes them
to output multi-view 2D latents, reusing the pretrained priors (Szymanowicz et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025; Schwarz
et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c; Go et al.,
2025a;b). Subsequently, a VAE-style decoder is trained to
decode those latents into the desired 3D representation, see
Fig. 2. The LDM-like design unifies 2D generation and
multi-view reconstruction within the latent space and enables efficient 3D scene generation with a compact, wellamortized decoder.


Figure 2: **Comparison with existing,**
**LDM-based** **3D** **generators.** Instead
of training a custom decoder from
multi-view 2D latents to 3D outputs,
we stitch and align an existing, pretrained 3D reconstruction model.

3D Representation


Still, two key limitations remain. First, we argue that the

of training a custom decoder from

Achilles heel of existing 2D-to-3D diffusion models is the

multi-view 2D latents to 3D outputs,

decoder. By simply repurposing the 2D VAE to produce

or less from scratch, which requires extensive training and
large datasets that are hard to obtain (Yang et al., 2025c; Szymanowicz et al., 2025; Go et al., 2025b).
This practice becomes increasingly problematic as new, better 3D foundation models emerge (Wang
et al., 2026; 2025b; 2024; Zhang et al., 2025) and the ad-hoc trained decoders of text-to-3D models
fall further behind the state of the art in 3D vision.


Second, the prevalent training scheme tends to suffer from weak alignment between the generative
model and the VAE decoder. Typically, the former is finetuned on multi-view datasets with a generative objective like a diffusion loss (Song et al., 2021; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) or
flow matching (Liu et al., 2023; Lipman et al., 2023; Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023), which only
indirectly promotes 3D-consistent latents. Moreover, the separate training may cause the latents,
even if 3D-consistent, to be out of domain from the perspective of the decoder. To mitigate that misalignment, it has been proposed to add rendering losses that promote decodable latents (Lin et al.,
2025). However, the resulting objective is based on single-step sampling and does not sufficiently
take into account the denoising trajectory, leading to weak alignment at inference.


We introduce **VIST3A** : **VI** deo VAE **ST** itching and **3** D **A** lignment. The proposed method consists of
two complementary components that address the above-mentioned limitations, see Fig. 2. First, we
resort to the concept of _model stitching_ (Pan et al., 2023; Lenc & Vedaldi, 2015; Bansal et al., 2021;
Csisz´arik et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022) to leverage powerful, pretrained feedforward 3D models for
decoding, rather than start from scratch. The idea is to attach the relevant part of a 3D reconstruction
network as a “decoder” to the latent space of a video VAE. For this to work, there needs to be one or
more layers in the 3D model whose activations are similar (up to a linear transformation) to those in
the VAE’s latent space, despite their independent pretraining. Perhaps surprisingly, this turns out to
be the case. For the 3D model, we identify the layer with the most linear relation to the LDM latents,

slice the network before that layer, and retain the downstream portion as 3D decoder. After fitting
a single, linear stitching layer (in closed form), the VAE latent space already matches the expected
input of the 3D decoder well, such that subsequent fine-tuning will be minor and not degrade the
respective generative and 3D reasoning capabilities of the two base models.


Second, we further improve alignment between the generative model and the stitched decoder
through _direct_ _reward_ _finetuning_ (Clark et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Prabhudesai et al., 2024; Wu
et al., 2024c; Shen et al., 2025). In that technique, commonly used to align diffusion models with
human preferences, reward signals are defined based on the “goodness” of the VAE output – in our
setting, the visual quality and 3D consistency of the decoded 3D representations. Maximizing these
rewards encourages the LDM to produce latents that are 3D-consistent and lie within the decoder’s
input domain, ensuring high-quality outputs. Importantly, our alignment compares video model
outputs and images rendered from the generated 3D scenes, hence it does not require labels.


In our experiments, we show that the proposed stitching scheme is applicable across a range of video
generative models and also across several different feedforward 3D models. VIST3A’s direct 3D
decoding consistently outperforms prior text-to-3DGS methods, and additionally offers high-quality
pointmap generation from text prompts.


2 RELATED WORKS


**3D generation.** Recent works have explored various 3D representations for generative modelling,
including point clouds (Mo et al., 2023; Nichol et al., 2022; Vahdat et al., 2022), meshes (Xu et al.,
2024a), voxel grids (Sanghi et al., 2023), NeRFs (Chen et al., 2023; M¨uller et al., 2022; Mildenhall
et al., 2021), and 3DGS (Henderson et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Kerbl et al., 2023). Score
distillation using 2D diffusion models is time-consuming, as it requires per-scene test time optimization (Wang et al., 2023a; Shi et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023b), while multi-stage pipelines (Yu
et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2025) lack robustness and create significant engineering
overhead. For further details on multi-stage pipelines, please refer to Appendix A.


More recently, the field has shifted towards end-to-end latent diffusion models, where the generator
operates in the latent space of a VAE, and the latter directly decodes the resulting latents to 3D
outputs. Many of these works focus on object-centric asset generation (Wu et al., 2024b; Zhao et al.,
2023; Lin et al., 2025) and train the LDM on curated datasets such as Objaverse (Deitke et al., 2023),
with single objects or bounded scenes, and controlled camera paths. Consequently, they are unable
to handle real-world challenges like strongly varying scene scale, variable lighting, etc.


To tackle such situations, recent methods (Szymanowicz et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025; Schwarz
et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c; Go et al., 2025a;b) repurpose the comprehensive
knowledge of the visual world that is implicit in 2D image generators. The general strategy is to
finetune a pretrained 2D model on multi-view data, by using generative losses to enforce crossview consistency. In many cases training is further supported by additional 3D cues like camera
poses (Li et al., 2024b; Go et al., 2025b), depthmaps (Go et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025c), or
pointmaps (Szymanowicz et al., 2025). The resulting multi-view latents are decoded to 3D scenes
with a dedicated VAE-style decoder, meaning that 3D reasoning capabilities must be rebuilt from
scratch, and that they are only weakly aligned with the generator output - limitations which we
address with VIST3A.


**Learned** **3D** **reconstruction.** A notable trend in 3D computer vision is the trend to move away
from multi-stage pipelines and iterative optimization towards end-to-end, feedforward 3D modelling. Classical reconstruction pipelines based on SfM (Hartley & Zisserman, 2003; Sch¨onberger
& Frahm, 2016) and MVS (Furukawa et al., 2015; Sch¨onberger et al., 2016) require incremental, iterative optimization, whereas recent advances like DUSt3R (Wang et al., 2024) and MASt3R (Leroy
et al., 2024) directly predict 3D point maps in one forward pass. Several follow-up works have further reduced test-time optimization (Tang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025c; Yang et al., 2025a).
Likewise, 3D Gaussian splatting has evolved from per-scene optimization to feedforward prediction (Charatan et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Ye et al., 2025). Once more, data scaling has been
a critical factor (Wang et al., 2025b; 2026). Consequently, replicating the 3D capabilities of recent
feedforward models as part of VAE training would be difficult and costly. VIST3A offers a solution
by reusing, rather than rebuilding, models like AnySplat (Jiang et al., 2025), VGGT (Wang et al.,
2025b), or MVDUSt3R (Tang et al., 2025).

Figure 3: **VIST3A constructs a 3D VAE through model stitching (top), then aligns it with a gen-**
**erative model via direct reward finetuning (bottom).** Stitching repurposes a part of a pretrained
3D vision model as decoder to obtain a 3D VAE. Direct reward finetuning simulates full-trajectory
denoising, forcing the generative model to produce 3D-consistent, decodable latents.


**Model stitching.** Recomposing the heads and tails of two different networks was initially studied
as a way to assess the equivariance of neural representations (Lenc & Vedaldi, 2015), and as an
experimental tool to compare two different representations (Csisz´arik et al., 2021; Bansal et al.,
2021). To ensure invariance against trivial affine transformations, the head of some trained network
_A_ is normally attached to the tail of another network _B_ via a linear, trainable _stitching layer_ . Besides
revealing similarities between networks that common metrics like CKA (Kornblith et al., 2019)
would miss, it was also found that different architectures that were trained on the same data can
often be stitched into a new, hybrid model with minimal degradation (Bansal et al., 2021). This
has opened the door for practical uses of stitching, e.g. DeRy (Yang et al., 2022) for resourceconstrained reassembly of pretrained models and SN-Net (Pan et al., 2023) to build networks with
varying scales. Going one step further, we demonstrate that strong 3D VAEs [1] can be obtained by
stitching a foundational 3D model to the latent space of a video VAE as its decoder, even if they
were trained independently on different data.


3 METHODOLOGY


VIST3A consists of two key components, see Fig. 3: (1) model stitching to optimally attach (part of)
a foundational 3D model as the decoder for the latent, and (2) direct reward finetuning to optimize
the alignment of the (latent) generative model with that new decoder.


3.1 MODEL STITCHING FOR 3D VAE CONSTRUCTION


Our objective is to build a 3D VAE by seamlessly combining the encoder of a video LDM and a
feedforward 3D reconstruction model. Note that, for stitching purposes, one can skip the denoising
loop, since feeding images into the encoder already gives clean latents. Let _E_ denote the encoder and
_D_ the decoder of the VAE, and let _F_ 1: _l_ ( _**x**_ ) = _fl ◦· · · ◦_ _f_ 1( _**x**_ ) = _**y**_ be the feedforward 3D network
that maps a set of views _**x**_ to a 3D output _**y**_, with _l_ the total number of layers in that feedforward
model. As shown in Fig. 3, we cut the feedforward model at layer _k_ _[∗]_ and stitch the downstream part
_Fk⋆_ +1: _l_ = _fl_ _◦· · · ◦_ _fk⋆_ +1 to the output layer of the encoder _E_, with the help of a linear _stitching_
_layer_ **S** . In doing so, we obtain a new 3D VAE _M_ stitched that outputs the same representation _**y**_ ˆ as
the original 3D model:


_M_ stitched = _Fk⋆_ +1: _l ◦_ **S** _◦E_ ( _**x**_ ) = _**y**_ ˆ _,_ _D_ stitched = _Fk⋆_ +1: _l ◦_ **S** (1)


1To be consistent with existing literature (LAN et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025c), we also use the term “3D
VAE”, although the mapping from 2D images to 3D scene is, technically, not a variational auto-encoder.


4


The front portion _F_ 1: _k⋆_ of the 3D model is discarded – but if the clean encoder latents, after the affine
warping **S**, are (almost) the same as the activations _fk⋆_, then the back portion will still produce the
same output, _**y**_ ˆ _≈_ _**y**_ . In other words, the stitched VAE _M_ stitched is an approximation of the original
3D model _F_ . It retains much of the ability to map multi-view images to a 3D reconstruction and
only requires a little fine-tuning to restore that ability.


**Step 1:** **Finding the stitching index and initialization.** To identify the layer _k_ _[∗]_ in the 3D model
whose representation is most compatible with the VAE latent, we first push a set of _N_ samples
through the encoder _E_ to obtain their latents **B** _∈_ R _[N]_ _[×][D][E]_ . Here, _DE_ denotes the dimensionality
of the encoder latent space, and _DF_ _[k]_ [denotes] [the] [dimensionality] [of] [the] [feature] [(activation)] [at] [layer]
_k_ . Then, we scan over candidate layers _k_ _∈{_ 1 _, ..., l −_ 1 _}_ of the 3D model and, for each layer in
turn, extract the activations **A** _k_ _∈_ R _[N]_ _[×][D]_ _F_ _[k]_ and fit the linear stitching layer **S** _[∗]_ _k_ _∈_ R _[D][E]_ _[×][D]_ _F_ _[k]_ that best


_F_ _[k]_ and fit the linear stitching layer **S** _[∗]_ _k_ _∈_ R _[D][E]_ _[×][D]_ _F_ _[k]_


turn, extract the activations **A** _k_ _∈_ R _[N]_ _[×][D]_ _F_ and fit the linear stitching layer **S** _[∗]_ _k_ _∈_ R _[D][E]_ _[×][D]_ _F_ that best

recovers the activations of the 3D model at layer _k_, by solving a least-squares problem:
**S** _[∗]_ _k_ [= arg min] _F_ [=]        - **B** _[⊤]_ **B**        - _−_ 1 **B** _⊤_ **A** _k._ (2)
**S** _k_ _[∥]_ **[BS]** _[k][ −]_ **[A]** _[k][∥]_ [2]

Finally, we select the stitching layer _k_ _[⋆]_ that leads to the smallest (mean squared) error, _k_ _[⋆]_ =
arg min _k ∥_ **BS** _[∗]_ _k_ _[−]_ **[A]** _[k][∥]_ _F_ [2] _[,]_ [and] [assemble] [the] [3D] [VAE] [by] [concatenating] _[E]_ [,] **[S]** _[∗]_ _k_ _[⋆]_ [and] _[F][k][⋆]_ [+1:] _[l]_ [.] [Em-]
pirically, we find that many combinations of foundational VAEs and 3D feedforward models can be
stitched in this manner, with minimal performance loss.


**Step** **2:** **Stitched** **decoder** **finetuning.** To further reduce the remaining discrepancies between the
newly assembled 3D VAE and the original 3D model, we finetune **S** and _Fk⋆_ +1: _l_ to reproduce the
predictions of the original 3D model _**y**_, using them as pseudo-targets. Practical feedforward models
produce multiple outputs (e.g., point maps, depth, poses), so we optimize a weighted sum of _ℓ_ 1
losses for all of them. Note that the fine-tuning step is self-supervised and does not require labels. In
our implementation, we restrict the stitching layer to a 3D convolution and employ LoRA (Hu et al.,
2022) for updating _Fk⋆_ +1: _l_, to prevent large deviations from the pretrained weights. For further
details, see Appendix B.1.


3.2 ALIGNMENT VIA DIRECT REWARD FINETUNING


So far, we have assembled a 3D VAE with a strong, pretrained 3D decoder. However, during text-to3D inference, the latents are not obtained from the encoder but generated from noise by the denoising
loop conditioned on the text prompt. Therefore, we must also align the generative model itself with
the 3D decoder, such that it produces decodable latents.


Previous work finetunes the generative network by minimizing generative losses over some multiview dataset. Unfortunately, that strategy does not ensure 3D-consistent latents. Even if it did, the
finetuning bypasses the decoder, hence there is no guarantee that the generated latents fall within the
distribution expected by the 3D VAE and can be decoded to meaningful outputs.


To address the disconnect between the denosing loop and the 3D VAE, we adopt direct reward
finetuning to align the two. In other words, we extend conventional, generative multi-view finetuning
with reward maximization. The conventional generative loss _L_ gen uses paired data, i.e., multi-view
images and corresponding prompts. In contrast, the proposed reward term _r_ ( _·, c_ ) relies only on the
text prompt and requires no ground-truth images. Our total loss is defined as


_L_ total = _L_ gen _−_ _r_          - _z_ 0( _θ, c, zT_ ) _, c_          - _,_ (3)


where _θ_ are the parameters of the video generative model, _c_ represents the text prompt, _zT_ is the
initial noise, and _z_ 0( _θ, c, zT_ ) is the final latent produced by the denoising loop.


**Reward.** The proposed reward function consists of three components that ensure high-quality
and 3D-consistent generation. _(1)_ _Multi-view_ _Image_ _Quality:_ As we keep the encoder frozen, the
generated latents can be decoded by the original video decoder _D_ to obtain multi-view images. We
evaluate these images against the input prompt using CLIP-based (Fang et al., 2024) and HPSv2
human preference scores (Wu et al., 2023) to promote prompt adherence and visual quality, similar
to DanceGRPO (Xue et al., 2025). _(2)_ _3D_ _Representation_ _Quality:_ To encourage high-quality 3D
outputs after decoding with _D_ stitched, we render the generated 3D scenes (pointmaps and/or 3DGS)
back into 2D views and apply the same (CLIP + HPSv2) metrics to them as above. _(3) 3D Consis-_
_tency:_ To enforce 3D consistency, we render the 3D representation from the same viewpoints as the
multi-view images reconstructed by the video decoder _D_, using the camera poses predicted by the


5


feedforward 3D model. We then compute a combination of _ℓ_ 1-loss and LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018)
for each pair of decoded and rendered images belonging to the same viewpoint. The final (negative)
reward is a weighted sum of these three losses. For further details, see Appendix B.2.


**Alignment algorithm.** To optimize the generative model according to the reward function above,
we employ direct reward finetuning (Clark et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2023; Prabhudesai et al., 2024; Wu
et al., 2024c; Shen et al., 2025). I.e., the model generates samples by unfolding the full denoising
path, and the rewards computed from these samples are then backpropagated through the denoising
chain. While the algorithm benefits from gradient-based feedback, it can also suffer from exploding
gradient norms. To stabilize the optimization, we generalize the idea of DRTune (Wu et al., 2024c):
gradients are detached from the inputs to the generative model, but retained during the update step
to the next denoising state. In this way, reward propagation remains stable even at early denoising
steps. Furthermore, we modify the optimizer for better computational efficiency by (i) randomized
sampling, using fewer timesteps than during inference, and (ii) randomizing the subset of denoising steps where gradients are backpropagated, such that the model learns from diverse denoising
trajectories. For further details, see Appendix B.2.


In summary, we perform joint, end-to-end alignment of the VAE and the generative model, unlike
conventional multi-view fine-tuning that keeps them separate. Reward tuning ensures that, throughout the iterative denoising process, the generative model remains aligned with our 3D VAE and
generates latents that suit the stitched decoder.


4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS


In what follows, we demonstrate **VIST3A** ’s text-to-3D generation performance. The main findings
are that **VIST3A** clearly outperforms existing feedforward text-to-3DGS approaches and also offers high-quality text-to-pointmap generation. Moreover, we experimentally analyze our two core
components, self-supervised _model stitching_ and _alignment finetuning_ .


4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS


We provide a high-level overview of the experimental setup. A complete description of evaluation
protocols and training details can be found in Appendix C.


**Target** **3D** **models.** We target last-generation foundational 3D vision models that have been
trained on large-scale datasets, have demonstrated generality and reliable performance across diverse domains, and require only images as input. For our experiments, we select three representative state-of-the-art models: _(1) MVDUSt3R_ (Tang et al., 2025) predicts pointmaps and Gaussian
splats, _(2)_ _VGGT_ (Wang et al., 2025b) predicts pointmaps, depth maps and camera poses, and _(3)_
_AnySplat_ (Jiang et al., 2025) predicts Gaussian splats and camera poses.


**Target** **video** **generators.** Our primary video model is Wan 2.1 T2V large (Wan et al., 2025), a
state-of-the-art text-to-video generator. To demonstrate the generality of VIST3A across different
architectures, we additionally use several other latent video models, including CogVideoX (Yang
et al., 2025e), SVD (Blattmann et al., 2023), and HunyuanVideo (Kong et al., 2024).


**Training data.** We finetune stitched VAEs on DL3DV-10K (Ling et al., 2024) and ScanNet (Dai
et al., 2017), without 3D labels. To align the video generator in latent space, we utilize DL3DV-10K
to compute the generative loss, with prompts from the HPSv2 training set (Wu et al., 2023).


4.2 MAIN RESULTS: 3D GENERATION


Stitching Wan to the 3D models listed in Section 4.1 yields two types of generative models: (i) Textto-3DGS when using AnySplat or MVDUSt3R as decoder; and (ii) Text-to-Pointmap when using
VGGT or MVDUSt3R. Both variants are evaluated in the following.


**Baselines.** Important baselines for text-to-3DGS are SplatFlow (Go et al., 2025a), Director3D (Li
et al., 2024b), Prometheus3D (Yang et al., 2025c), and VideoRFSplat (Go et al., 2025b). Additionally, we include Matrix3D-omni (Yang et al., 2025d), to our knowledge, the only other model that
unifies generation and reconstruction in latent space.

**Evaluation** **protocol.** We evaluate text-to-3DGS models on three benchmarks: T3bench (He
et al., 2023) for object-centric generation, SceneBench (Yang et al., 2025c) for scene-level synthesis, and DPG-bench (Hu et al., 2024) to assess adherence to long, detailed prompts. On T3bench
and SceneBench, we render images and compute Imaging Quality and Aesthetic Quality scores as
defined by VBench (Huang et al., 2024) to assess visual fidelity, CLIP score (Hessel et al., 2021)
for text-prompt alignment, and Alignment, Coherence, and Style scores according to Wang et al.
(2025d) as comprehensive quality metrics. We prefer to avoid traditional no-reference metrics like
NIQE (Mittal et al., 2012b) and BRISQUE (Mittal et al., 2012a) that have sometimes been used in
the context of 3D generation, but lack a meaningful connection to the conditional generation task
(e.g., they can be gambled by always returning the same sharp and colorful, high-scoring image,
independent of the prompt). For DPG-bench, we follow the suggested protocol (Hu et al., 2024),
but upgrade from the originally proposed language models to the more capable, UnifiedReward
LLM (based on Qwen 7B). Text-to-pointmap models are evaluated qualitatively, as no established
benchmarks or baselines exist.


**Quantitative** **Results.** Tables 1 and 2 show the results for the three text-to-3DGS benchmarks.
Notably, both tested VIST3A variants exhibit superior performance across all datasets and evaluation metrics. On T3bench, both Wan+AnySplat and Wan+MVDUSt3R consistently outperform all
baselines, with particularly large margins in Imaging Quality and Coherence score. For the more
complex scene-level synthesis of SceneBench, our models reach Imaging Quality scores _>_ 60 and
Coherence scores _>_ 3.8, again a marked improvement over prior art. On DPG-bench, our models greatly outperform the baselines, mostly scoring _>_ 75 (often even _≈_ 85), values that previously
seemed out of reach. The consistent gains on T3bench, SceneBench, and DPG-bench demonstrate
the effectiveness and versatility of our stitching approach for text-based 3D scene generation. We
attribute these results to the power of foundational contemporary video and 3D models, which our
stitching and fine-tuning scheme unlocks for the purpose of 3D generative modeling.


**Human** **evaluation.** To further validate the effectiveness of VIST3A, we conduct a user study
where we compare it against four other methods: Director3D, SplatFlow, Prometheus3D, and VideoRFSplat. A total of 28 participants evaluated 14 randomly selected samples drawn from T3Bench,
SceneBench, and DPG-Bench, ranking each method according to two criteria: (1) Text Alignment
and (2) Visual Quality of videos rendered from the generated 3DGS. As shown in Table 4, VIST3A
achieves the best performance (lowest average rank) on both criteria. Notably, participants rank
VIST3A as the top method in _>_ 68% of cases for text alignment and _>_ 87% for visual quality, underscoring its superiority in generating high-fidelity, semantically consistent 3D scenes.


**Qualitative** **Results.** Figure 4 qualitatively compares VIST3A (Wan+AnySplat) to several baselines. In line with the quantitative results, VIST3A produces superior, visually compelling, and
geometrically coherent renderings that closely follow the input prompts; whereas previous methods
tend to exhibit artifacts, structural distortions, and poor text alignment. Further qualitative results,
including Wan+MVDUst3R and Wan+AnySplat variants of VIST3A, as well as text-to-pointmap

on very long image sequences, VIST3A can generate coherent large-scale scenes by extending the
number of frames generated by the LDM. This demonstrates that our framework preserves the ability
of video generator and the 3D decoder to handle long sequences. Examples are depicted in Fig. 16.

4.3 MAIN RESULTS: MODEL STITCHING


Stitching the 3D foundation models from Section 4.1 with a video VAE yields two variants: a VAE
for Gaussian splats (AnySplat + video VAE) or a VAE capable of reconstructing pointmaps and
camera poses (MVDust3R or VGGT + video VAE). In the following, we evaluate both variants.


**Evaluation protocol.** For 3DGS models, we evaluate novel-view synthesis on RealEstate10K (Zhou
et al., 2018), with 8 source and 4 target images. For 3D reconstruction models, we follow Pi3 (Wang
et al., 2026) and assess pointmap quality on 7Scenes (Shotton et al., 2013) and ETH3D (Sch¨ops
et al., 2017), and camera pose estimation on RealEstate10K and ScanNet (Dai et al., 2017). Specifically, Accuracy (Acc.), Completion (Comp.), and Normal Consistency (N.C.) are used for pointmap
estimation, while camera pose estimation is evaluated with Relative Rotation Accuracy (RRA) and
Relative Translation Accuracy (RTA) at 5° and their AUC up to 30°.


**Novel view synthesis.** Table 3 reports results on RealEstate10K. Stitching AnySplat onto any video
model always improves over using AnySplat alone. We attribute the gains to the richer appearance representation of video VAE latents. The experiment is consistent with the results of Wonderland (Liang et al., 2025), where operating in latent space rather than RGB space also benefits 3DGS.
Moreover, our stitched VAEs outperform the earlier VAE-based approaches. Remarkably, we surpass Prometheus3D and VideoRFSplat despite their use of camera poses and large-scale training
data, showing that stitching high-performance 3D models is indeed an effective strategy to obtain
powerful 3D VAEs.


**Pointmap** **reconstruction** **results.** Table 5 shows that stitching preserves the accuracy and completeness of the original 3D foundation models: both pointmap quality and camera pose accuracy
barely change when using video encoder latents as input. The results confirm that stitching achieves
its goal, to take advantage of the pretrained models’ 3D reconstruction capabilities and repurpose
them for generative modeling, without relying on large training datasets or labels.


4.4 ABLATIONS


**Effectiveness of MSE for finding stitching layer (Sec 3.1).** We pick the best layer for stitching
according to a fairly simple criterion, namely the one that best supports a linear transfer of the encoder latents. To analyze the impact of this design, we train stitched decoders for the combination
(Wan+VGGT) while varying the stitching index. In Fig. 5, we see that layers with lower stitching residual indeed yield better pointmaps, supporting the MSE of the linear stitching layer as our
selection criterion.


9


This empirical trend is also consistent with existing theory: Theorem 1 in Insulla et al. (2025) shows
that the stitching risk of the hybrid network, obtained by connecting the source model’s early layers
_f_ 1 with the target model’s latter layers _g_ 2 via a linear map _S_ 1 _,_ 2, is upper-bounded by the MSE at the
stitching layer,


E� _∥g_ 2( _S_ 1 _,_ 2 _f_ 1)( _x_ ) _−_ _g_ 2( _f_ 2)( _x_ ) _∥_ [2][�] _≤_ _κ_ [2] 2 [E]       - _∥S_ 1 _,_ 2 _f_ 1( _x_ ) _−_ _f_ 2( _x_ ) _∥_ [2][�] _,_ (4)


where _κ_ 2 is the Lipschitz constant of _g_ 2. Thus, an MSE is related to the upper bound on the stitching
error, supporting our use of MSE.


Furthermore, motivated by the observation of Insulla et al. (2025) 0.7
that the right-hand side of Eq. 4 takes a similar form of kernel align- 0.6
ment, we investigate whether CKA (Kornblith et al., 2019) can track 0.5
the trend of final performance. Figure 6 reports the CKA between 0.4
the latent representation of the Wan VAE and the representations 0.3
at different layer indices of VGGT (larger values indicate greater 0.2

performance as the layer index increases; however, it is less precise
than MSE in identifying the best layer, failing to capture that the Figure 6: **CKA visualization.**
best performance is achieved at layer 2. These results suggest that, in our setting, MSE is a more
reliable indicator of transferability than CKA.


**Impact of direct reward finetuning (Sec 3.2).** As shown in Appendix D.1, direct reward finetuning
is more effective than a pretrained video model on its own, as well as that same model finetuned on
multi-view data, with each reward component contributing to the overall performance.


**Benefits** **of** **integrated** **vs.** **sequential** **3D** **generation.** In Appendix D.2, we observe that an integrated approach is more robust to noise in the latent space, which suggests it may lead to more
consistent 3D reconstruction from noise in the generation process.


Additional results in Appendix E demonstrate that VIST3A inherits prompt-based camera control
from the video backbone (e.g., responding to instructions like ”aerial droneshot”), that the stitching
analysis generalizes across multiple VAE architectures, and that our finetuning does not degrade —
and even slightly improves — video generation quality as measured by VBench.


**Additional** **results.** In Appendix E, we further show that VIST3A inherits prompt-based camera
control from the video backbone, and the stitching layer analysis generalizes across multiple VAE
architectures, and our finetuning does not degrade video generation quality on VBench.


5 CONCLUSION


We have presented VIST3A, a framework for training latent diffusion models that generate 3D
content from text prompts. Our key idea is to employ model stitching as a way to integrate the
generative abilities of modern video models with the 3D understanding of recent feedforward 3D
models. We found that this strategy indeed leads to high-quality 3D VAEs, while not requiring labeled data or massive training runs. To then align a latent-space video generator with the stitched
3D decoder it feeds into, we design a reward-based finetuning strategy. Together, these two measures yield a family of text-to-3D models with high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D outputs. In
passing, they extend 3D generation to other outputs of foundational 3D models, such as pointmaps
and depthmaps. More broadly, we see great potential for model stitching as a general tool to combine two or more foundational neural networks, including latent generative models, into powerful
end-to-end solutions.

A EXTENDED RELATED WORKS


**Pipeline-based 3D generation.** A common design pattern chains multiple modules sequentially:
a first stage generates multi-view images from text or a single image, and a second stage lifts those
views into a 3D representation (Tang et al., 2024a; Xu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024b; Li et al.,
2024a; Park et al., 2025). The reconstruction step is handled either by a large feedforward model
such as LRM (Hong et al., 2024), or by per-scene optimization of NeRFs (Mildenhall et al., 2021) or
3DGS (Kerbl et al., 2023) (Liu et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025b; Gao et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025; Wang
et al., 2025a). In both cases, the generative and reconstruction stages are trained independently,
making the overall system prone to error accumulation (e.g., view inconsistency, texture flicker) and
less robust to latent-space perturbations than joint formulations in latent space (See Section E). The
per-scene optimization variant additionally incurs substantial inference cost.


A separate line of work pursues progressive expansion and refinement (Yu et al., 2024; Ni et al.,
2025; Chen et al., 2025; Fridman et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2025a). Some methods
adopt iterative warping and inpainting (Yu et al., 2024; Ni et al., 2025; Fridman et al., 2023; Yu et al.,
2025a), while others leverage video generative models to unfold 3D scenes progressively (Chen
et al., 2025; Feng et al., 2025). Beyond these, additional works propose elaborate multi-stage
pipelines that further increase complexity (Yang et al., 2025b; Ost et al., 2025). However, such
designs are overly complex and suffer from slow inference.


**Alignment for text-to-2D models.** Several strategies have been proposed to align pretrained textto-image models with human preferences: direct finetuning with scalar rewards (Clark et al., 2024;
Xu et al., 2023; Prabhudesai et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024c; Shen et al., 2025), Reward Weighted
Regression (Peng et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2023), Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al.,
2023; Yang et al., 2024), and PPO-based policy gradients (Black et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2023; Liu
et al., 2025). Among these, direct reward finetuning offers gradient-based feedback that propagates
through the full denoising trajectory, which makes it a natural fit for our setting, where the reward
depends on the decoded 3D output.


**Concurrent** **works** **on** **interchanging** **parts** **of** **VAEs.** Concurrently, Chen et al. (2026) replace
pretrained VAE encoders with visual encoders that extract semantic representations. Their approach
does not explicitly account for the compatibility between the substituted encoder’s representation
space and the downstream decoder, and consequently requires extensive retraining. In our framework, we measure the linear transferability between the VAE latent space and each layer of the 3D
model, and stitch at the most compatible layer, which yields a well-initialized decoder that needs
only lightweight finetuning.


B METHODOLOGY DETAILS AND IMPLEMENTATION


B.1 MODEL STITCHING


**Stitching** **layer.** We implement the stitching layer **S** as a single Conv3D layer. Relying only
on Conv3D parameters to align the spatial and temporal dimensions between the latent and the
features from _Fk_ +1: _l_ can result in unnatural configurations, such as excessively large padding size.
To address this, we first interpolate the latent representation to the target dimensions and then apply
Conv3D, which provides a cleaner alignment of spatial and temporal dimensions. This design still
admits a closed-form expression of the stitching layer, as shown in Eq. 2.


**Loss function for each 3D model.** We train the stitched VAE using an _ℓ_ 1 loss between its outputs
and those of the original 3D model. Since 3D model outputs often consist of multiple components,
we compute the _ℓ_ 1 loss for each component separately and then aggregate them with a weighted sum.
Assigning equal weights can destabilize training and even cause divergence, since some components
(e.g., confidence terms) have much larger scales than others. To mitigate this, we reweight the
component losses to approximately balance their scales. The specific weighting strategy is adapted
to each 3D model as follows:


 - **MVDUSt3R.** The outputs consist of pointmaps, confidence scores for the pointmaps, and 3D
Gaussian primitives We assign a weight of 10 _[−]_ [2] to the confidence term, while pointmap and
Gaussian primitive losses are left unscaled.


19


- **VGGT.** Outputs include pointmaps, depth maps, camera poses, and confidence for both
pointmaps and depth. In addition, following VGGT’s practice, we add gradient-based regularization losses on pointmaps and depth maps. We weight the pose loss by 5, all confidence terms by
5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [3], and gradient regularization losses by 5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [3] . Other losses remain unscaled.

 - **AnySplat.** Outputs include depth maps, Gaussian primitives, confidence for both depth and
Gaussian primitives, camera poses, and anchor features. Additionally, we introduce gradientbased regularization losses on the depth maps. We weight all confidence terms by 10 _[−]_ [2], gradient
regularization losses by 5 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [3], Gaussian scale parameters by 10, and anchor features by 0 _._ 1.
Depth and other Gaussian parameters are left unscaled.


**Hyperparameters and implementation details.** For the stitching layer **S**, we adopt a single 3D
convolution with kernel size, stride, and padding chosen to align the latent features from the video
VAE with the representation space of each 3D model:


 - **MVDUSt3R:** a 3D convolution with kernel size 5 _×_ 7 _×_ 7, output channels 1024, stride 1 _×_ 3 _×_ 3,
and padding 2 _×_ 0 _×_ 0.

 - **VGGT:** a 3D convolution with kernel size 5 _×_ 3 _×_ 3, output channels 1024, stride 1 _×_ 2 _×_ 2, and
padding 2 _×_ 1 _×_ 1.

 - **AnySplat:** a 3D convolution with kernel size 5 _×_ 3 _×_ 3, output channels 1024, stride 1 _×_ 2 _×_ 2,
and padding 2 _×_ 1 _×_ 1.


Before applying the convolution, the interpolation layer recovers the temporal dimension compressed by the video VAE and adjusts the spatial size so that it matches the resolution expected
by the feedforward 3D model. The input resolution of the video VAE is set to 384 _×_ 384 for MVDUSt3R and 512 _×_ 512 for both AnySplat and VGGT, as these configurations empirically yield
stable training for the respective generative backbones. We employ LoRA with rank _r_ = 64 and
scaling factor _a_ = 32 to Conv2D and linear layers across all cases.


B.2 DIRECT REWARD FINETUNING


**Reward** **details.** We combine CLIP-based scores and HPSv2.1 human preference scores to construct rewards for both multi-view image quality and 3D representation quality. Specifically, we use
DFN (Fang et al., 2024) as the CLIP model and HPSv2.1 (Wu et al., 2023). Given an image _I_ and
its associated prompt _c_, we denote the HPSv2.1 score as _s_ hps and the DFN CLIP score as _s_ clip. The
quality reward is then defined as


_R_ quality( _I, c_ ) = _s_ clip( _I, c_ ) + _s_ hps( _I, c_ ) _−_ 2 _,_ (5)


which implies that maximizing the reward is equivalent to maximizing the underlying score.


For the **multi-view** **image** **quality** **reward**, we compute the scores using the multi-view images
decoded from the video decoder and their corresponding prompts. For the **3D representation qual-**
**ity reward**, we compute the scores using the rendered images obtained from the 3D representation
reconstructed by the stitched decoder, together with the same prompts.


The 3D consistency reward is computed as a combination of the pixel-level _ℓ_ 1 loss and the LPIPS
between a decoded multi-view image and its corresponding rendering from the reconstructed 3D
representation. Formally, given a decoded image _I_ decode and the estimated camera pose _π_ ˆ predicted
by the stitched decoder, we obtain the rendered image _I_ rendered(ˆ _π_ ) from the 3D representation. The
consistency reward is then defined as


_R_ consistency( _I_ decode _, I_ rendered(ˆ _π_ )) = _−|I_ decode _−I_ rendered(ˆ _π_ ) _|_ 1 _−_ 0 _._ 25 _×_ LPIPS ( _I_ decode _, I_ rendered(ˆ _π_ )) _._ (6)


Here, the negative sign ensures that maximizing the reward corresponds to minimizing both the _ℓ_ 1
distance and the perceptual discrepancy between the decoded and rendered images.


However, applying these rewards to all decoded multi-view images and their rendered counterparts
is computationally expensive. To reduce computational cost, we compute all rewards only on two
sampled decoded views and their corresponding rendered images. The final reward is then obtained
by a weighted combination of the three components: the multi-view image quality reward and the
3D representation quality reward are each scaled by 1 _/_ 16, while the 3D consistency reward is scaled
by 0 _._ 05. These scaled terms are summed to form the overall training reward.


20


**Alignment** **Algorithm.** For alignment, we adopt DRTune (Wu et al., 2024c)-style direct reward finetuning, which enables stable reward optimization through selective gradient computation.


We outline one training iteration of our
finetuning in Algorithm 1. First, we cal- **Algorithm 1**

**Hyperparameter** **in** **sampling** **process.** For generating samples required in the [ _T_ 1 _, T_ 2] direct
reward tuning stage, we set _T_ 1 = 10 and _T_ 2 = 50 in Algorithm 1, ensuring that the number of
diffusion steps is smaller than the typical steps in inference. The number of gradient-enabled steps
is set to _K_ = 2 to reduce memory consumption during training. For scheduling, we adopt the default
scheduler from Wan 2.1 (Wan et al., 2025).


C DETAILS ON EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS


C.1 TRAINING SETUP


**Setup for stitching layer search.** To identify the stitching layer, we rely on representations from the
feedforward 3D model and the corresponding latents computed on the same dataset. Specifically, we
utilize a subset of the DL3DV dataset, comprising 200 scenes for VGGT, 800 scenes for AnySplat,
and 3,200 scenes for MVDUSt3R, with only 13 views per scene used for the search. We limit our
search to the encoder layers of each model, as we observe that MSE values consistently increase
within deeper layer indices.


**Setup** **for** **stitched** **VAE** **finetuning.** We train on a combination of the DL3DV and ScanNet
datasets, defining one epoch as a full pass over DL3DV and two passes over ScanNet. For each
training iteration, a number of scenes are sampled according to the batch size. From each selected
scene, we randomly sample 9 or 13 views to serve as input samples for training. The models are
trained for 50 epochs in total. The batch sizes are set to 12 for VGGT, 24 for MVDUSt3R, and 12
for AnySplat. The learning rate is fixed at 2 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [4] for all models with cosine decay scheduling
and 500-step warmup. For training, we use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019), apply gradient
clipping with a norm threshold of 1.0, and use gradient checkpointing on each stitched VAE block
to reduce memory consumption. In addition to LoRA parameters, for AnySplat and VGGT, we also
finetune register tokens and class tokens. This is necessary because we remove the earlier layers that
originally process these tokens into intermediate representations, requiring adaptation of the token
handling mechanism. We further utilize gradient checkpointing for every stitched VAE block.


**Setup for generative model finetuning.** We finetune the generative models using only the DL3DV
dataset. For generative loss computation, we use a batch size of 12 with 13 views per scene. Reward
calculation uses a prompt batch size of 4, with 13 views for AnySplat and MVDUSt3R, and 9 views
for VGGT. We again adopt AdamW with a learning rate of 1 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [4], apply gradient clipping at a
0.1 norm, and train LoRA parameters with rank 8 and alpha 16. Gradient checkpointing is enabled
for all model blocks to reduce memory usage.


21


C.2 DETAILED EVALUATION PROTOCOL


**Details for 3D generation evaluation.** For T3Bench, we evaluate on all 300 prompts, in contrast
to prior works that considered only the 100 single-object-with-surroundings subset. SceneBench is
evaluated on 80 prompts from the Prometheus3D (Yang et al., 2025c) prompt set, targeting scenelevel generation. For DPG-Bench, we sample 100 prompts from the original 1K-prompt dataset.


For Matrix3D-omni, we used their official code for text-to-generation and employed Panorama LRM
for reconstruction during inference. For SDS-based methods like SplatFlow and Director3D that
perform refinement, we evaluated the final results after SDS optimization. We generate 13 frames
for all models using 80 denoising steps, and apply classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2021)
with a scale of 7.5. We observed that the Gaussian splatting produced by the MVDUSt3R model
does not generalize well across diverse domains, often failing to estimate the scale of primitives. To
address this issue, we refined the Gaussian primitives using the source view for 100 optimization
steps, minimizing a reconstruction loss defined as MSE + 0.05 × LPIPS. For this refinement, we
used the Adam optimizer with separate learning rates for each parameter group: 2e-4 for means,
5e-4 for opacity, 5e-4 for scale, 1e-4 for rotation, and 0 for rgbs. This lightweight refinement effectively corrected the scale estimation errors. For our text-to-3DGS evaluation, we render 8 random
viewpoints from the generated Gaussian Splatting representations for assessment.


We evaluate our method and baselines across a range of metrics. To measure the semantic similarity
between the input prompt and the rendered images of the generated 3DGS, we compute the CLIP
score using the clip-vit-base-patch16 model. Additionally, we adopt the VBench (Huang et al., 2024)
framework to assess key image properties. For Imaging Quality, which targets low-level distortions,
we employ the same MUSIQ model (Ke et al., 2021) in VBench. For Aesthetic Quality, we use
the LAION aesthetic predictor to evaluate the color richness and artistic merits, again following
VBench. The predictor’s native 0-10 rating is linearly normalized to a 0-1 scale for our analysis.


For a more comprehensive assessment of generative quality, we utilize the Unified Reward
model (Wang et al., 2025d), which is based on the powerful Qwen 2.5-7B Vision Language
Model (Team, 2025) [2] . This provides fine-grained, pointwise scores on complex attributes equipped
with a powerful understanding capability. By feeding the input prompt and rendered images into a
format adapted from the official implementation script [3], we obtain scores for three key aspects:


 - _Alignment_ : How well the image content matches the text prompt.


 - _Coherence_ : The logical and visual consistency of the image, free of distortions.


 - _Style_ : The aesthetic appeal of the image, independent of prompt accuracy.


This suite of metrics enables a robust and multifaceted evaluation of our model’s performance.


**Details** **for** **model** **stitching** **evaluation.** For novel-view synthesis, we follow prior works (Go
et al., 2025a;b) and adopt an 8-frame input setup to evaluate performance on 4 target views. To
accommodate the fixed-length input requirements of video VAE architectures due to temporal compression, we pad shorter sequences by duplicating the final frame. For estimating the camera poses
of the target views, we adopt the strategy from AnySplat (Jiang et al., 2025), which jointly predicts
the poses and renders the corresponding images. This contrasts with previous VAE-based methods
that presume access to ground-truth camera poses for rendering.


For pointmap and camera pose estimation evaluation, we use a 13-frame input setup. Since our
stitched VAE’s encoder is a video VAE, we arrange the multi-view images (typically provided unordered by previous works) into sequences with smooth view transitions to resemble video input.
We adopt Pi3 (Wang et al., 2026) official evaluation code and follow their preprocessing pipeline.


C.3 SELECTION CRITERION FOR 3D MODELS


In this section, we elaborate on the criteria used for selecting 3D foundation models in VIST3A.

Our primary criterion for selecting a 3D backbone is the scale of the pretraining dataset, which
mainly determines the generalizability of the model. This is because the coupled 3D model should
cover highly diverse domains of video generative models. AnySplat (Jiang et al., 2025) is selected as
it represents one of the few Gaussian Splatting models trained on such a scale. For pointmap-based
models, we utilize MVDUSt3R (Wang et al., 2024) for its balance of dataset scale and efficiency
(facilitating feasibility checks), and VGGT (Wang et al., 2025b) for its superior performance and
pretraining scale.


D FURTHER ABLATION STUDIES


D.1 IMPACT OF DIRECT REWARD FINETUNING


In the following, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of our direct reward finetuning,
comparing our full method against four well-defined baselines:


 - (1) Finetuning-free: Here, we use the original pretrained video model. Since our finetuning
freezes the encoder, its latent space remains compatible with our 3D stitched decoder.

 - (2) Multi-view Only: The model finetuned with only the flow-matching loss on multi-view data,
serving as our primary baseline before rewards are introduced.

 - (3) Multi-view + Consistency: The model finetuned with both the multi-view loss and the 3Dconsistency reward. This isolates the impact on the 3D consistency reward.

 - (4) Multi-view + Quality: The model finetuned with both the multi-view loss and the quality
reward. This isolates its impact on quality reward.


To ensure a fair comparison against reward-based methods, which often take more time for one
training iteration, the finetuning variant on multi-view data was trained for the same wall-clock
duration.


Table 6 reports the quantitative results. The finetuning-free baseline yields the lowest performance.
Lacking any 3D-aware training, it frequently produces geometrically inconsistent outputs and suffers
from significant visual artifacts when its native resolution is adapted to our 3D decoder. Introducing multi-view supervision (Multi-view Only) substantially improves 3D consistency and overall
performance, confirming the value of this training signal.


The reward components have distinct effects when added to the multi-view objective. Training
with the 3D-consistency reward (Multi-view + Consistency) leads to a notable performance drop, as
the model optimizes for geometric correctness at the expense of detail, resulting in overly blurred
images. Conversely, adding the quality reward (Multi-view + Quality) achieves substantial improvements across most metrics by enhancing prompt coherence and aesthetic appeal.


Finally, our full method, which combines both rewards with multi-view training, achieves the best
imaging quality and Unified Reward scores. While its aesthetic and CLIP scores are slightly below
the Multi-view + Quality variant, the marked improvement in imaging quality demonstrates that
our combined objective successfully guides the model to generate visually sharp and geometrically
faithful 3D representations.

Rendered 3DGS Decoded Frames


_“In the open expanse of a school's sports field, under the clear blue sky of a radiant sunny day, four vibrant American footballs are captured in_

_mid-flight. The footballs, featuring hues of red, blue, yellow, and green, are spherical in shape, contrasting sharply with the green turf below._

_Each ball glistens in the sunlight as they arc gracefully above the field, momentarily suspended against the backdrop of a few wispy clouds.”_


_A car parked on a street, its rear end facing away from the viewer against a house and trees backdrop._


Figure 7: **Qualitative** **comparison** **of** **different** **finetuning** **strategies.** Pretrained video model
(No-Finetuning) produces dynamic videos, causing severe ghosting in the reconstructed 3D scenes.
Multi-view finetuning (Multi-view only) reduces this motion and improves 3D consistency but introduces semantic and quality degradations, while our direct reward tuning (Ours) yields sharper
renderings that better align with the input text prompts.


To further analyze the effect of our training strategy, we provide a qualitative comparison between
the pretrained video model, the multi-view-only finetuning baseline, and our reward-tuned model in
Fig. 7. As shown in the decoded frames, the **No-Finetuning** baseline (pretrained video generator)
often produces dynamic videos with temporal motion. This leads to severe ghosting artifacts in the
generated 3D scenes, clearly visible as multiple outlines of the footballs and the car.


The **Multi-view only** baseline (second row) effectively suppresses this motion, enforcing 3D consistency. However, relying solely on a multi-view dataset limits the model’s generalizability, and the
lack of alignment with the decoder hinders the model from generating latents that are well reconstructible by the decoder. As a result, the generations exhibit semantic and quality degradations: the
“green” football is missing in the first example, and the car becomes blurrier in the second example.

In contrast, our direct reward tuning ( **Ours** ) applies rewards to the decoded 3D representation of
the stitched decoder, explicitly encouraging high reconstruction quality, 3D consistency, and better
alignment with the text prompt. Consequently, it produces sharper and more faithful renderings than
the baselines in both examples.


D.2 BENEFITS OF INTEGRATED VS. SEQUENTIAL 3D GENERATION


In our model-stitching design, generation and reconstruction take place in the shared latent space of
the video diffusion VAE and the stitched 3D decoder. A common alternative is a sequential pipeline
that decodes latents into RGB frames before applying a feedforward 3D model (e.g., VGGT) without
further adaptation. To probe the core benefit of our unified formulation, we injected controlled
perturbations into the latent representation, using


_z_ _[′]_ = _z_ + _α ∥z∥_ _ϵ,_ _ϵ ∼N_ (0 _, I_ ) _,_ (7)


where _α_ is a scalar controlling the perturbation strength. We then compared two paths: (i) decode
the corrupted latent to RGB and feed the images sequentially into the original VGGT (baseline), and
(ii) directly input the noised latent into our stitched 3D decoder (unified latent framework).


Figure 8 reports pointmap estimation performance on ETH3D as a function of noise level _α_ . Our
stitched VGGT consistently outperforms the sequential decode-and-reconstruct pipeline under noise
injection, indicating that the VAE decoder in the sequential path amplifies errors. Moreover, as
shown in Fig. 8d, the performance gap is observed even at noise levels ( _α_ = 1 _e_ _[−]_ [4] to 2 _e_ _[−]_ [4] ) where
visual artifacts are hardly perceptible. This suggests that the unified design offers stronger robustness, as imperceptible perturbations from the noise of generative processes can already degrade the
sequential pipeline.


E ADDITIONAL RESULTS


To comprehensively validate each component of **VIST3A**, we present additional experiments in this
section.


**Prompt-based** **camera** **control.** Modern video generative model, including Wan 2.1, can reflect
camera-related prompts such as “aerial view” and “camera pans left to right” in the generated videos.
As our framework is built upon the Wan 2.1 backbone, we inherit this property, enabling textdriven viewpoint control in 3D generation. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the prompt containing “Aerial
dronshot” induces a high-angle, downward-looking perspective (Top), whereas the prompt with
“Camera pans left to right” results in a horizontal sweeping motion that traverses the scene from left

to right (Bottom). This shows that our model effectively inherits the semantic camera instruction
understanding capability of pretrained video generative models.


**Impact of VIST3A finetuning on video generation performance.** We aim for video generative
models to produce 3D-consistent frames, and we propose a finetuning strategy toward this goal.
Here, we evaluate how much this finetuning degrades the original model’s generative capability.
To measure this, we use VBench (Huang et al., 2024), a well-established benchmark for video
generation. We generate videos using the original model by matching the resolution to the VIST3A
inference setting, and compare the video results of the finetuned model with VIST3A with Wan and
AnySplat.


As shown in Table 7, the VIST3A-adapted model achieves a higher quality score and a higher total
score than the original video generator, with only a marginal difference in the Semantic Score. This
demonstrates that VIST3A’s finetuning does not significantly degrade the video model’s generative
capability—in fact, the overall VBench performance is slightly improved under the VIST3A setup.


**Analysis on searched stitching index.** In Section 4.4, we showed that earlier layers in the network
tend to be more linearly correspondent. We extend this analysis to various VAE architectures, including CogVideoX, SVD, Hunyuan, and Wan, paired with MVDUSt3R and AnySplat, to observe
the generalizability of this finding.


Figure 10 shows the log-MSE values measuring linear transferability between latents and the feedforward 3D model’s representations. From the results, early layers of 3d models consistently show
lower MSE values across all VAE-feedforward 3D model combinations. This supports the hypothesis that latent representations capture low-level features for input reconstruction, which are more
linearly transferable to the early layers of the feedforward 3D model that also encode such features.
However, the results reveal an important distinction: while relative MSE ordering within each VAE
architecture correlates with stitching performance (as in Section 4.4), absolute MSE values across
different VAEs do not predict cross-architecture performance. For instance, CogVideoX + AnySplat
achieves the lowest absolute MSE (0.008) but delivers 21.32 PSNR in Table 3, while SVD + AnyS

Figure 10: **Log-MSE** **values** **in** **Eq.** **2** **across** **various** **video** **VAEs.** Early layers of feedforward
models show lower MSE values within each VAE architecture. While lower MSE correlates with
better stitching performance within the same VAE (e.g., layer 2 outperforms layer 16 for Wan in
Fig 5), absolute MSE values cannot predict performance across different VAE architectures. For
instance, despite CogVideoX and Hunyuan + AnySplat having the lowest absolute MSE (0.008),
SVD + AnySplat achieves the best performance (21.48 PSNR) in Table 3.


plat with a higher MSE (0.012) achieves superior performance at 21.48 PSNR. This indicates that
optimal stitching layers must be identified independently for each VAE-3D model pair.


**Additional qualitative results.** We present additional qualitative results of VIST3A with Wan +
AnySplat in Fig. 11–13. Text-to-pointmap generation results obtained by combining VGGT with
Wan through VIST3A are shown in Fig. 14. Finally, Fig. 15 illustrates VIST3A results with MVDust3R + Wan.


F LIMITATIONS


While our approach demonstrates strong results, it also has certain limitations. Our stitched model
inherits its encoder from a video generation model, which is inherently designed for sequential,
temporally coherent video input. Consequently, its performance is not guaranteed for arbitrarily
unordered inputs, such as typical multi-view image datasets. To ensure the encoder operates effectively, the input images must be arranged into a coherent sequence that simulates the smooth view
transitions of a video clip.
