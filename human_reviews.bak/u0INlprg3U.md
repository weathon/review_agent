# LIFT: Efficient Layer-wise Fine-tuning for Large Model Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Fine-tuning is widely applied in language language processing to adapt the model
for downstream tasks. However, as model sizes grow rapidly, fine-tuning the
full model is computationally expensive. Conventional studies mainly focused
on parameter-efficiency, but reducing the number of trainable parameters does
not translate to less backward computation and fine-tuning speedup. Parameter-
efficient fine-tuning still needs to perform complete backward pass to the foremost
layer to calculate required gradients. For example, Adapter reduces the trainable
parameters by 275× but the fine-tuning throughput is only 1.25× better. To achieve
real training throughput improvement, we propose LIFT: a Layer-wise fine-tuning
strategy that only learns one layer of the Transformer architecture at a time. This
approach not only reduces the number of trainable parameters but also improves
the finetuning throughput. We thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LIFT on
BERT, GPT, and LLaMA models. LIFT saves the fine-tuning memory by 3.7x and improves the throughput by 2.1x to 2.6x compared to full fine-tuning, while
maintaining the quality.

### Summary
Current parameter-efficient finetuning methods still suffer from severe efficiency problems even though the number of trainable parameters has been significantly reduced compared to the total number of model parameters. This work owes this problem to the realm that the backward process still needs to be conducted from the last layer to the very front layer, therefore, the computation cost of the backward process remains high with the decrease of trainable parameters. To this end, this work proposes a finetuning method called LIFT to solve the problem. LIFT trains one chosen layer in every training phase, thus, guaranteeing the number of trainable parameters is constrained. This work also tries to mitigate the efficiency problem in the backward process by stopping the backward computation in layers aforehand the chosen layer.

### Strengths
The problem this work focuses on is timely and valuable, for the current trend of reducing computation cost during training is to reduce the number of trainable parameters, and this work goes further. The proposed method is simple and easy to apply to existing models and may mitigate the efficiency problem.

### Weaknesses
The layer selection strategy seems overly simplified. The role and impact of training each layer in the training process are not thoroughly analyzed; only superficial observations are presented in the article. Additionally, it is questionable whether directly changing one layer of the original model will result in a loss of learning ability since changing the original network may cause greater damage to the original model abilities than other additive methods such as LoRA. Without assessing these issues, it is difficult to justify the actual effectiveness of the approach.

### Questions
The opportunity that all parameters in the model can be updated is considered an advantage of LIFT. However, if a subset of layers or parameters is responsible for certain model-learned abilities, such as few-shot learning, changing these parameters during LIFT may bring severe forgetting problems in these abilities. Please help further elaborate on the advantages of iteratively training all model layers and the potential impact of LIFT on the forgetting problem. In addition, the three scheduling schemes explained in the paper may not be able to fully cover the selection of learning sequences, and the impact of different learning sequences of the model layer on learning efficiency and final performance is not clearly analyzed. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a more specific analysis of this issue.

### Summary
The traditional approach to fine-tuning large language models, while parameter-efficient, often does not lead to significant increases in fine-tuning speed because it still requires a full backward pass during training. To address this inefficiency, a new method called LIFT (Layer-wIse Fine-Tuning) has been proposed. LIFT optimizes one layer at a time, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and the computational cost of backpropagation, leading to improved fine-tuning throughput (2.1x to 2.7x) without sacrificing model quality. When combined with existing methods like LoRA, LIFT enhances both compute- and parameter-efficiency, demonstrating up to 3.7x memory savings and up to 2.7x increased throughput. This method holds particular promise for accelerating the fine-tuning process in larger models and with bigger batch sizes, thus making advanced language models more accessible for diverse applications.

### Strengths
The manuscript offers a thorough and comprehensive comparison of various tuning methods, as detailed in Table 1, providing a well-articulated summary of the advantages and disadvantages of established tuning techniques. The impact of the newly proposed LIFT method is examined across different large language models (LLMs), including OPT and LLaMA, demonstrating its broad applicability. Furthermore, Figure 1 effectively highlights the distinct features of LIFT and clearly conveys the rationale behind introducing this new computation-efficient approach.

### Weaknesses
The main critique of the proposed LIFT method is the potential for excessive memory usage when applied to multiple downstream tasks, as it necessitates storing separate sets of weights for each task. This could become impractical for practitioners managing numerous tasks, considering the current preference for approaches like LoRA, which require minimal additional storage per task while leveraging a shared, frozen pre-trained model base. LoRA's design also supports batch processing for its minimal weights across tasks.

While the authors have mentioned the possibility of integrating LoRA with their LIFT method, the manuscript lacks detailed exploration of this combination, particularly since the presented experiments focus mainly on LIFT without incorporating LoRA.

To address this concern, the authors are encouraged to provide a more in-depth discussion on handling multiple downstream tasks with the proposed method, possibly extending the authors' experimental framework to include scenarios where LIFT is used in conjunction with LoRA. Such an investigation would not only illustrate the practicality of LIFT in common use cases but also strengthen the argument for its efficiency and versatility when combined with other parameter-efficient methods.

### Summary
The paper introduces Layer-wise Fine-Tuning (LIFT), an efficient method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). As LLMs grow in size, traditional fine-tuning becomes computationally expensive. While previous studies have focused on parameter efficiency, LIFT aims to improve fine-tuning throughput by learning one layer at a time, thereby reducing both the number of trainable parameters and the depth of back-propagation required. This approach not only saves memory but also increases throughput by 2.1x to 2.7x compared to full fine-tuning, without compromising the final model quality. LIFT is compatible with existing methods like LoRA, and its combination with these can lead to further improvements in compute and parameter efficiency. The paper evaluates LIFT's effectiveness on BERT, GPT, and LLaMA models and discusses its advantages in memory- and compute-constrained environments.

### Strengths
1. LIFT presents a novel approach to fine-tuning by updating one layer at a time, which is a creative combination of layer-wise learning and fine-tuning strategies. This method is original in its application to LLMs and addresses the limitations of prior results by reducing computational overhead.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of LIFT across different models, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing memory usage and increasing throughput. The quality of the research appears to be high, given the detailed comparisons with existing methods and comprehensive ablation studies.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the LIFT method, its implementation, and its advantages over existing fine-tuning methods. The use of figures and tables to compare LIFT with other methods enhances the clarity of the presented information.
4. The significance of LIFT is evident in its potential to make fine-tuning LLMs more accessible by lowering computational barriers. This has broad implications for the field, especially for researchers with limited computational resources.

### Weaknesses
1. While LIFT is a novel approach, the paper should discuss how it relates to and differs from the concept of greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning, which also involves layer-by-layer training.
2. The paper would benefit from a more diverse set of experiments, including fine-tuning on a wider range of tasks and datasets to fully understand the generalizability of LIFT.
3. A more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods, including those that may not focus on parameter efficiency but achieve high throughput, would be valuable.

### Questions
1. How does the selection of layers to fine-tune affect the final model performance? Is there a heuristic for selecting layers that could lead to better results?
2. Combination with Other Methods: The paper mentions that LIFT is orthogonal to methods like LoRA. Could you provide more insights into how LIFT interacts with these methods and any potential limitations of such combinations?
3. Additionally, could the authors elaborate on whether there is potential for the combined use of LIFT with other fine-tuning methods to outperform the application of either approach in isolation?
4. The Figure 1 has no *Right*.
5. Furthermore, the availability of your open-source code is eagerly anticipated.

### Summary
This paper proposes a memory- and computation-efficient way, LIFT, to fine-tune a large language model. Specifically, LIFT iteratively selects an intermediate layer and then only updates the selected layer during backpropagation. Extensive experiments on natural language processing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT.

### Strengths
- The idea of the proposed LIFT seems to be simple and effective. 
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- As the paper emphasizes memory-efficient fine-tuning, I would expect more comparison to Ladder side tuning (LST)[1]. LST adds a light-weight side module to the large backbone, and only tunes the added side module. Therefore, gradients only need to be back-propagated through the lightweight side module. On the other hand, the proposed LIFT may need to back-propagate the gradients to the front layers in the backbone sometimes. I would expect LIFT’s “peak” memory cost would be higher than LST. 
- The paper mentions that, in order for LIFT to save memory, proper implementations might be needed. Does that mean LIFT cannot be efficient on popular frameworks, like PyTorch?
