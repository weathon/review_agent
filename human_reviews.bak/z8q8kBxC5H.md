- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
The orthodox Non-negative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (oNIEP) has challenged mathematicians for over $70$ years. Motivated by applications in non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and network modeling, we consider an NIEP as follows. Consider a $K \times K$ diagonal matrix $J_{K, m} = \diag(1 + a_{K, m}, 1, \ldots, 1, -1, \ldots, -1)$,  where exactly $m$ entries are $-1$ and $a_{K, m} =  \max\{0, (2m-K)\}$.  We wish to determine for which $(K, m)$, there is a $K \times K$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ such that $Q J_{K, m} Q'$ is doubly stochastic.  Using several approaches (especially a combined Haar and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) approach) we developed, we show that in most of the cases, the NIEP is solvable. We show that these results are sharp. Also, since these are construction approaches, they automatically provide an explicit way for computing matrix $Q$. As a result,  these approaches give rise to  both a  computable NMF algorithm and sharp results for NMF. We also discuss the implication  of our results for social network modeling.

### Summary
This paper focuses on a specific instance of the doubly stochastic NIEP with a certain form of predefined diagonal matrix. The author offers sharp result for this particular NIEP and its associated NMF problem. The constructive proof enables the development of a practical NMF algorithm. The paper also explores a comprehensive characterization of scenarios encountered in the context of the doubly stochastic NIEP, marking a significant advancement, particularly in challenging cases where $m$ is large.

### Strengths
The obtained results are novel and precise, making them particularly intriguing for addressing the NIEP. The approach relying on Haar and discrete Fourier Transform is not only interesting but also holds promise, hinting at a potential in tackling the remaining challenges posed by this difficult inverse problem.

### Weaknesses
I could not identify any apparent limitations within my limited knowledge in this field; see questions part for details.

### Questions
I apologize for my limited familiarity with the solvability of the NIEP and NMF problems. I have a straightforward question: Based on my understanding of Schur decomposition, it seems that a nonnegative matrix $A$ with a given spectrum can be expressed as $A = U(\Lambda+V)U^\top$, where $U$ is orthogonal, and $V$ is upper triangular. If this is the case, does the solvability of the nonlinear system $U(\Lambda+V)U^\top\ge0$ offer a potential approach to address the NIEP problem from an optimization perspective?

### Summary
The authors give results for the Non-negative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (NIEP), which they define as follows: 
for integers $K, m$ such that $1 \leq m \leq K-1$, let $a_{K, m} = \max(0, 2m - K)$ and let $J_{K, m} = diag(1 + a_{K, m}, 1, \dots,1, -1, \dots, -1)$, then is there a orthogonal $K \times K$ matrix $Q$ such that $QJ_{K, M}Q^{-1}$ is doubly stochastic?

The authors give results for when the problem is solvable and not for various values of $m$ and $K$ by connecting it to a related Non-negative Matrix Factorization problem.

### Strengths
The authors seem to shed light on an important problem in linear algebra with applications in NMF and network modeling.

### Weaknesses
Overall the writing of the paper is quite poor. Even though it seems like the result could be important, very little exposition is given to i) stating the result the paper shows clearly (for e.g. in a clean theorem statement), ii) its connection to related/relevant works to this paper and iii) it's relevance to other problems in machine learning/applications. Especially i and ii. This makes it hard to judge the paper on its merits.

A clear introduction, statement of the results and comparison to relevant works can significantly increase the quality of this paper.

### Questions
In order to address the above concerns, can you please çlearly state -- 
1) What is the connection between the NMF problem and the NIEP problem? 
2) What is the result that this paper shows and what are already known results?

### Summary
The orthodox non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem (oNIEP) states as follows: the sufficient and necessary conditions such that the list of $K$ complex numbers $(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_K)$ is the spectrum of a $K \times K$ non-negative matrix $A$. Since it is difficult, this paper considers one of its special cases: for the integer pair $(K, m)$, under what conditions, there exists a $K \times K$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ that can be efficiently computed, such that $Q J_{K, m} Q^\top$ is doubly stochastic, where $J_{K, m} = \text{diag}(1+a_{K,m}, 1, \cdots, 1, -1, \cdots, -1)$ and $a_{K, m} =\max \\{ 0, 2m - K \\}$. The proposed problem is closely related to the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and network modeling. This paper explores the solvability of different $(K, m)$ pairs by utilizing some novel techniques, including Haar basis, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and Fiedler's approach.

### Strengths
(1) This paper researches one special case of the oNIEP that is closely related to NMF and network analysis, which are fundamental areas in machine learning.  
(2) For the proposed problem, this paper takes advantage of some novel techniques (Haar basis, DFT, and Fielder's approach) to explore the solvability of different integer pairs $(K, m)$. The proofs are technically solid.  
(3) The proposed algorithms (Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2) for NMF explicitly compute the matrix $Q$, and the results are sharp.

### Weaknesses
(1) This paper is very technical and it would be better if it could introduce more related work in the Introduction section about NIEP and NMF, etc.  
(2) This paper analyzes the solvability of the special NIEP and provides the algorithms for NMF, but does not give the time complexity of the proposed method, which lacks comparisons with some prior methods with respect to time efficiency.  
(3) Although this paper presents the application of the proposed problem in NMF and network modeling in Section 4, it is still not very clear the specific applications in NMF and DCMM. It would be better if some specific experiments were implemented for NMF and network analysis.  

Some typos:  
1) Page 7, Section 3, paragraph 1, line 3, Table 2.5 -> Section 2.5  
2) Page 8, the line above Algorithm 2, develop an more -> develop a more  
3) Page 9, Section 5, line 3, delete "analysis of" in "analysis of network analysis"

### Summary
In this paper, the authors consider a special case of the Non-negative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (NIEP) motivated by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and network modeling.
For various choices of the pair $(K,m)$, with $K$ the size of the matrix and $m$ the number of (diagonal) entries equal to $-1$, the authors demonstrate that the NIEP is solvable and provide efficient algorithm.
Some discussions are made in Section 4 on the application to NMF and network modeling.

### Strengths
The paper is technically strong and I believe, makes a significant contribution to advance the art of NIEP, by wisely combining some existing ideas (e.g., Haar and Discrete Fourier Transform approach) in a clearly non-trivial manner.

### Weaknesses
My major complaint about this paper is its presentation. 
The paper contains ton of information and is written in such a way that is not easy to follow.
It would be great if the authors could make more efforts in organizing and presenting the technical in a way more accessible to general ML/AI audience.

### Questions
I do not have specific questions, but the following comments:

1. Section 1.2: "We also show that in 2 two different cases, (N1)-(N2), Problem (1) is not solvable": redundancy here?
2. Section 2: "Theorems 2-4 are proved in the supplement" perhaps say also in which specific section of the supplement?
3. after Theorem 9: For Case (d))
4. after Lemma 13: "This motivates the following algorithm", could the algorithm be put into an "algorithm" environment here? or is it just not necessary? 
5. more generally, the authors propose to tackle Problem (1) using a construction approach by exploiting Haar and DFT basis. To me this choice of basis may not be unique, could the authors comment on the possible extension of the proposed construction?

### Summary
The paper studies chiefly the **NIEP** (Non-negative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem). This is something of a pure math question. First, recall that a matrix is _double-stochastic_ if it has non-negative entries, each row sums to 1, and each column sums to 1. Then, for all pairs $(K,m)$ where $K=1,...,\infty$ and $m = 1,...,m-1$, we want to know if there exists a rotation matrix $Q \in R^{k \times k}$ such that $Q J_{K,m} Q^\intercal$ is double-stochastic, where $J_{K,m} = \text{diag}(1+\text{max}\\{0,2m-K\\}, 1, ...,1, -1, ..., -1)$ is a diagonal matrix with $K$ rows and columns and exactly $m$ many -1's in it.

For the NIEP, the authors show that a large range of $(K,m)$ pairs either do or do not admit such a matrix $Q$. Many different constructions for such $Q$ are provided, with motivations behind these constructions varying between the _Haar Basis_, the _Discrete Fourier Transform_, a mixture of the Haar Basis and DFT, and _Fielder's Approach_.

Several $(K,m)$ pairs are not covered by this analysis, and the authors use a heuristic algorithm to show that some of these pairs likely admit a $Q$ matrix. These are the only experiments in the paper.

The NIEP is related to the **NMF** (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) Problem. Here, we are given a non-negative rank-$K$ matrix $\Omega \in R^{n \times n}$. We want to find a non-negative tall-and-skinny matrix $\Pi \in R^{n \times K}$ and non-negative diagonal matrix $P\in R^{K \times K}$ such that $\Omega = \Pi P \Pi^\intercal$. This problem is computational, and not a pure math question. By studying these various cases for the NIEP, it becomes clear that NMF is solvable in many regimes with a simple algorithm.

### Strengths
The paper studies a mathematically interesting question (NIEP), and seems to use novel constructions to answer this question. There's a lot of care and precision put into characterizing how to build these $Q$ matrices, and a really wide variety of tools are called in to participate in this task.

NMF is also a problem that's known to be interesting. If I ask around the office, people have heard of it, and know that it matters. So, there's certainly significance in improving our knowledge of when this problem is solvable, and how to solve it.

The relationship between NIEP and NMF seems to be nice and crisp. A good amount of attention is paid to showing that the authors' solution to the pure math NIEP problem implies simple algorithmic solutions to the NMF problem. This focus on pragmatism in a theoretical paper is also good and appreciated.

The writing in the paper is clear (though almost always focuses on the wrong subject matter; see "weaknesses"). I appreciate the effort taken to represent many different cases in a single paper, though I do believe this somewhat misses the point of what the paper should be trying to convey.

### Weaknesses
This paper cannot be accepted in its current state. At its core,
- The paper lacks a clear discussion in its own right that the NIEP and NMF problems are well motivated. There are exactly 2 sentences that motivate the problem studied. Instead of actually motivating the problem, these sentences instead say that someone else wrote down a good motivation. This is vastly insufficient evidence, and the paper should motivate its own problem clearly.

$\phantom{.}$

- The body of the paper contains many constructions for $Q$ matrices that solve the NIEP for various $(K,m)$ pairs. It does not, however, justify _at all_ why these constructions should work, or **any intuition at all**.
    - For a theoretical paper, this is devastating. It leaves me with no confidence that the results are correct, and the appendix is out of scope of the typical review. _(I read a bit of the appendix, to get a flavor of Theorem 2 for instance, but it was fairly cold and not laden with any helpful intuition)_
    - It would be much better to describe constructions in the appendix, and intuitively explain the ideas behind constructions in the body of the paper.

At the core of the issue of the paper are the above two issues: the paper lacks motivation, and makes no attempt to convince me of its correctness.

A lesser issue is that I do not understand if this paper is a good fit for ICLR, or really any other ML conference. The body of the paper feels a like pure math with a coat of paint on it to give it the rough shape of an ML paper. This harkens back to the motivation a bit (an unmotivated theoretical paper looks like pure math to me), but also the NIEP feels not-ML-like to me. I hesitate to get to gate-keepy about this, so I won't strongly hold this against the paper. A stronger connection to the practice of ML would go a long way.

---

I'll backup my bullet points above with some concrete evidence.

The two sentences in my first point can be found after problem (2) on page 2. Admittedly, there's some motivating sentences in the conclusion too, but that's far too late and don't actually discuss any additional motivations.

The lack of intuition and justification can be seen throughout the paper, on pages 2-6 and page 8. The most brutal examples might be the following three:
- On page 3, the first paragraph of section 1.2 states that 4 different techniques are used to design $Q$ matrices. No explanation for why these methods work is ever given. No discussion of what similar methods would or wouldn't work. No lessons to learn at all.
- On page 4, Theorems 2, 3, and 4 are all stated without any justification or argument whatsoever. They are simply stated.
- The top half of page 5 is devoted to define some intricate constructions for $Q$ matrices related to the discrete fourier transform. These constructions are followed by two theorems which state that these $Q$ matrices resolve the NIEP for some $(K,m)$ pairs. No reason connecting the construction to the theorem is given; no reason that these intricate $Q$'s are useful.

I believe that the subject matter of this paper could be published at a good venue. In the current presentation, I cannot accept this to ICLR, and I remain unclear if any ML conference is a good fit. But these seems like good research results that belong in some published venue.

### Questions
These are general minor edits, typos, ect. Feel free to ignore all of these if you want to.

1. [throughout the paper] Be sure that when you cite someone, you keep parenthesis around the citation. Not having those parenthesis makes a lot of sentences kinda hard to read. (e.g. first sentence of the introduction).
1. [throughout the paper] The language of NIEP being "solvable" is deeply confusing language. In the view of computer science, it's a deterministic problem -- for each $(K,m)$ pair there exactly 1 hardcoded answer, so the problem is "solvable". The question is really if $Q$ exists for this particular $(K,m)$ pair, which should not use the word "solvable". Instead say something like "$J_{K,m}$ can be made doubly stochastic". Or use some other phrase that sounds information-theoretic and not computational.
1. [throughout the paper] The notation of $4 | K$ is not typical in any literature I've worked in. Define this if your going to use it.
1. [page 2] Discuss condition (B) more. It's really unintuitive, and looks almost impossible to satisfy at a glance. You describe this as the "sharpest" possible bound, but I have no clue what that actually means. Assume your audience hasn't ever seen NMF before, but is interested in learning more about it.
1. [page 2] Is there a reason to omit the proof of lemma 1 instead of appendicizing it? Why not just appendicize?
1. [page 2, paragraph before "The Matrix Q"] I really like this paragraph. Good paragraph and summary!
1. [page 4] This "particularly hard and takes a long time to figure out" is not really paper-writing-language. I think this is called being "overly editorialized". You can call it intricate or something, but really you don't need to include this parenthetical at all. Alternatively, you could actually describe what made the proof so tricky and clever.
1. [page 4] I think that $H^*$ needs to be composed of $[h_{K,2}, ..., h_{K,m+1}]$ in order for $U$ to be orthogonal?
1. [page 4] Why include Theorem 6 if its implies by Theorem 10. Just cut theorem 6.
1. [page 6] The "the reason why" sentence really isn't a reason. The sentence doesn't explain why your construction _conceptually_ fails here.
1. [page 8]  Why do you pick $tr(M \hat M_0)$ to be the optimization objective? Also, why not use a uniform-at-random orthonormal matrix $\hat M_0$ -- it's not really going to make a difference in practice but seems more conceptually sound.

Do not assume that the readers know:
- What the Haar basis matrix is
- What a Perron root is
- What the Stiefel manifold is

and be sure to define these terms before you use them.
