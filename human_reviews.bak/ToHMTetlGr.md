- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (SHDA) handles the learning of cross-domain samples with both distinct feature representations and distributions.
In this paper, we perform the first empirical study on the SHDA problem by utilizing seven typical SHDA approaches for nearly 100 standard SHDA tasks. Surprisingly, we find that the noises drawn from simple distributions as source samples are transferable and can be used to improve the performance of target domain. To go deeper with the essence of the SHDA, we identify and explore several key factors, including the number of source samples, the dimensions of source samples, the original discriminability of source samples, and the transferable discriminability of source samples. Building upon extensive experimental results, we believe that the transferable knowledge in SHDA is primarily rooted in the transferable discriminability of source samples.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the problem of semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, where the source and target are characterized by different feature representations. To explore which information can be transferred in heterogeneous domain adaptation, the authors conduct expensive experiments on different heterogeneous domain adaptation benchmarks and find that the noise is transferable.

### Strengths
The authors conduct expensive experiments on the mainstream heterogeneous domain adaptation datasets and find some interesting conclusions.

### Weaknesses
Weak Points:  
1.	Although the authors draw some interesting results, where the noise can be transferred from the source to the target domain, I think this result is still counterintuitive. If the noise is transferable in semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, it also can be transferred in the unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, it is unclear why the authors limit this strong conclusion in the semi-supervised scenarios.  
2.	According to Section 5, the authors claim that the label information of the source sample might not be the primary factor that influences the performance of SHDA. Since the authors conduct the experiments with some large models like JMEA. It employs the ResNet-50, a very deep pre-trained network, which might contain some label information. Therefore, it cannot sufficiently reflect that the label information is useless. It is suggested that the authors should employ a lighter neural architecture like AlexNet to evaluate the proposed idea.  
3.	Since the authors evaluate the performance in the semi-supervised scenario, it is suggested that the authors should provide the experiment results of training with labeled target data. Because I doubt that some target-labeled data with a reasonable learning rate (to avoid overfitting) might be enough for the ideal performance.  
4.	In the part ‘Study on feature information of source samples’, the authors use features with different dimensions to denote different information, for example, D(4096) contains more information than D(800). This might be unreasonable since features with different dimensions might contain equal information.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study on the SHDA problem. The findings reveal that noise, when sampled from simple distributions as source data, can be transferable. Furthermore, the study identifies the transferable discriminability of source samples as the key factor in the knowledge transfer of SHDA.

### Strengths
1.	The empirical study is very extensive. 
2.	This paper reports a surprising finding that noise when sampled from simple distributions as source data, can be transferable.

### Weaknesses
Could you clarify the distinction between Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (SHDA) and Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) according to Definition 1? Both seem to align with Definition 1. It appears that $d_s$ and $d_t$ merely represent specific data dimensions and may not capture the heterogeneity in the nature or type of features between the source and target domains.

### Questions
• What was the rationale behind using fixed parameter settings for different SHDA tasks on the same dataset? Doesn't this approach risk not capturing the optimal performance for each task?

• In the section of analysis on the original discriminability of source samples, what led to the choice of $\lambda=0.4$ and $\lambda=0.41$?

• In the section of analysis on the transferable discriminability of source samples, when using $g_t(\cdot)$ as a single layer fully connected networks with the Leaky ReLU, is there any potential for underfitting the data?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper conducts substantial empirical experiments to explore the effects of the number of source samples, the dimensions of source samples, the original discriminability of source samples, and the transferable discriminability of source samples to semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation. However, I don’t think the experiment results can fully support the conclusions.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The work of this paper is substantial.

### Weaknesses
I do not think the experiment results can support the conclusions due to the following concerns:
1. I think the experiment of “label information” is meaningless. There is no doubt that the order of category indices would not affect the performance since they are just symbols without any semantics. Additionally, I do not think label information can be regarded as category indices.
2. In Figure 3, the performance of SSAN changes significantly when the feature dimension changes, making the conclusion that feature information is not the dominant factor not convincing.
3. In the experiment of Table 1, I think the method of not adopting transfer learning should be included since both true source samples and noises may be unhelpful in this experiment.
4. In section 6, only one target domain is tested.
5. In the experiment of “original discriminability”, I do not think category replicate and category shift are appropriate. Category replicate assigns the same category label to different category samples, which would damage the training. This damage is more serious when K is larger. So, we can not know whether the discriminability or damage causes the effect. Category shift does not alter the internal distribution. Instead, I regard the Gaussian with different means and variances to be better. Specifically, larger mean and variance differences between categories represent larger discriminability. Additionally, the conclusion that the primary source of transferable knowledge in SHDA tasks does not lie in the original discriminability of source samples is not convincing since the performance improves when LDA values increase in NK3,4,5 and 6.
6. Why the metrics for measuring discriminability are different in the experiments of “original discriminability” and “transferable discriminability”? Concretely, one is LDA values, and the other is empirical risk.
7. In Table 2, why report the average accuracy of seven methods instead of individual results as in previous experiments? It makes me feel suspicious.
8. The authors consider the noises to be transferable and the key factor to be the transferable discriminability. However, the comparison of the transferable discriminability of true samples and noises are not given in Table 2 and 3.

### Summary
This study conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation of Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (SHDA) on seven SHDA approaches across massive SHDA tasks. Based on experiment results, authors find that the noises drawn from simple distributions are transferable across domains. Further investigation shows that transferable discriminability of source samples is vital for SHDA.

### Strengths
- It's the first to conduct an empirical study investigating the SHDA problem. Comprehensive and detailed experiments are conducted.

- The paper identifies and demonstrates that noises drawn from simple distributions can be effectively transferred to target. This finding opens up new possibilities for future work direction.

- Authors reveal the primary role of transferable discriminability of source samples.

### Weaknesses
- The study is biased so the conclusion drawn from the study might not be generalizable. The features are precomputed by some descriptors  and are not learnable. However, many semi-supervised domain adaptation methods, especially those based on deep learning, are powerful because they learn the feature extraction networks to generate discriminative features. If the feature is fixed, the real power of these method cannot be realized, and the studied based on this is not generalizable. 

- The effect of the number of labeled target samples has not been studied. For semi-supervised domain adaptation, the number of labeled target samples is a crucial factor for the adaptation performance. However, this study does not cover the investigation on this aspect. 

 - The value of this study is kind of limited. Semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation is a very small field (as can be seen from the literature) and a study on such a small field can only draw attention on a small group of audience. While I agree this is valuable, the value is not very significant. We expect a study paper accepted at this conference to be of high scope so that a broad group of people can learn something from the study.
