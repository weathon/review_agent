## Abstract
Stability guarantees are crucial when ensuring that a fully autonomous robot does not take undesirable or potentially harmful actions. Unfortunately, global stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. We propose a novel methodology to learn \emph{neural contractive dynamical systems}, where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art, which provides less strong stability guarantees.

### Summary
### Problem Statement
The paper discusses the significant problem concerning the assurance of stability of data-driven controlling of robots, especially when the learned dynamics are controlled by neural networks. Stability is critical to prevent robots from executing harmful or undesirable actions. However, achieving global stability in dynamical systems learned from data proves challenging.

### Main Contribution
The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new methodology called Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS), which can guarantee contractive stability for the dynamics it learns, in both Euclidean and SO(3) manifolds.
This makes NCDS a highly adaptable learning architecture offering contractive stability guarantees and obstacle avoidance capabilities. The empirical results show that their approach encodes desired dynamics more accurately compared to existing state-of-the-art methods while providing stronger stability guarantees. Through NCDS, the authors aim to bridge the gap between learning robot dynamics from demonstrations and ensuring stability, which has been a notable challenge due to the extrapolating behavior of neural network models.

### Methodology
This methodology is designed to learn stable dynamical systems by constructing negative definite Jacobian from the output of neural network to ensure contraction, thus leading to global stability. The authors extend this method to address high-dimensional dynamical systems by developing a variant of the variational autoencoder using flow-based diffeomorphisms, which learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent space while maintaining contractive stability post-decoding. They further extend their methodology to include contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations, catering to full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The method can also be incorporated with a matrix-modulation technique to enable obstacle avoidance.

### Experiments
The paper evaluates the effectiveness and scalability of Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS) through synthetic and real-world tasks. Initial tests on 2D trajectories from the LASA dataset demonstrated NCDS's capability in capturing and replicating underlying dynamics, even in regions not covered by original data. Compared to baseline methods like Euclideanizing flow, Imitation flow, and SEDS, NCDS was the only method showing contractive behavior indicative of stability. When scaled to higher-dimensional data (LASA-4D and LASA-8D datasets), NCDS maintained a good performance, contrary to the deteriorating performance of baseline methods.

Furthermore, the obstacle avoidance capability of NCDS was showcased on the LASA dataset, with successful generation of safe trajectories around obstacles. Real-world robot experiments on a 7-DoF Franka-Emika robotic manipulator underlined NCDS's effectiveness in reproducing demonstrated dynamics and adapting to physical perturbations. The experiments collectively underline NCDS's potential in managing various aspects of robotic motion learning, ensuring stability, and navigating obstacles, crucial for advancing real-world robotic applications.

### Strengths
### Originality and Significance

This is the first work to my knowledge that endows neural network based dynamics modeling with guaranteed contractive stability, which is, as the authors point out, important to robotics as people are trying to take advantage of the modeling capacity of neural networks. The conservative and non-diverging extrapolation that comes with the contractiveness enabled by this work could also benefit neural modeling of other dynamical systems apart from robotics, as the neural ordinary differential equations are known to have difficulty modeling dynamical systems when data is not enough to cover the state space, as the unregularized extrapolation of neural networks could easily lead to numerical instability during integration. Therefore this work is not only innovative but also has potentially significant impact to the community.

### Quality

The work derives the method from contraction theory and designed practical algorithms for data-driven robotics tasks, and compared with several state of the art baselines.

### Clarity

The writing of the paper is great. It excellently motivates the work and explains the method and results well with proper details.

### Weaknesses
1. Some implementation details are missing and the codes are not available. See more in the Questions section.

2. Limitation of baseline method choices: The baselines compared to are all focused on asymptotic stability guarantees. While these are the most relevant methods for comparison, it would be interesting to see how imitation learning methods without any stability guarantee works on the tasks, to demonstrate the necessity of stability guarantee.

### Questions
1. Implementation details
   1. Is training end-to-end? What are the loss functions used for training?
   2. How are the sequential data used for training? Is each trajectory used as a whole as one data point, or cut into segments as multiple data points?
   2. Second-order?

### Summary
This work addresses the challenging problem of learning contractive dynamical systems using neural networks. The key idea is to utilize the fact that contractivity is invariant under diffeomorphisms. This motivates the use of autoencoders to learn contractive dynamics in a low-dimensional latent space. The proposed method includes a VAE architecture which naturally enforces the contractivity of the dynamics in the latent space. These results are then applied to several interesting applications, including obstacle avoidance, and learning dynamics in $SO(3)$.

### Strengths
The paper has several strengths.

* The idea of learning a low dimensional latent space embedding of the dynamics is interesting and novel, with a variety of interesting potential applications
* The construction of the VAE ensures that the contractivity is invariant to the mapping to the latent space (and vice versa)
* The proposed framework is extended to a variety of scenarios, including dynamics over Lie groups ($SO(3)$) and obstacle avoidance
* The paper itself is, generally speaking, well written.

### Weaknesses
There are a few weaknesses.

* It would be nice to have the invariance of the contractivity stated formally. 
* In the discussion section (page 9), it is mentioned that the choice of integration scheme can siginificantly affect the behaviour of the learned model. This requires further discussion. For instance, how significantly does the computation time affect the performance of the model? Is there a choice of integrator that doesn't require adaptive step-sizes (perhaps a symplectic integrator)?
* It would be helpful if the training algorithm were stated explicitly in Section 3.

### Questions
* This work focuses on learning contractive dynamics. However, suppose the system $\dot{x} = f(x)$ is *not* contractive. What can you say about the solution to the optimization problem (i.e. the feasibility of eqns (4) and (5)) in this scenario?
* In a similar vein, it seems like this work could easily be extended to (neural) controller synthesis in the latent space. Can the authors comment on this?
* Can the authors comment on the practical effectiveness of the model in greater detail? As mentioned in the discussion section (p9), the cost of numerical integration can be extensive. Have the authors come across examples where this has been an impediment to performance?
* Could the authors also address the concerns raised in the weaknesses section?

### Summary
This paper introduces a method to learn contractive dynamical systems. One method of constructing contractive systems has been to apply a diffeomorphism to provide a change of coordinates to a known contractive system. This paper proposes to use a VAE instead of a diffeomorphism, and constructs the decoder such that it is injective. As such, by enforcing that the latent dynamics is contractive, the dynamics in the data space will also be contractive. The paper also extends the method to Lie groups to account for end-effector orientation.

The paper is generally well-written, the method appears sound, and the motivations are clear. My main concerns are as follows:

1. Theorem 1 states that the contractivity is perserved under a diffeomorphism. There is a lack of analysis and formal guarentees around the assumption that an injective function acting on a lower dimensional contractive system produces a higher-D contractive system. Just as a thought experiment, what happens to coordinate points in the higher-D data space where there does not exist a coordinate in the lower-D latent space? 

2. How is the collision-avoidance on the entire manipulator handled? The learned dynamical system seems to model the end-effector pose, but collision-avoidance should be handled across the body of the robot. One approach to handle this is to pull the dynamical system to the C-space of the robot and define body-points for the collision-avoidance, as done in (Zhi 2022, L4DC). This is a relevant reference and should be reviewed, as it also takes a diffeomorphic learning approach.

Overall, I believe this is a neat idea, but more clarity around the theoretical insights is needed. I'm happy to raise my score when my concerns have been address.
