# Generalized Neural Collapse for a Large Number of Classes

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Neural collapse provides an elegant mathematical characterization of learned last layer representations (a.k.a. features) and classifier weights in deep classification models. Such results not only provide insights but also motivate new techniques for improving practical deep models. However, most of the existing empirical and theoretical studies in neural collapse focus on the case that the number of classes is small relative to the dimension of the feature space. This paper extends neural collapse to cases where the number of classes are much larger than the dimension of feature space, which broadly occur for language models, retrieval systems, and face recognition applications. We show that the features and classifier exhibit a generalized neural collapse phenomenon, where the minimum one-vs-rest margins is maximized. We provide empirical study to verify the occurrence of generalized neural collapse in practical deep neural networks. Moreover, we provide theoretical study to show that the generalized neural collapse provably occurs under unconstrained feature model with spherical constraint, under certain technical conditions on feature dimension and number of classes.

### Summary
The paper introduces the concept of "generalized neural collapse", which extends the existing understanding of neural collapse in deep classification models to cases where the number of classes is much larger than the dimension of the feature space. The study reveals that when a generalized neural collapse phenomenon occurs, one-vs-rest margins is maximized. The authors provide theoretical studies for CE loss with diminishing temperate, and under some assumptions show that the optimal solutions satisfy NC1 to NC3. The authors conduct experiments to verify the theory, and propose the method of class-mean features (CMF) classifiers to reduce training memory cost.

### Strengths
1. This paper provides a solid theoretical study of NC for a large number of classes. Specifically, the authors reduce the problem of minimizing CE loss to the HardMax problem, and prove that NC in this setting exhibits a nice combinatoric structure called softmax code. Overall, the theory part is well motivated and clearly presented. 
2. The experiments are well aligned with the theory. The proposed CMF classifier seems effective and efficient.

### Weaknesses
1. I still have concerns on the justifications for using a small temperature. The authors cite two papers [1,2] to support their claim. I am not convinced this is a general practice for the majority of works in this field. Also, I cannot find the exact number of $\tau=1/30$ in [1] claimed by the authors. In [2], the chosen loss function is negative cosine similarity, and I can not see how this is connected with CE with small temperature. Furthermore, I think considering only the diminishing temperature case oversimplifies the problem, since in this case, the problem intrinsically has a max-margin structure which aligns well with the desired NC properties. However, I cannot see why this is also true for general CE loss functions.
2. For GNC3, it is required that the Tammes problem and softmax codes are equivalent. The authors show that this is true for trivial setting, and conjecture it to be true for other settings. Since their separation metrics are quite different, I am not convinced that these two configurations are equivalent. As the experiments tricks in Section 5 are grounded on GNC3, I recommend the authors to make more clarifications on this matter. 
3. In the related works part, the authors claim that two of the related paper focuses on networks with weight decay, which is not required in this paper. However, this paper assumes that the weight and feature vectors have unit length, which is stronger than the assumptions of using weight decay. Therefore, I can not see why this makes a big distinction.

### Summary
I previously reviewed this paper in NeurIPS 2023. At that time, I thought this work was the standard for acceptance, as it received a score of 76543. However, I noted that two reviewers with lower scores did not provide an objective description of the paper's contribution.  In particular, recent studies in a similar direction tend to focus on Neural Collapse when the number of categories is smaller than the feature dimension.  The contribution of this work undoubtedly broadens the research horizon and is sufficiently significant for acceptance. In the current ICLR submission, while the core content remains largely unchanged, some questions I raised during the NeurIPS 2023 preview process have been addressed, and certain revisions have been implemented in this submission. Consequently, my review remains consistent with my previous assessment.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a clear view of the global optimal conditions for generalized neural collapse, especially for a large number of classes, while the existing work often considers a closed-form case (i.e., a simplex of ETF) in which the number of classes is smaller than the feature dimensionality. Therefore, the contribution of the work undoubtedly broadens the horizon of Neural Collapse.
- The paper's crucial contribution lies in its demonstration that minimizing the asymptotic CE loss is equivalent to achieving within-class variability collapse and aligning with softmax codes, providing valuable insights into the underlying behavior of training neural networks.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical results primarily emphasize the asymptotic CE loss rather than the original CE loss, potentially limiting the direct applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios.
- The features and class weights are constrained on the unit sphere.
- There are some minor typos, such as "where the number of classes are ... which occur" should be corrected to "where the number of classes is ... which occurs"
- Incorrect cite command in the paragraph 'Related Work' and others

### Summary
The paper delves into the mathematical characterization of learned last-layer representations and classifier weights in deep classification models, known as the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon. While existing studies on NC often focus on scenarios where the number of classes is small compared to the feature space dimension, this paper extends the understanding of NC to situations where the number of classes is much larger than the feature dimension. The authors introduce the concept of "Generalized Neural Collapse" (GNC) and demonstrate that features and classifiers display a GNC phenomenon where the minimum one-vs-rest margins are maximized. The paper provides both empirical and theoretical studies to validate the occurrence of GNC in practical deep neural networks.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-organized, allowing readers to easily follow the author's ideas. The writer makes sure the content is clear and simple, so readers from different backgrounds can understand the main points.
+ The author expanded the "Neural Collapse" (NC) idea to the "General Neural Collapse" (GNC), considering cases where the number of categories is greater than the feature size.

### Weaknesses
+ **Too strong assumption in the theoretical analysis**: $\tau \rightarrow 0$ means the norm of the feature goes to infinity, which means that a small angle between every two classes can enjoy the CE closing to $0$. Therefore, practically, GNC can not be achieved when $\tau$ is very small. 
+ **Insufficient Discussions**: The Tammes problem is the limit case of Thomson-P problem [1], authors should also consider it and provide more discussions for it, especially Thomson-1 problem.

### Summary
The paper investigates the neural collapse geometry of CE loss with normalized features and classifiers in the case of large number of classes K>d+1. They formalize two key properties (in addition to the vanilla NC1) describing the geometry: (i) Classifiers converge to an arrangement (which they call softmax code) of K vectors on the d-dim sphere that maximizes the minimum distance of one of them to the cvx hull of the rest (ii) Embeddings align with classifiers. Empirically, they demonstrate that property (ii) holds and property (i) holds for small enough temperature parameter on the CE loss. They also show that small temperature leads to good generalization. On theory front, the authors confirm the formalization by studying the corresponding UFM with temperature tending to zero. Finally, motivated by property (ii) they propose methods that avoid training the classifier weights showing that retain good performance while being less heavy on compute.

### Strengths
* important problem / open question: NC geometry for large K
* technical results appear solid although I did not have time to fully check the proofs
* result is to my knowledge novel

### Weaknesses
* the requirement for feature/weight normalization might seem restrictive. The authors mention that this is standard practice, but looking at the three references, only one of them is on CE loss. 
* the description of geometry is elegant, but is in general not explicit. Instead given as solution to a non-convex problem. It nevertheless gives an implicit way of thinking about the classifiers geometry. For d=2 it is nice to have the closed-form, but perhaps uniformity on the sphere is not very surprising (what else could it be?)
* the characterization does not specify uniquely how the classifier weights are assigned to classes. The authors discuss this under the assignment problem in Sec 4, but there does not yet appear to be a concrete answer to that

### Questions
Can you please elaborate on how your findings compare to the results by Liu et al (2023) and Gao et al (2023)? From the Related work part in Sec. 1, I understand you are claiming that the geometry with spherical constraints is different compared to that with weight-decay. Is this the case? If so, I believe it would be useful/interesting to elaborate on the differences. 

Also wondering if you have thoughts on this: Is the use of spherical constraints more of a mathematical convenience to arrive at a more "clean" NC geometry description OR is the claim that this is a practice actually preferred over weight decay?

Thm 3.3 last statement: Is cross-polytope the only solution?

minor: "The following result shows that the requirement in the Theorem 3.5 that k is not a rattler is satisfied
in many cases"  I would say "d=2" and "K<=d+1" is *some* cases 

I recommend ploting GCN1 in log scale

Can you elaborate on the numerical optimization of Softmax Code?

Computing \rho_{one-vs-rest} looks computationally expensive for large k (solving k quadratic programs). Can you please comment on that?

In addition to GNC2 metric, is it not possible to track a metric that more accurately captures the geometry? Eg. angles between classifiers. At least for cases that you know the geometry of Ws like K<2d?

The last subfigure in Fig 2 shows that generalization performance improves with decreasing temperature. Could you please comment on whether the best value achieved is also on par with the sota value for CE training without normalization and temperature scaling (which I believe is the "standard" practice?)

PS: In general, I enjoyed reading the paper and the results. I am inclined to increase my score to an 8 after the rebuttal.
