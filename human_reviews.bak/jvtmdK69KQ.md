# Statistical Perspective of Top-K Sparse Softmax Gating Mixture of Experts

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Top-K sparse softmax gating mixture of experts has been widely used for scaling up massive deep-learning architectures without increasing the computational cost. Despite its popularity in real-world applications, the theoretical understanding of that gating function has remained an open problem. The main challenge comes from the structure of the top-K sparse softmax gating function, which partitions the input space into multiple regions with distinct behaviors. By focusing on a Gaussian mixture of experts, we establish theoretical results on the effects of the top-K sparse softmax gating function on both density and parameter estimations. Our results hinge upon defining novel loss functions among parameters to capture different behaviors of the input regions. When the true number of experts $k_{\ast}$ is known, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of density and parameter estimations are both parametric on the sample size. However, when $k_{\ast}$ becomes unknown and the true model is over-specified by a Gaussian mixture of $k$ experts where $k > k_{\ast}$, our findings suggest that the number of experts selected from the top-K sparse softmax gating function must exceed the total cardinality of a certain number of Voronoi cells associated with the true parameters to guarantee the convergence of the density estimation. Moreover, while the density estimation rate remains parametric under this setting, the parameter estimation rates become substantially slow due to an intrinsic interaction between the softmax gating and expert functions.

### Summary
This paper analyzes Top-K sparse softmax gating mixture of experts. In particular, they focus on Gaussian mixture of experts and present theoretical results on the effect of MoE on density and parameter estimations.

### Strengths
* Analysis of MoE is a highly relevant and impactful direction of research.
* The analysis seems thorough and rigorous at a high level and the presented results are interesting.

### Weaknesses
* The paper is quite dense, and it would have been helpful to outline high level ideas before delving into notation-heavy math.
* Chen et al. [1] also analyze MoE, but in the deep learning setting. How does the analysis presented here differ from this work?

### Summary
The paper provides theoretical analysis on the convergence properties of sparse softmax gating mixtures of Gaussian experts. The key contributions are proving convergence rates in two cases - when the number of experts is exactly-specified, and when there is an overspecified number of experts. 

For the exact-specified case, the authors show a convergence rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$ to the true parameters under maximum likelihood estimation. This is an important theoretical result as it quantifies the sample complexity.

For the overspecified case, the convergence rate depends on the cardinality of the Voronoi cells induced by the gate activations

### Strengths
- The theoretical analysis of convergence rates for MoE models is novel and useful. Understanding sample complexity of different MoE architectures is valuable.
- The paper is technically strong, with detailed proofs of the main results. The analysis for the overspecified case considering Voronoi cells is creative.
- The assumptions are clearly laid out, making the results easy to interpret and apply.

### Weaknesses
- As noted, the paper is quite dense with heavy notation. More intuition and examples earlier on could make it more accessible.
- The writing in the universal assumptions section is unclear, and should be revised for readability.
- The implications of the theory for practitioners could be expanded on more in the discussion. Guidance on model design is lacking.

### Questions
- How do these convergence results compare to prior analysis on softmax vs sparse gating? Does this theory suggest one gating approach over the other?
- Due to the instability of the EM algorithm, there is no error bar provided in Figure 3b. Can we still consider this experiment to be reliable to to justify the theoretical results?
