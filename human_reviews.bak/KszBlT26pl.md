## Abstract
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a compelling technique for revealing the rationale underlying the behavior of autonomous agents. IRL seeks to estimate the unknown reward function of a Markov decision process (MDP) from observed agent trajectories. While most IRL approaches require the transition function to be prescribed or learned a-priori, we present a new IRL method targeting the class MDPs that follow the It\^{o} dynamics without this requirement. Instead, the transition is inferred in a physics-constrained manner simultaneously with the reward functions from observed trajectories leveraging the mean-field theory described by the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We conjecture an isomorphism between the time-discrete FP and MDP that extends beyond the minimization of free energy (in FP) and maximization of the reward (in MDP). This isomorphism allows us to infer the potential function in FP using variational system identification, which consequently allows the evaluation of reward, transition, and policy by leveraging the conjecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP-IRL by applying it to synthetic benchmarks and a biological problem of cancer cell dynamics, where the transition function is unknown.

### Summary
The paper proposed to combine physics based dynamics modelling with inverse reinforcement learning. Particularly they consider the class of systems governed by Fokker-Planck equations and derive a IRL method that is computationally efficient. The empirical experiments demonstrate the strength of method on a cancer cell dynamics problem.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a computationally efficient IRL algorithm by leveraging the following properties in FP-dynamics: a. the potential of the system is the negated value function b. The steady state visitation of optimal policy in FP dynamics has a closed form solution in an analytical form of potential function. c. IRL is easy now as given steady state distribution → we can figure out optimal value function and given optimal value function we can extract the reward function.
2. The authors propose to use Hermite cubic functions to induce structure in the potential functions/Q-function that maps state-actions to scalar.
3. Two experiments - 1 on a 2D toy domain and other on a dataset for cancer-cell dynamics show that FP-IRL can recover reward functions and optimal policies well.

### Weaknesses
1. I have strong concerns against the motivations in the paper:
    1. “Most IRL methods require the transition function to be known”: This is repeatedly claimed in the paper and is considered as the motivation behind this paper. This is not true as a number of works propose sample-based estimators to solve IRL [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. These methods should be discussed and compared against.
    2. “Empirical treatment of dynamics using NN’s is not generalizable”: While this statement is true, the way this problem is addressed is not by FP but by using Hermite cubic functions since FP also requires estimating the potential function which has the same learning complexity under a expressible function class. How do other prior methods compare if you use the Hermite cubic function as limited hypothesis class.
    3. “This means that the agent employs to reach states whose value function is high”: This is not a true statement as some high value states can be unreachable under a given starting state distribution. A better explanation for the conjecture might be needed. 
2. Novelty: I believe the core strength of paper is in combining FP-dynamics with IRL, merging existing theoretical components. But this combination is not well investigated empirically, experiments are performed on low-dimensional single domain.
3. Empirical evaluation: It is surprising that no baselines were compared against. There are a number of existing IRL baselines[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] that need to be compared in order to make the claims of the paper stand. The function class of Hermite cubic functions should be ablated in these comparisons as well.

### Summary
This paper introduces an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method that estimates the unknown reward function of a Markov decision process (MDP) without knowing the predefined transition function. Assuming the MDP follows an Ito dynamics, the method infers transitions and reward functions simultaneously from observed trajectories, leveraging mean-field theory through the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. The authors postulate an isomorphism between time-discrete FP and MDP, which plays the central role in the algorithm design.

### Strengths
The strengths of this paper seem unclear as it hinges on a potentially problematic conjecture.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper hinges on a conjecture, which might be problematic. This conjecture says that the $\psi$ is equivalent to the $Q$ function in RL problem. However, this $\psi$ function is related to the dynamics. In particular, $\nabla \psi$ is the gradient field. It seems unclear to me why the conjecture is true because the $Q$ function depends on the choice of reward function as well. 

It is possible that the authors actually assume that the equivalence is between the (entropy-regularized) optimal policy and the (entropy-regularized) optimal Q function. In this case, it is still unclear to me why the conjecture should be true. It would be great if the authors could at least prove it in special cases such as linear-quadratic case. 

2. For discrete-time MDPs, there are existing works that study max-entropy IRL without knowing the transition function. In fact, not knowing the reward seems not a barrier -- we can just estimate the transition from the trajectory data. Thus, the claim that "While most IRL approaches require the transition function to be prescribed or learned a-priori, we present a new IRL method targeting the class MDPs that follow the It^{o} dynamics without this requirement. " seems ungrounded. Moreover, it seems unclear to me why Ito dynamics should be used here. 

3. Related work. This work is also related to the huge literature on solving inverse problems involving PDEs, for example, neural ODE and PINN.

### Questions
1. Can you prove the conjecture on some toy cases?

### Summary
The manuscript presents a novel method for Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) using a physics-based prior. In essence, the proposed method makes the assumption that underlying dynamics when following the expert policy (induced by the demonstrations) follow Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. With this the authors are able to learn jointly the dynamics and the policy in an elegant way, and perform IRL in systems where the dynamics are not known.

### Strengths
- Very cool idea. I really liked it. It is elegant, but although complicated math are involved, I can say that the method itself is simple.
- Well-written paper; although the paper deals with non-trivial and non-popular (in ML) quantities, the authors have made a quite good job in effectively conveying their message.
- Long and interesting discussion section
- Detailed limitations of the method mentioned

### Weaknesses
- The evaluation/experiments is quite "weak". There are no baselines and no comparison to state of the art. It is important to know where the new method stands in terms of performance against other state of the art methods with no physics priors.
- No timings are provided for the experiments. Although I tend to agree with the statement "FP-IRL avoids such iterations altogether and instead induces a regression problem leveraging the FP physics that is also computationally more stable", wall-time performance can have very different outcomes (e.g. training the model in the proposed method takes too long).
- More details about the VSI method (in the main text) could help an ML-oriented reader

### Questions
- Can you provide some baselines of state of the art methods with no physics priors?
- Can you provide timings of the proposed method?

### Summary
The authors draw an interesting parallel between the Markov decision process (MDP) model commonly used in RL and the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE) used in modeling physical & biological systems. More specifically, the authors hypothesize equivalence between the $Q$ function in the MDP model and the (negative) potential function $\psi$ in the FP-PDE. This equivalence implies that methods that can be used to learn the potential are valid as IRL methods, using the inverse Bellman equation (IQ-Learn [1]). In this work, the potential is learned using variational system identification (VSI). VSI uses a parameterization scheme where the potential is a product of learnable parameters and features expressed using Hermite cubic functions.The learning occurs through minimization of the magnitude of the FP-PDE functional (since we want the FP-PDE function = 0 eventually). Overall, the established connection is interesting, but the use of VSI is limiting, which is reflected in the experiments.

### Strengths
It is known from [2] that the solution of FP-PDE has a Gibbs-Boltzmann density, and in many RL/IRL settings, a Boltzmann policy is assumed, therefore the connection between $\psi$ and $Q$ is easy to grasp. This reveals an intuitive connection to physical phenomena, which is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. Not broadly applicable to more challenging problems, since discretization is required. As the state-action space increases, the approach would become infeasible. 
2. No comparison with other IRL methods was provided. For example, is there an advantage to using VSI for the cancer cell problem, over other simple IRL methods?

### Questions
1. Page 5: "It imposes a physics constraint that the change in distribution should be small and approach zero over an infinitesimal time step". In the limit $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, the free energy term should become negligible in Equation 9, right? Why can we then ignore the squared Wasserstein distance term instead of the free energy term? 
2. Is VSI parameterization as good as a neural network parameterization, in terms of being able to learn the true function arbitrarily closely?
3. Does Equation 21 have a unique minimizer? If not, how does VSI address the unidentifiability/ill-posedness issue in IRL, i.e. there are many possible rewards (and corresponding value functions) that yield the same policy?
4. (Suggestion) Certain concepts could be introduced more better, through simple examples either in the main text or in the appendix. For example, intution behind FP-PDE - Equation 7, why Wiener processes are used, etc.
