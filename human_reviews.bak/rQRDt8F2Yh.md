# A Discrete and Variational Approach to Speech Representation Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 8, 3, 8

## Abstract
Previous work on self-supervised speech representation learning has taken diverse forms. However, it is plausible if there exists a learning objective that connects, or even generalizes across, distinct approaches. In this paper we propose a variational perspective that extends recent approaches, such as HuBERT, VQ-APC, and draws connections to VQ-CPC and wav2vec 2.0. We show that previous work can be formulated as a discrete latent variable model via predictive coding, and the proposed loss function provides an optimization advantage over other approaches. The learned representations through proposed approach obtain sizable improvements on phonetic classification, speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. Moreover, the variational principle not only provides a unification of approaches, but also a information theoretic lens for analyizing the learning of representations. We utilize the KL term and reconstruction term of the variational objective, also known as rate and distortion, to inspect the training dynamics. The outcome reveals that rather than the distortion, a model achieves superior downstream performance when the KL divergence between distinct signal components is minimized.

### Summary
The paper proposes a variational approximation of the speech representation learning problem that looks to generalize several previous works in the field and also provides advantages on the quality of the representation by imposing a direct relationship between the distribution of the latent representation given a known context (observed frames) and a variational distribution of the latent representation given the unknown context that must be reconstructed (masked or future frames).

The paper presents results on three standard downstream application tasks: Phone Classification, Speaker Verification, and Automatic Speech Recognition, and also evaluates the behavior of each component of the proposed ELBO, comparing it to the "equivalent" terms of HuBERT model. For the experimental phase, the paper uses simplified versions of previously proposed models used for comparison: wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT.

### Strengths
The proposed variational approximation tries to provide a better and principled formulation of the learning representation task, which contributes to a better understanding of the problem and presents a way to understand the relationships among the learning objectives of several of the existing solutions in the state-of-the-art. Moreover, it provides results that outperform simplified versions of two widely used models in the context of speech representation.

### Weaknesses
The formulation presented in the paper is not well-described; Figure 1b does not contribute to the understanding of the proposed approach and should be rebuilt entirely, and the learning process should also be explained in more detail. The use of simplified versions of benchmarking models limits the evidence of performance improvements presented in the paper.

### Questions
- How the proposed model guarantees the identifiability of distributions q(z_i|x_i) and p(z_i|x_\m) is unclear. Is the model train in fully unsupervised or (self-supervised) learning strategy or do the authors uses a force alligment to get the one-hot encoding vectors for all the experiments?

- The authors did not clarify their process to update the codebook; the whole learning process should be explained better. 

- The authors did not perform any experiment to evaluate the effect of the codebook size, which was arbitrarily set to 100. According to previous results using VQ strategies for speech representation, that is a too-small value.  

- Is there any reason that explains why the future prediction model outperforms the masked prediction training on speaker verification?

Minor things:

- The PER acronym is used before definition
-  There is an error in equiation (11) second row, las term should be p(z|x_A)

### Summary
This paper proposes a new interpretation of self-supervised learning algorithms such as wav2vec 2.0 and quantized CPC in which a transformation of one part of the data is used to predict a quantized version of another part of the data.  The new formulation focuses on the quantizer, rather than focusing on the predictor: it uses a variational lower bound in which the log probability of the masked data given the unmasked data is bounded by the log probability of reconstruction from the codebook, minus the KL divergence between the quantizer distribution and the predictor distribution.

### Strengths
The theoretical argument is quite interesting.  The original wav2vec 1.0 paper included all of the components of the proposed approach, but in that paper, the codebook entropy was presented as sort of an ad-hoc method of avoiding mode collapse.  The KL divergence (information rate) suggested in this paper is a more principled way of understanding what wav2vec 2.0 is really calculating.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical argument is interesting, but the experiments are quite weak.  HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 are crippled, and then the new representation is shown to outperform them.  Crippling the baselines might be forgivable if the crippling was irrelevant to the theoretical claims, but it is not.  HuBERT is crippled by not retraining the K-means codebook every few epochs, and wav2vec by removing the codebook entropy loss; these are directly relevant to the theoretical claims, and cause the experimental tests to be insufficient proof of the theoretical claims.

Against recommendations in the original HuBERT paper, this paper does not re-train HuBERT's codebook between epochs of transformer training. Figure 2 then shows that the proposed method achieves superior performance because it adapts the quantizer representation in a series of modes, which HuBERT cannot do because the authors chose not to allow it.  Indeed, re-training the K-means codebook in the manner recommended in the original HuBERT article would probably lead to a similar learning curve to VLB.

"As opposed to previous work in advocating codebook usage" -- The wording of this paragraph suggests that wav2vec increases a quantity while you decrease the same quantity, which is not true.  Your formulation measures D(q||p); diversity loss measures H(q).  Indeed, this is where the choice to remove H(q) from your wav2vec implementation is particularly troubling.  Wav2vec minimizes -H(q)-Eq[logp(z)], which is exactly D(q||p).  In other words, if you add back the entropy loss, wav2vec is already minimizing exactly the quantity proposed in this paper, and there should be no difference in performance between wav2vec and VLB.

Compared to those, this is a relatively minor point: One of the differences between future prediction and masked prediction is that, using future prediction, it's possible for each frame to serve two roles: to be predicted by its predecessor frames, while it is also a predictor of future frames.  Eq. (2) trivializes this by saying that the sum of all prediction log probabilities is less than or equal to the log probability of predicting the rest of the sequence from the first k frames.

There are a large number of grammar mistakes that.  Some of them, slowed my understanding of the paper somewhat: notable among these include the strange wording in the second line of the abstract, and the notational error in the second line of the equation in Appendix A.

### Questions
1. If you permit HuBERT to re-train its K-means codebook once every few epochs, does the resulting rate/distortion curve resemble the rate distortion curve of VLB?  What are the similarities and differences, and why?

2. If you permit wav2vec 2.0 to have its codebook entropy term, then is the resulting training criterion identical to VLB?  If not, why not?

### Summary
This paper proposes a variational learning framework for self-supervised learning. The authors studied the links between their framework and a few popular self-supervised learning approaches. More specifically, the authors show VQ-APC and HuBERT are all instances of the general framework they proposed. 

The authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the advantage of their variational lower bound objective in terms of optimization. They observed sizable improvement in their experiments in phone classification, speaker verification and ASR. The authors also conduct analysis on the connection between learning dynamics and downstream ASR performance.

### Strengths
This is a very interesting work which may motivate a new angle for self-supervised learning. There are a couple of advantages:

1. This is the first work I’m aware of that tries to connect a few different self-supervised learning objectives and try to unify them under the same umbrella. Better understanding the connections of existing approaches, their connections, Pros and Cons are important. 

2. The proposed VLB has benefits in terms of optimization. 

3. The proposed approach provides an information theoretic len for analysis. Specifically, the authors analyzed the learning dynamics vs ASR performance which is motivated by the theoretical foundations laid out in Alemi et al. (2018) and Prokhorov et al. (2019).

4. The proposed approach achieves, if not state of the art, but sizable improvement on the baselines they have set up, which supports their claim on the optimization benefits.

### Weaknesses
I would not say these are really weak points, but may be bullet points the authors may pay attention to.

1. I think this is a very nice work, but maybe it is only 95% done presumably due to the ICLR submission deadline. I saw small typos at places. To name a few, in table 1, params should not be LS960, Sometimes, VLB was written as VLM, and some very minor writing typos.

2. The authors demonstrated the connection between their approach and VQ-APC and many more methods, but they only compared tow wav2vec2 and HuBERT. Also, the authors mostly only test one WSJ. To make the claim stronger, does it make sense to compare to more methods you have mentioned and tested on more downstream datasets?

3. Compared with wav2vec-2 and HuBERT, does the proposed framework have advantages or disadvantages in terms of GPU hours? This analysis could be interesting as the authors are proposing a general framework.

### Questions
1. In Table one and two, VLB-base archives even more significant improvement. Does this sound reasonable? My understanding is that, Table one and two are strong evidences on the optimization benefits of the variational framework; However, the baseline can be stronger with more tuning, better initialization, optimizer scheduler, and even more data; That is, the gap between the Hubert/wav2vec-2 and VLB in could much smaller than what is shown in this draft. 

2. In Table three, are the rate and distortion calculated on dev93, eval92 or training data? Similar question to figure 2, is the PER curve on dev93 or eval92, or train?

### Summary
This paper proposed a new framework to unify causal and non-causal objective under a variational framework. Experimental results shows it's outperform Hubert and ablation also compared k-mean and on-the-fly learned codebook for the proposed VLB.

### Strengths
Unify causal and non-causal objective is a fundamental and important problem for audio representation.

### Weaknesses
(1) There are some analogy and connection to other model make no sense. For example, "The loss function becomes cross entropy if D contains all possible codes in V , and each code is uniquely sample", this is simply the difference of softmax and contrastive learning, I don't know what this rephrase means. I cannot see the proposed loss generalize anything to contrastive based approach.

(2) Based on (1), the proposed method is more like a unified version of w2v-bert [1] and best-rq [2], both of them using a mlm loss and learn the code on-the-fly without k-means.

(3) Experimental results are weak. No causal baseline been compared. 

(4) The paper is unify causal (predictive) and non-causal (mask based), but none of such unification work been mentioned in the paper. Can the author survey and add it?

[2] Self-Supervised Learning with Random-Projection Quantizer for Speech Recognition

### Questions
Can the author explain more on the difference of proposed approach versus VQ-CPC?  Am I right conceptually it's replacing contrastive predictive coding with mlm loss?

### Summary
The authors present an innovative approach to self-supervised speech representation learning by adopting a variational perspective that unifies existing disparate methods under a predictive coding framework. By using a speech encoder that predicts certain data partitions from others, the system is able to learn predictive knowledge from the signal's context. This includes elements like phonetic details or speaker identity. The novelty lies in their proposition of a variational lower bound (VLB) on the log-likelihood for predicting context from input partitions, framing this process as a generative model with discrete latent variables.

This variational approach eliminates the need for an additional clustering step found in previous methods and provides a more efficient optimization strategy.

### Strengths
The strength of paper is that the method is not only aligned with but also extends the reach of other self supervised representation methods. Importantly, their VLB can draw parallels with contrastive objectives that aim to maximize mutual information.
Additionally, the authors explore the learning process through an information-theoretic lens, examining the interplay between KL loss (rate) and reconstruction loss (distortion) during training. They find that effective learning occurs in stages where these terms are balanced to achieve a stable latent distribution, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks when the KL divergence between disjoint contexts is minimized.

### Weaknesses
The authors should have more discussion and conclusion around those speaker verification downstream task, and discuss about why MLM-VLB performs better for phone recognition while causal-VLB performs better for speaker verification. More simulation and visualization of learned feature representations for an example sentence and compare it with other VQ based method would be beneficial and add more values to the work.

### Questions
The written English can be improved. There are few typos in different part of paper,  e.g. variey instead of variety in 2nd page.
Please revise and fix the problems.
