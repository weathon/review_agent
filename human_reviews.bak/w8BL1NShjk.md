- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
We study the problem of learning universal features from multiple graphs through self-supervision. Graph self-supervised learning has been shown to facilitate representation learning, and produce competitive models compared to supervised baselines. However, existing methods of self-supervision learn features from one graph, and thus, produce models that are specialized to a particular graph. We hypothesize that leveraging multiple graphs of a family can improve the quality of learnt representations in the model by extracting features that are universal to the family of graphs. To achieve this, we propose a framework that can learn generalisable representations from disparate node features of different graphs. We first homogenise the disparate features with graph-specific modules, which feed into a universal representation learning module for generalisable feature learning. We show that leveraging multiple graphs of the same family improves the quality of representations and results in better performance on downstream node classification task compared to self-supervision with one graph. In this paper, we present a principled way to design foundation graph models that are capable of learning from a set of graphs in a holistic manner. This approach  bridges the gap between self-supervised and supervised performance, while reducing the computational time for self-supervision and parameters of the model.

### Summary
This work studies a framework for learning universal representations from multiple graphs through self-supervision, for node classification tasks. The proposed framework consists of graph-specific encoders that homogenize the distinct node features with different sizes and the universal encode that learns generic features from the homogenized features across different graphs. The framework is evaluated on node classification tasks with benchmark citation graphs, and the authors show the performance and efficiency improvements of the proposed method (namely U-SSL) over the self-supervised learning on individual graphs.

### Strengths
* This paper addresses the important and novel problem of learning universal representations across different graphs for node classification tasks.
* The proposed framework, consisting of graph-specific and universal encoders, is intuitive and easy to understand/implement. 
* This paper is generally well-written.

### Weaknesses
There are some weaknesses in the experimental setups and results, as follows:
* The authors consider only the citation graphs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed universal representation learning framework. In this vein, the proposed method may not be generalizable to more complex networks, such as social networks or code graphs.
* For the citation graphs that are mainly considered in this paper, the authors may not have to use graph-specific encoders to homogenize the features from different graphs. In particular, for citation graphs, we can use the abstract of each paper to generate initial node features, and subsequently we can use the shared vocabulary or a certain method that can encode abstracts in a unified manner (e.g., using LMs to embed them), which means the proposed graph-specific encoders may not be worthwhile to use.
* In Table 1 and Table 2, if the performances of the proposed U-SSL are lower than the performances of the baseline full fine-tuning methods, while these baselines are more efficient than the proposed U-SSL, what are the advantages that we can grab from using the proposed U-SSL?

Also, there is a weakness in the generability of the proposed method, as follows:
* The proposed method seems applicable to only the graphs with features, while real-world graphs sometimes do not have initial node features.

### Questions
* Do you use the same backbone model for baseline, SSL, and U-SSL methods?
* When reporting the main results (Table 1), I am wondering why not include the OGBN-arxiv dataset during pre-training, and rather show the results with pre-training on all datasets including the OGBN-arxiv dataset as the extra. I assume that if similar citation networks are used more during pre-training of the proposed U-SSL, the downstream performance may be further increased.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel concept and explores a new problem domain - Universal self-supervised learning on graphs. In the case of other modalities such as images and natural language, models pre-trained on large datasets tend to generalize well to other datasets. However, achieving similar generalizations for graph data is notoriously challenging. This paper aims to address this challenge through universal self-supervisions, which involve training an Encoder model on various datasets and pretext tasks to obtain universal embeddings. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between self-supervised and supervised performance.

### Strengths
- The research problem is intriguing and holds practical significance.
- The authors provide a comprehensive definition of the concepts used in this paper, such as 'universal self-supervision'.
- The proposed framework is straightforward and easy to comprehend.

### Weaknesses
- Concerns about graph-specific encoders: Regarding the alignment of feature dimensions across different graph datasets using a graph-specific encoder, it raises the question of how the proposed method generalizes to new, unseen datasets when there is no learned graph-specific encoder available. Since the aim of this paper is to learn universal node embeddings, it would be interesting to explore how the approach adapts to new datasets where a graph-specific encoder has not been learned.

**Concerns about the experiments**:
 
- The experimental setup used in this paper appears to be unconventional. Firstly, the authors explicitly choose NAGhormer as the encoder, which avoids direct comparisons with traditional self-supervised methods based on message-passing GNNs. However, NAGhormer does not seem to be the primary contribution of this paper. I recommend that the authors consider conducting experiments with a GCN-based encoder and compare their approach with standard graph-specific self-supervised models, such as contrastive methods.
- Furthermore, in the experimental section, the authors claim to use PairSim as a self-supervised task. While I am well-acquainted with self-supervised learning on graphs, such as contrastive methods and graph autoencoders, I am not familiar with PairSim. It is crucial that the authors provide a detailed explanation of the self-supervised task they use, preferably in the form of an objective function. They should also clarify why they chose this particular task, and if a different task (such as contrastive learning) were adopted, what impact it would have on the experimental results.
- Lastly, the experimental results provided by the authors are not particularly convincing. The results in Table 1 appear to be rather perplexing, as the authors did not clarify the dataset splits, which, to my knowledge, do not align with the common splits used for the corresponding baselines. Furthermore, the authors claim that their proposed method narrows the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised models, but the experimental results do not seem to support this claim. I would suggest that the authors reconsider conducting experiments under more widely adopted self-supervised settings, such as those used in contrastive learning and masked graph autoencoder methods.

### Summary
The paper proposes to learn universal feature representations to facilitate cross-graph self-supervised learning. The model consists of two modules: the graph-specific module projects node features of different graphs to the same space; and then the universal representation learning module gets the features as input and share parameters for graph learning. The authors claim it can be a good way to train foundation graph models.

### Strengths
(1) The paper presents a very simple concept which tends to contribute more on the engineering side but useful in practice.
(2) The writing and organization is generally clear.
(3)  Comparatively comprehensive experiments on efficacy, efficiency and scalability

### Weaknesses
1. The major concern is about the novelty. The method is too straightforward and we do not see enough insights here. 
2. There are some ambiguity about the setting of universal multi-graph SSL. For the pre-training tasks on molecule graphs such as Rong et al. (2020), they are also training on multiple graphs. However the paper actually differs from these papers since it implicitly assumes that the have graphs with node attributes from different domains or with different dimensions. It is generally suitable for those big graphs with node-level/edge-level downstream tasks. But the authors do not make this point very clear.
3. In the experiments, the choice of the self-supervision task in our study is guided by the downstream task. That also looks too heuristic or too specific, because in many cases pretraining is used to train a foundation model which can be generalizable to many different tasks.

### Summary
The manuscript proposes a generic framework designed for universal representation learning on graphs with different input features. By leveraging multiple graphs of a family, the proposed method can improve the quality of
learned representations, similar to multi-task learning. Experiments show that the method outperforms traditional SSL counterparts and obtains comparable results with supervised learning on some datasets.

### Strengths
1. Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The paper studies an interesting research question of how to utilize knowledge contained in different graphs. As we know, graph datasets usually come with different node/edge features, which significantly hinders the study of transfer learning and foundation models. The authors adopt a simple approach to map the raw features from different domains into one shared feature space, and then train a shared graph encoder on top of the universal space. The pipeline makes sense to me and shows some promising results.
3. The framework seems to show some transferability. For example, when trained on [CoraFull, Cora-ML, DBLP, Citeseer, PubMed] and adapted on Arxiv, the result is better than performing SSL only on Arxiv itself. This demonstrates that training a shared graph encoder given a universal feature space can indeed help transfer learning.
4. In section 8.5, the authors show that including graphs with a larger domain gap negatively affects the quality of the universal embeddings. This finding is consistent with my understanding and it'll be better if the authors conduct more experiments to further demonstrate it.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors only implement the framework with one specific graph encoder, i.e., NAGphormer. The results will be much more convincing with more backbones included.
2. Similarly, they only use one pretext objective for SSL and test with one downstream task, i.e., SSNC. 
3. The experiments lack details, and no code is available.

### Questions
1. What's the data split used in the experiments? I looked everywhere but found nothing. The results for node classification seem weird to me, e.g., even a simple 2-layer GCN can achieve over 70% accuracy on Arxiv, yet the supervised baseline in the manuscript is only 61%. The authors must explain the gap between the results reported in the manuscript and the ones commonly found in related literature.
2. How to do the self-supervised learning (PairSim)? How to define the 'similar' or 'dissimilar' nodes without label information? Please add the equation of the training objective to the revised version.
3. The results in Table 1 are strange. In conventional graph-ssl literature, e.g., DGI[1], the performance of supervised GCN and SSL variants is close. However, in Table 1, there is a significant gap between the supervised baseline and SSL methods for some datasets. 
4. Why add an additional data augmentation step before feeding into the linear layers? The authors should conduct an ablation study to show the effect of such graph-aware augmentation. 
5. If the authors want to claim transferability (so-called Adaptability in the manuscript) of their framework, more experimental results and analysis should be included. Only the result on Arxiv is not convincing enough.
Overall, this paper is interesting in its research question, and the overall framework also makes sense to me. However, many technical details are missing and reproducibility is limited.
