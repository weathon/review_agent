- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 6

## Abstract
Non-asymptotic convergence analysis of quasi-Newton methods has gained attention with a landmark result establishing an explicit local superlinear rate of $\mathcal{O}((1/\sqrt{t})^t)$. The methods that obtain this rate, however, exhibit a well-known drawback: they require the storage of the previous Hessian approximation matrix or instead storing all past curvature information to form the current Hessian inverse approximation. Limited-memory variants of quasi-Newton methods such as the celebrated L-BFGS alleviate this issue by leveraging a limited window of past curvature information to construct the Hessian inverse approximation. As a result, their per iteration complexity and storage requirement is $\mathcal{O}(\tau d)$ where $\tau \le d$ is the size of the window and $d$ is the problem dimension reducing the $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ computational cost and memory requirement of standard quasi-Newton methods. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no result showing a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate for any limited-memory quasi-Newton method. In this work, we close this gap by presenting a Limited-memory Greedy BFGS (LG-BFGS) method that can achieve an explicit non-asymptotic superlinear rate. We incorporate displacement aggregation, i.e., decorrelating projection, in post-processing gradient variations, together with a basis vector selection scheme on variable variations, which $\textit{greedily}$ maximizes a progress measure of the Hessian estimate to the true Hessian. Their combination allows past curvature information to remain in a sparse subspace while yielding a valid representation of the full history. Interestingly, our established $\textit{non-asymptotic}$ superlinear convergence rate demonstrates an explicit trade-off between the convergence speed and memory requirement, which to our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposed a variant of limited-memory BFGS method by incorporating the techniques of greedy updates (Rodomanov and Nesterov 2021a) and the strategy of dynamically selecting the curvature pairs (Berahas 2022a). The convergence analysis show that the proposed methods can achieve explicit local superlinear rates.

### Strengths
This paper studies a historical open problem for limited memory quasi-Newton methods: can limited mememory quasi-Newton methods achieve explicit local superlinear rates or better linear rates than the first-order methods. The incorporation of selecting curvature pairs and the greedy quasi-Newton methods is interesting. The results could be super exiciting to the community if they are correct.

### Weaknesses
The authors define condition number on the error matrix $\hat{B}\_t-\nabla^2 f(x\_{t+1})$ and suppose it can be bounded. This is a very strong and impractical assumption. During the optimizing process, some eigenvalues of $\hat{B}\_t-\nabla^2 f(x\_{t+1})$ could be $0$, which makes the condition number unable to be bounded (i.e. for the greedy quasi-Newton methods (Rodomanov and Nesterov 2021a), which is the full memory version of the proposed methods, we have $\hat{B}_t\to\nabla^2 f(x^*)$ ).

The author provide the bound on the condition $\beta_t$ in Appendix F, which results an linear rate instead of the superlinear rate, however $e^{-Ct}\approx (1-C)^t$ where $C=q^{t_0+1}\mu/(C_\beta dL)\ll 1/\kappa$. Such rate is even worse than the linear rate of gradient descent which cannot be claimed as an "improved linear rate''.

Given upon this, I think "close the gap of showing non-asymptotic superlinear rate of limited memory quasi-Newton methods'' in the abstract is overclaimed.

### Summary
This paper proposes and analyzes LG-BFGS, a greedy version of the celebrated
L-BFGS quasi-Newton method. The modifications are two-fold: (i) greedy selection 
of the parameter difference vector $s_t$ from a truncated basis, and (ii) a 
so-called _displacement step_ which re-wights the curvature pair history to 
capture new information rather than simply replacing the oldest pair with the 
new one. The authors leverage these modifications to prove a local super-linear
convergence rate for LG-BFGS; this rate is particularly nice in that it
improves with the size of the history.
The paper concludes with experimental comparison of LG-BFGS, Greedy BFGS,
and other related methods.

### Strengths
The major strength of this paper is the convergence analysis for LG-BFGS,
which shows a super-linear rate and is sensitive enough to improve with the size
of the history $\tau$. This is a strong achievement given the long history
of interesting in limited-memory quasi-Newton methods.

Other notable strengths include:

- The LG-BFGS method represents a novel synthesis of ideas from the
    quasi-Newton literature, combining greedy basis selection with careful
    updates to the history.

- LG-BFGS has fast per-iteration convergence (locally) in practice,
    particularly when compared with the standard L-BFGS method. 

- The text is polished and contains very few typos. 

Note that I did not check the proofs for correctness.

### Weaknesses
I have several concerns with this work. 

- The version of LG-BFGS which has super-linear convergence uses a correction
    strategy that requires Hessian-vector products. The naive cost of these
    computations are $O(d^2)$, which would make LG-BFGS more expensive than
    Greedy BFGS in practice.  However, this computational cost is not addressed
    anywhere in the text. 

- Related to the previous point, the authors repeatedly miss-represent the 
    computational complexity of LG-BFGS as being comparable to L-BFGS, which it
    is formally not. 

- LG-BFGS even without the correction factor has a significant per-iteration 
    time cost and experiments in the appendix show that L-BFGS or G-BFGS 
    may be preferable in practice instead. 

- Moreover, the role of the correction strategy is not studied empirically
    despite the necessity of this trick for deriving convergence guarantees.
    Experimental results appear to be shown only for the algorithm without
    correction, which does not match the analysis in the paper. 

Given my concerns, I feel the submission is borderline. However, I am willing 
and would like to update my score if the authors can address these issues as
well as my questions below.

### Questions
- Curvature Pair Update: It seems $e_i$ stands for both a general basis and
    for the standard basis. This overloading of notation is awkward since $e_i$
    is typically a standard basis vector and becomes confusing in 
    Definition 1, where it's not obvious if $e_i$ now refers to the standard
    or general basis I suggest introducing a separate notation for the general
    basis and using $e_i$ only for the standard one.

- Remark 1: The computational cost is of a different order for L-BFGS and LG-BFGS:
    $O(\tau^2 d + \tau^4)$ vs $O(4 \tau d)$, so I would not say that they are comparable.
    If $\tau \leq 4$ is very small, then the are comparable, but not in an
    asymptotic sense.  Moreover, if you are going to use big-O notation, then
    the complexity of L-BFGS should be written as $O(\tau d)$ since the
    constant $4$ does not contribute to the asymptotic growth.
    The first comment also applies to the discussion in Section 5.

- Section 3.1: Computing $\phi_t$ requires a Hessian-vector product, right? 
    This should be $O(d^2)$, since $x_{t+1} - x_t$ doesn't have any special structure,
    unlike the Hessian-vector products with the variable variation $s_t$. 
    Why doesn't this contribute to the overall complexity of LG-BFGS as stated
    in Section 5?

- Proposition 3: What matrix is the minimal relative condition number defined
    with respect? Is it the same error matrix from Theorem 1? 
    I don't see that stated anywhere, if so.

- Equation 17: Under what conditions is this actually a contraction? My
    understanding is that $\tau < d$ implies the trace progress condition
    cannot converge to $d$ unless the Hessian is low-rank and spanned by $e_1,
    \ldots, e_\tau$. It would be nice to see some discussion of this fact.

- Comparison to BFGS: Do you think the slower rate of BFGS compared to G-BFGS 
    is an artifact of the analysis by Rodomanov and Nesterov, or is it because
    of the different update strategy used for the curvature matrix? 
    The per-iteration convergence of L-BFGS and LG-BFGS suggets it is the latter. 

- Experimental Comparison: It doesn't make sense to compare G-FBGS to LG-BFGS
    with any choice of $\tau$ as a linear function of $d$. In this setting, 
    LG-BFGS is asymptotically more expensive than G-BFGS and both thereotically and
    experimentally slower than G-BFGS. It only makes sense to use LG-BFGS when
    $\tau$ is an absolute constant or a slowly growing sub-linear function of
    $d$. For example, choosing $\tau \in \{5, 10, 25, 50\}$ would be 
    appropriate for MNIST and Protein, while somewhat smaller choices would be
    suitable for Connect-4.

- Appendix G: 

    - Do the experiments in the main paper ignore the correction strategy 
    and set $\tau r_t = r_t$, or this is only done in the appendix experiments?
    This seems important as computing the Hessian-vector product needed for the 
    correction is computationally expensive, but also apparently necessary
    for a theoretical convergence guarantee. I think it is important to 
    provide an ablation study comparing the performance of LG-BFGS with and 
    without the correction factor (in wall-clock time) so that its effects
    can be properly understood.

    - L-BFGS is much more competitive with LG-BFGS when convergence is shown
    in terms of wall-clock time (Figure 2 in the appendix). Indeed, even
    G-BFGS becomes competitive with LG-BFGS when measured in wall-clock time. 
    This worries me, since (i) the results are shown without the
    potentially expensive correction step needed for convergence guarantees;
    and (ii) L-BFGS is much simpler than LG-BFGS, so the relative merits of
    LG-BFGS are somewhat diminished.

### Summary
In this work, the authors focus on the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of quasi-Newton optimization methods. This study addresses the challenge of balancing computational complexity and memory requirements in such methods. While prior approaches demonstrated a local superlinear rate, they suffered from high memory demands due to the storage of past curvature information. Limited-memory variants, like the L-BFGS method, reduced these demands by utilizing a limited window of curvature information. However, prior to this work, there was no known limited-memory quasi-Newton method that could achieve non-asymptotic superlinear convergence. The authors introduce the Limited-memory Greedy BFGS (LG-BFGS) method, which incorporates techniques like displacement aggregation and basis vector selection to balance memory requirements while achieving a superlinear rate of convergence. This work reveals an explicit trade-off between convergence speed and memory usage, a novel contribution to the field. Numerical experiments support their theoretical findings, confirming the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths
* In this paper the authors provide a nonasymptotic local superlinear rate for the LG-BFGS method with affordable storage requirements.
* They establish an explicit trade-off between the memory size and the contraction factor that appears in the superlinear rate.
* The LG-BFGS method uses greedy basis vector selection for the variable variation and displacement aggregation on the
gradient variation.
* The authors provide an experimental comparison of the proposed method with gradient descent, L-BFGS, and greedy BFGS.
* From experiments one can observe that the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable with the greedy BFGS when the memory size is large.

### Weaknesses
* It would be advisable to present the contributions as bullet points to provide a clearer view.
* In Figure 1(a) the second LG-BFGS with $\tau = d/6$ is a lapsus right? Moreover, it will be helpful to change the color of the Full memory GD as it gets confused with LG-BFGS with $\tau = d/2$. 
* It would be beneficial to include a table outlining the convergence rate and computation complexity of the proposed method and other non-asymptotic methods.
* There is missing citations and work comparison with [1].
* The title of the paper may lead one to believe that the proposed method is applicable to Quasi-Newton methods, including SR1. However, upon reading the paper, it becomes clear that the authors only discuss BFGS. To avoid any ambiguity, it would be better to modify the title accordingly.
* The paper presents only theoretical proofs about the local convergence of the proposed method. However, it lacks discussion on how the method can achieve global convergence. On the other hand, in [2], the authors demonstrate both global and local convergence rates that make their method superior to the proposed one.

### Summary
The paper studies bounded memory second order approach. The main contribution is an algorithm, called greedy bounded memory BFGS, that obtains superlinear convergence in the non-asymptotic regime and has an explicit dependence on the memory. Experiments have been performed to verify the effectiveness of the approach.

Second order approaches like quasi newton approach obtain superlinear convergence rate (instead of linear convergence rate as gradient descent) for minimizing a $\mu$-strongly convex and $L$-second order smooth function. However, these approach typically requires quadratic memory ($d^2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the function) and relative large computation cost. The bounded memory BFGS is designed to save the memory, by storing a subset of past curvature (e.g. the last $\tau$ points and gradients). However, a major challenge in the literature is to derive superlinear convergence rate for bounded memory approach. This question is resolved in a recent paper by [Rodomanov and Nesterov 2021]. However, this result is in the asymptotic regime and no explicit dependence on the memory is shown.

The major contribution of this paper is to provide the convergence analysis in the non-asymptotic regime and the convergence rate derived has an explicity dependence on the memory. The convergence rate obtained is roughly: $(1 - \frac{\mu}{C_{\beta}dL})^{t(t+1)/2}(1-\frac{\mu}{2L})^{t_0}$ where $C_{\beta}$ is a parameter depends on the memory. 

The main idea of the paper is (1) a greedy selection procedure that selects the direction that maximizes the deduction of potential function; (2) a displacement aggregation that determines the curvature to store. As far as I understand, both ideas have appeared in the literature, but combining them is quite non-trivial.

I like the presentation of this paper, and I believe the non-asymptotic result is of broad interests to optimization and OR community. I incline to acceptance, though I have to say I am not an expert and perhaps miss its overlap between literature.

### Strengths
The result looks very nice.

### Weaknesses
The paper claims an explicity dependence on memory. This dependence is hidden in a parameter $C_{\beta}$, looking at its definition, I can understand its relationship with the memory. However, this relationship is still not that explicit because it is not an explicit function of the memory.
