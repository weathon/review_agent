- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Vectorized high-definition (HD) maps contain detailed information about surrounding road elements, which are crucial for various downstream tasks in modern autonomous vehicles, such as motion planning and vehicle control. Recent works have attempted to directly detect the vectorized HD map as a point set prediction task, resulting in significant improvements in detection performance. However, these methods fail to analyze and exploit the inner-instance correlations between predicted points, impeding further advancements. To address this issue, we investigate the utilization of inner-$\textbf{INS}$tance information for vectorized h$\textbf{IGH}$-definition mapping through $\textbf{T}$ransformers and introduce InsightMapper. This paper presents three novel designs within InsightMapper that leverage inner-instance information in distinct ways, including hybrid query generation, inner-instance query fusion, and inner-instance feature aggregation. Comparative experiments are conducted on the NuScenes dataset, showcasing the superiority of our proposed method. InsightMapper surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.78 mAP and 7.03 TOPO, which assess topology correctness. Simultaneously, InsightMapper maintains high efficiency during both training and inference phases, resulting in remarkable comprehensive performance.

### Summary
The paper presents a method to utilize inner-instance information for vectorized high-definition mapping, with the aim at improving the detection performance. The proposed method is called InsightMapper, which includes three designs to use inner-instance information. The hybrid query generation, inner-instance query fusion and inner-instance feature aggregation are proposed to construct the InsightMapper. The method is evaluated on the NuScenes and Argoverse datasets and compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
The inner-instance information and correlations are explored to improve the detection of the vectorized HD map.  

In the decoder part, hybrid query is generated to maintain appropriate inner-instance information exchange as compared to the normal and hierarchical query generation. 

Experimental analysis is conducted on two datasets and the results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the performance of the vectorized HD map detection.

### Weaknesses
The overall framework is constructed on top of the previous methods like BEVformer. The modification of the proposed InsightMapper framework is located in the transformer decoder for HD map detection. 

The proposed hybrid query generation method sounds like an incremental version of the normal query and the hierarchical query generation methods proposed in the MapTr paper. 

The ablation study of different proposed components is not included. It would be better to show the effect of the three proposed components in the whole framework for HD mapping.

### Questions
What is the reason for the performance drop when the self-attention applied before the cross-attention module in the inner-instance feature aggregation method?


How about the comparison with the recent HD mapping methods, such as InstaGraM [1] and Bi-Mapper [2]?

### Summary
The paper introduces InsightMapper, a novel model for vectorized high-definition (HD) mapping, crucial for various tasks in modern autonomous vehicles such as motion planning and vehicle control. InsightMapper is designed to exploit the inner-instance correlations between predicted points, addressing the shortcomings of previous methods that failed to analyze and utilize these correlations effectively. The authors propose three novel designs within InsightMapper: Hybrid Query Generation, Inner-Instance Query Fusion and Inner-Instance Feature Aggregation. InsightMapper is evaluated using the NuScenes dataset, where it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 5.78 mAP and 7.03 TOPO, showcasing its effectiveness in leveraging inner-instance information for improved performance in vectorized HD mapping. The model also maintains high efficiency during both training and inference phases, resulting in remarkable comprehensive performance.

### Strengths
- This work explores on the inner-instance feature interaction through mutiple modules, including inner-instance query fusion after initialized, and inner-instance point feature aggregation within the decoder layer.
- The main result is conducted on two datasets, where the performance improvement observed in InsightMapper is commendable.
- A comprehensive set of ablation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed design, showcasing its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors incorporate centerline perception into their task as a novel addition. During preprocessing, they deliberately omit centerlines within intersections that have degrees greater than two, aiming to simplify the learning of lane topology. However, this modification compromises the integrity and consistency of the topology, rendering the centerline results somewhat inconsequential. The visual representation of both the ground truth and prediction appears weird and lacks clarity.

2. The authors assert that "Usually, inter-instance correlation distracts the inner-instance information exchange, degrading the final performance". They also maintain that "self-attention before cross-attention should treat all queries equally to prevent duplicated predictions". However, there seems to be an inconsistency in these claims. The self-attention in decoder layers can also foster inter-instrance correlation, which is necessary for DETR-like detection paradigm. The assertions appear somewhat unsubstantiated, particularly when considering that eliminating the inter-instance mask in the inner-instance self-attention module results in a marginal decrease of -0.6% in mAP and -0.09% in TOPO. The notable contribution of the module, reflected in a +2.89% increase in mAP and 2.39 in TOPO, seems to be primarily due to the introduction of an additional attention layer and its strategic positioning, rather than the mitigation of distractions caused by inter-instance correlation.

3. The paper falls short in providing comprehensive implementation details, both regarding the proposed method and the re-training processes of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Critical information such as the input image resolution and the number of layers in both the encoder and decoder is omitted. This lack of transparency raises questions about the fairness and comparability among the evaluated methods.

4. The paper's novelty and contributions are moderate. The paper demonstrates a commendable performance gain, but it appears that this improvement predominantly stems from the addition of layers. While it presents new modules and findings, the mechanisms driving this enhancement are not elucidated clearly. The theoretical foundation and analysis presented in the paper seem to lack depth and solidity.

### Questions
1. In reference to the weakness 1, what is the essential rationale behind the modification? While it is noted that connectivity with intersections is not entirely eliminated, the remaining components appear to lack substantive meaning or relevance. Could you clarify the necessity of this adjustment in the context of your study’s objectives and outcomes?

2. Can you report the result of your model on the more popular benchmark with only 3 classes? So you can perform a fair comparision with the official results of MapTR, VectorMapNet, PivotNet etc..

3. In reference to the weakness 2, could you elucidate how the distraction caused by inter-instance correlation contributes to the degradation of the final performance? From my perspective, the effectiveness of the additional self-attention layer seems to originate from the enhancement of inner-instance feature aggregation rather than the blocking of inter-instance correlation (because the inter-instance correlation in self-attention layer is still exist). Could you provide further clarification on this aspect?

4. Could you clarify what is the difference between "Vanilla attention" and "No mask" in the Table 7? It seems the only difference that you have mentioned is the randomly mask in your inner-instance points. The gap between this two models seems huge (1.4 on mAP). Can you give a further explanation?

5. In reference to the weakness 3, could you furnish the more detailed information regarding the implementation? Considering the relatively low FPS reported, it appears that substantial modifications have been made to the original design of MapTR, as well as to other methods employed in the study.

6. Regarding different query generation schemes, can you specify which research utilizes the naive query generation pipeline? It has come to my attention that a recent work, PivotNet [1], seems to utilize a strategy similar to your query generation approach. Could you also provide comparison between the PivotNet?

7. Some minor issues:

   - In your third paragraph of introduction, PolyDiffuse (Chen et al., 2023) and TopoNet (Li et al., 2023b) are not segmentation-based mothed.

   - missing period in end of Section 3.1.

   - wrong quotation mark, ”blind.” in Section 4.3.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of vectorized high-definition mapping, which aims to reconstruct vectorized maps from onboard sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDARs). Building upon a previous Transformer-based method, MapTR, the authors study the attention designs of the Transformer decoder and propose three improvements based on empirical findings: i) assigning each point a unique point-level query embedding, ii) adding an additional self-attention layer before the Transformer decoder,  iii) adding additional self-attention layers inside the Transformer decoder, dedicated for intra-instance modeling. With these modifications, the proposed method, InsightMapper, improves MapTR on both nuScenes and Argoverse datasets. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results are provided.

### Strengths
- The paper provides a set of reasonable explorations on the query and attention designs for the HD mapping task. Since similar Transformer-based or DETR-based frameworks are general and can be applied to many different computer vision problems (e.g., geometry generation/reconstruction), the findings in this paper can also be helpful in other domains.

- The experiments are extensive and show good quantitative performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets. The supplementary doc also covers recent works like MapTR-v2, providing strong empirical results. 

- The supplementary video provides good qualitative comparisons;

### Weaknesses
This paper presents promising empirical results. However, my concern is that the method design lacks convincing explanations and insights, both theoretically and empirically. The reasonings in Sec.3 and Sec.4 are mostly subjective conjectures drawn from the experimental trials and errors, which could not accurately explain the failure of previous designs. Details are listed below:

(1). Ideally, with the hierarchical query design in MapTR, the self-attention layers of the Transformer decoder can also learn inter-instance and inner-instance message passing. This paper does not convincingly explain why the existing designs failed. Words alone are not persuasive enough, and I expect more detailed/principled analyses (e.g., showing the attention patterns between the points learned by MapTR and the proposed method). 

(2). Recent works like MapTR-v2 decompose the global self-attention layer into inter-instance and intra-instance self-attention, which reduces the memory and computational cost but *does not significantly improve the mAP*. This again makes the paper's reasonings/explanations unconvincing because MapTR-v2's intra-instance attention looks very similar to the proposed inner-instance self-attention -- is the difference in the order of the attention layers inside each decoder block? 

(3). I can not buy the arguments for the "hybrid query generation" and "hierarchical query generation" unless more in-depth analyses like the attention weights visualization are provided. Sharing the point-level query across instances is natural as the point embedding can encode the spatial affinity of points; for example, $q_2^P$ is spatially closer to $q_1^P$ than $q_{10}^P$, which applies to most polylines. The "hybrid query generation" and the "inner-instance query fusion" add additional modeling capacity and improve the quantitative results, but I cannot see clear insights on why these changes can make such huge differences.


Without convincing explanations, the contributions of this paper are limited to empirical trials and errors, and it may not further inspire future works in this area.

### Questions
Besides the concerns discussed in the weaknesses section, there are two minor questions:

- I appreciate that the evaluation protocol used in this paper considers the additional "centerline" class, which is more challenging than the conventional evaluation setting in previous works (e.g., VectorMapNet, MapTR, etc.). However, it is helpful to also provide the results on the old benchmark without the "centerline" class. There are two reasons: i) it can show if the proposed method works better when the tasks become more challenging by comparing the performance gap with and without centerlines; ii) numbers from previous papers can be directly compared in a table, making the results more consistent across different papers. 

- In Table 7, the difference between "Vanilla attention" and "No mask" is unclear. From the descriptions in Sec.4.4, it seems that the "attention without the mask" is equivalent to the "vanilla attention"?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed InsightMapper, which predicts online vectorized HD maps from multiview images. Compared with prior works, the authors proposed to leverage inner-instance information when predicting map objects: 1) hybrid query generation that consists of both instance-level and point (sub-instance) level queries without reusing the point-level queries 2) inner-instance query fusion that computes better point-level queries by weighted sum 3) inner-instance feature aggregation layer that limits the attention within each instance. The authors showed that the proposed method can yield better performance than the previous SOTA (MapTR) on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

### Strengths
- The paper is overall well written and easy to follow.
- The introduction and the related works sections summarized quite a complete set of recent HD map detection works.
- The key idea is simple and it makes sense. The authors do a good job of ablating the model to support the three designs.
- The proposed method achieves SOTA results on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. Numbers do not match those in MapTR. I am a bit confused as the numbers reported in Table 1 for the MapTR method seem not to match those reported in the original paper (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=k7p_YAO7yE). E.g. for MapTR 24 epoch R50 model, the mAP listed in Table 1 is 42.93, while in the original paper, the number is 50.3 (see Table 1 of the MapTR paper). I am not sure if I missed anything (is the training/evaluation setting different?), but I did not find anywhere in the paper explaining this difference.

2. Questions on inner-instance query fusion: in equation (3), the $w_{i,j,k}$ is not defined. How do you compute or obtain the weights? Are they just learnable weights?

3. Question about Table 7. What is the difference between "Vanilla attention" and "No mask"? If I understand correctly, the proposed inner-instance self-attention module is vanilla attention with a mask, and in this case, "Vanilla attention" and "No mask" should refer to the same module.

Minor:
- In the 11th row of the **HD Map Detection** paragraph of the related works section, the VectrorMapNet citation is wrong (it pointed to VectorNet).

### Questions
I am mostly concerned about the first issue in the weaknesses section, the improvement is no longer this significant compared with the original numbers from MapTR. And I am also concerned about the Q2 and Q3 for the clarity of the writing.

I have not directly worked on HDMap detection before, thus my judgment on the SOTA results and method novelty might not be accurate.
