- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Battery degradation remains a pivotal concern in the energy storage domain, with machine learning emerging as a potent tool to drive forward insights and solutions. However, this intersection of electrochemical science and machine learning poses complex challenges. Machine learning experts often grapple with the intricacies of battery science, while battery researchers face hurdles in adapting intricate models tailored to specific datasets. Beyond this, a cohesive standard for battery degradation modeling, inclusive of data formats and evaluative benchmarks, is conspicuously absent.  Recognizing these impediments, we present BatteryML—a one-step, all-encompass, and  open-source platform designed to unify data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of both traditional and state-of-the-art models. This streamlined approach promises to enhance the practicality and efficiency of research applications. BatteryML seeks to fill this void, fostering an environment where experts from diverse specializations can collaboratively contribute, thus elevating the collective understanding and advancement of battery research.

### Summary
This paper describes the current state of research in machine learning applied to battery degradation. The authors claim 3 challenges exist in current research:
1. Battery dataset are heterogenous in both their measurement techniques and data formats.
2. Feature extraction is difficult when applying ML techniques to battery data.
3. Adapting modern ML models to battery data cannot be done in a plug and play fashion.

To address these problems, the authors provide an open source platform called BatteryML which unifies datasets, provides tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction and visualization. They also define the primary battery degradation prediction metrics including State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Finally, they evaluate multiple models (linear, neural nets, and random forests) on the task of predicting RUL separately on 7 different datasets as well as combinations of these datasets. They present test RMSE on the RUL prediction task and plots of different battery degradation metrics such as battery capacity vs number of charge cycles.

### Strengths
- The paper is written clearly, it lays out the current problems well and provides a good starting point for researchers to build their experiments/methods.

- The unified data format looks very useful for researchers to work with multiple datasets easily providing opportunities for future work in transfer learning and other areas.

- The set of standard feature extractors for battery data is also very useful for ML researchers without battery expertise to get started quickly in battery research.

- The paper provides a link to the git repository which includes more notebooks, plots, and other useful details.

### Weaknesses
- There is little discussion of which models/datasets performed best for the RUL task. Were there certain models which outperform others and if so why?

- While this paper provides a practical software tool for battery data research, it does not provide novel insights or modeling techniques that advance the state of the art in battery SOH or RUL prediction. While RMSE numbers for the RUL task are presented in table 2, the results are not discussed in the text nor are the advantages/disadvantages of each method. Additionally, the paper does not propose new models or methodology to improve the prediction performance on either the RUL or SOH tasks.

### Questions
- Table 2 has bolded results for the top set of rows (MATR1, MATR2, HUST, SNL), but not the second set. Could you bold the results in the second set of rows as well to highlight the best performing models on those datasets?

- Some table references in the appendix are not clickable.

### Summary
The paper proposes a software framework titled BatteryML that provides a unified data representation for the multitude of publicly available datasets, each with its own unique set of variables, goals and representation schemes.
In addition to providing an opportunity for battery science and ML experts to collaborate, the platform is meant to encourage the development of algorithms that are less specific to certain data collection schemes and more generally applicable.
Finally, with an array of tools for feature extraction, data preprocessing and access to more modern machine learning models, BatteryML seeks to collectively advance the state of battery research.

### Strengths
- The quality of writing and clarity go a long way to contextualizing how and why the proposed framework is important.
- The choice of long and detailed examples to highlight different portions of the software framework adds depth to the discussions about the framework.
- Figure 1 gives a concise overview of the entire framework, that is quickly digestible and informative.

### Weaknesses
- While BatteryML puts a lot of effort into standardizing publicly available datasets and making them accessible to work with, for the wider community, I'm curious how much of the detailed battery science gets communicated to the end-user, or whether the layer of abstraction necessary to standardize the framework obfuscates the nuances to a large degree. The reason this is important is to enable the development of models that actively support/engage with physical phenomena in the correct fashion (physically plausible explanations).
- There seems to be a mismatch between the keywords used in Figure 1 (Normalization) and subsequent descriptions, which use Data Preprocessing. 
- SOC seems to be used prior to being explicitly defined (1st occurrence in Pg. 2, Contributions while definition is in Section 3.3)

### Questions
- Could the authors clarify how much communication, about the details of battery science and the nuances of various electro-chemical processes involved in battery science is effectively relayed to the end-user, to help formulate models that match physical phenomena? In case this is limited, could the authors justify how the framework could help machine learning researchers effectively collaborate with battery science researchers?
- Could the authors clarify which among Normalization or Data preprocessing is the correct nomenclature, and update the manuscript to maintain consistency?
- In addition, please make sure that all acronyms remain well defined prior to their usage.
- The addition of an example detailing a custom data preprocessing/feature extraction technique would highlight the flexibility of the framework even further.

### Summary
This paper presents an open-sourced unified platform and framework for battery life research, including various modules such as configuration, data processing, feature extraction, modeling, and evaluation. Specifically, the authors integrated multiple data sources under a unified data representation, allowing comprehensive comparison of different approaches on a uniform set of evaluation criteria. This work enables ML researchers to propose more interesting and complicated battery science models.

### Strengths
**Originality:** To the best of my knowledge, this work fills the gap between battery science research and ML research. As stated in the paper, the lack of such a platform is a blocker for both the battery science community and the machine learning community.

**Clarity:** The paper is easy to follow in general, though it might be better to include more details on the methodology and framework with some discussions.

**Significance:** The authors have done significant enough work on data cleaning and processing, feature extraction, model implementation and evaluation, metrics reporting, etc.

### Weaknesses
One of the potential improvements of this work is to include more discussions on the compared algorithms. I think it will be really helpful for people using this framework to get to know the existing approaches better, and their advantages and limitations for different tasks, then making this work more impactful.

### Questions
Specifically, I could imagine the paper would be more convincing if more discussion and comparison are included. Some of the examples I could imagine include:
- Having more comparison and discussions between the methods from different categories, such as conventional methods vs tree-based methods vs NN-based methods.
- Within each category, it would be helpful to show the comparison as well.
- It would be helpful to have a more detailed ablation study on the hyperparameter choices, feature selections, etc.
- It could also be beneficial to include a transformer model as well for the NN-based method or explain why this is not a method considered in the paper.
