# ValUES: A Framework for Systematic Validation of Uncertainty Estimation in Semantic Segmentation

- Decision: Accept (oral)
- Scores: 8, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Uncertainty estimation is an essential and heavily-studied component for the reliable application of semantic segmentation methods. While various studies exist claiming methodological advances on the one hand, and successful application on the other hand, the field is currently hampered by a gap between theory and practice leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Can data-related and model-related uncertainty really be separated in practice? Which components of an uncertainty method are essential for real-world performance? Which uncertainty method works well for which application? In this work, we link this research gap to a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods. Specifically, we identify three key pitfalls in current literature and present an evaluation framework that bridges the research gap by providing 1) a controlled environment for studying data ambiguities as well as distribution shifts, 2) systematic ablations of relevant method components, and 3) test-beds for the five predominant uncertainty applications: OoD-detection, active learning, failure detection, calibration, and ambiguity modeling. Empirical results on simulated as well as real-world data demonstrate how the proposed framework is able to answer the predominant questions in the field revealing for instance that 1) separation of uncertainty types works on simulated data but does not necessarily translate to real-world data, 2) aggregation of scores is a crucial but currently neglected component of uncertainty methods, 3) While ensembles are performing most robustly across the different downstream tasks and settings, test-time augmentation often constitutes a light-weight alternative.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper addresses the widely recognized disparity between theory and practical implementation within the field of uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation. In order to bridge this gap, the paper highlights the three key components of any uncertainty method and outlines the associated pitfalls and requirements for addressing these pitfalls.

### Strengths
The paper's approach to addressing the gap between theory and practice in the field is commendable and serves to underscore its originality and significance. It offers a systematic framework that effectively addresses limitations seen in prior research. The paper appropriately points out the various pitfalls present in earlier works, even though they were generally well-regarded (some having high citation counts). To the best of my knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to systematically and explicitly evaluate these pitfalls across not only a toy dataset but also two real-world datasets (LIDC-IDRI and GTA5/Cityscapes). The insights provided by the authors are valuable in confirming that certain theoretical claims, originally validated on toy datasets, may not necessarily translate to at least two real-world datasets. Moreover, it sheds light on what works effectively with ensembles, a commonly used benchmark for uncertainty estimation.

I have to highlight that in this type of works it is always possible to think about more architectures, more datasets and more analysis, but given the limited space (in terms of pages) available, and all the material already in appendices, I believe that the authors chose a good scope for their analysis. In this sense, the quality and clarity of this work is equally very good, given how difficult it is to summarise so many results - Figure 2 (with more details in appendix) thus seemed to me an acceptable and useful way to present such results.

This work will likely become essential for anyone in the field seeking scientific advancement and a deeper understanding of uncertainty estimations within their specific applications. Hopefully, this paper will prompt the community to pay closer attention to their validation practices. In light of its potential for significant impact in multiple areas, I confidently endorse for its acceptance. I believe it would be fair for this work to have a score of 10, but I prefer to wait for the remaining reviews, during the rebuttal period.

### Weaknesses
It is regrettable that component C0 was fixed (for each dataset) and not explored for at least another architecture. However, I might say that such a weakness is well within the realm of usual limitations expected in a paper.

The decisions pertaining to component C1 involve numerous hyperparameters, with some known to have a significant impact on performance. Consequently, this represents another weakness in the study, as it appears that these hyperparameters were not thoroughly investigated.

Figure 2 uses different colours to distinguish distinct parts of the figure. This is not friendly for people with colour deficiency, and the authors could try to include patterns on top of the colour scheme.

### Questions
I do not have any further questions.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Authors present an empirical study to assess uncertainty estimation
methods, focusing on their ability to separate aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty and performance on down-stream tasks. Through three data
sets, one being completely toy. From the experimental results, author
present their conclusions in the main text. Methods cannot seem to
separate AU from EU in real data sets. Performance on downstream tasks
vary greatly.

### Strengths
1. Uncertainty estimation is an important problem. Assessment of
   estimated uncertainty is a challenging yet critical topic. 
2. Evaluation through multiple downstream tasks is an interesting
   direction. Adopting this approach would surely improve the
   assessment methodology in the field. This is possibly the strongest
   point of this work.
3. Authors seem to have done a large amount of experimentation
   covering different aspects.

### Weaknesses
I have two concerns regarding this article: 

1. I am not sharing the enthusiasm of the authors regarding the need
   to separate AU and EU. They note that downstream tasks are
   important - which I fully agree. To solve those downstream tasks, I
   would not require a separation of uncertainty terms. What is the
   main value of this separation beyond a "theoretical" understanding?
   Perhaps authors should provide a strong justification as to why one
   must care about this separation... 
2. I find the presentation style not optimal. Authors mostly provide
   summary results in the main text and the quantitative results in
   the appendix. Appendix should be there to support an otherwise
   self-contained main text. Here, I do not think the main text is
   self-contained.

### Questions
1. What is the aim for separating AU from EU?

**  The novelty is limited. The primary contribution seems to conduct additional experiments using existing methods.

**  The experiments presented in the main text is not persuasiveness, and the binary (yes or no) outcomes remain inconclusive.

**  Please provide detailed analytically experimental or theoretical proofs

**  It would be better to conduct more ablation studies using different backbones (e.g., VIT based model).

### Questions
**  What is the main innovation of this paper? Please provide detailed explanations of the contribution points.

**  Please show the justification to establish the significance of the motivation. It is suggested to explain why this motivation is particularly important.

### Summary
In this work, the authors provide an extensive study and guidelines for uncertainty estimation (UE) and its applications. Specifically, they assign terminologies to different components in the UE pipeline and study how each component affects the end result. UE as a field has several ambiguous and poorly proven results, and hence the authors’ work provides a meaningful understanding. They provide extensive empirical results to validate their claims.

### Strengths
1) The authors ask several good questions such as: separability of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty; which predictive model and uncertainty measure to use; as well as how choosing the downstream task is important in designing a good UE pipeline. 
2) The authors break down the whole UE pipeline and identify different components well. They also consider the most relevant downstream tasks for UE.
3) The authors provide a good discussion about existing pitfalls in UE research with respect to each component. They cite good references for this.
4) The authors conduct thoughtful experiments to study AU/EU, for eg: applying gaussian blur to the toy example and getting multiple raters’ annotations; changing shape/intensity for EU etc.

### Weaknesses
1) The authors mention that “Overall, surpassing the ‘random’ AL baseline appears challenging, with marginal improvements on LIDC MAL and GTA5/CS”. However, great strides have been made in AL, and works have obtained significant improvements like in [1]. Could the authors discuss this?
2) The authors mention that “The choice of aggregation method exhibits dataset-dependent variability” and “The choice of aggregation method yields mixed results on LIDC TEX, similar to other downstream tasks”. Is there any recommended guidelines on which approach works best in which setting, or, should users try all combinations?

### Questions
1) Please also see weakness above.
2) It seems the authors have considered sampling-based methods in their study. How would the discussion be if the method is sampling-free like [2]?
3) As the authors have considered SSNs, would the discussion for probabilistic methods like Probabilistic UNet [3] be similar or different?
