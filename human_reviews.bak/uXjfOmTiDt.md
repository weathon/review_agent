- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial patches has motivated numerous defense strategies for boosting model robustness. However, the prevailing defenses depend on single observation or pre-established adversary information to counter adversarial patches, often failing to be confronted with unseen or adaptive adversarial attacks and easily exhibiting unsatisfying performance in dynamic 3D environments. Inspired by active human perception and recurrent feedback mechanisms, we develop Embodied Active Defense (EAD), a proactive defensive strategy that actively contextualizes environmental information to address misaligned adversarial patches in 3D real-world settings. To achieve this, EAD develops two central recurrent sub-modules, i.e., a perception module and a policy module, to implement two critical functions of active vision. These models recurrently process a series of beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of their comprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategic actions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments. To optimize learning efficiency, we incorporate a differentiable approximation of environmental dynamics and deploy patches that are agnostic to the adversary’s strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAD substantially enhances robustness against a variety of patches within just a few steps through its action policy in safety-critical tasks (e.g., face recognition and object detection), without compromising standard accuracy. Furthermore, due to the attack-agnostic characteristic, EAD facilitates excellent generalization to unseen attacks, diminishing the averaged attack success rate by 95% across a range of unseen adversarial attacks.

### Summary
It develops Embodied Active Defense (EAD), a proactive defensive strategy that actively contextualizes environmental information to address misaligned adversarial patches in 3D real-world settings. To achieve this, EAD develops two central recurrent sub-modules, i.e., a perception module and a policy module, to implement two critical functions of active vision. These models recurrently process a series of beliefs and observations, facilitating progressive refinement of their comprehension of the target object and enabling the development of strategic actions to counter adversarial patches in 3D environments.

### Strengths
To optimize learning efficiency, it  incorporates a differentiable approximation of environmental dynamics and deploy patches that are agnostic to the adversary’s strategies.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAD substantially enhances robustness against a variety of patches within just a few steps through its action policy in safety-critical tasks (e.g., face recognition and object detection), without compromising standard accuracy.

Furthermore, due to the attack-agnostic characteristic, EAD facilitates excellent generalization to unseen attacks, diminishing the averaged attack success rate by 95% across a range of unseen adversarial attacks.

It theoretically demonstrates the effectiveness of EAD from the perspective of information theory. A well-learned EAD model for contrastive task adopts a greedy informative policy to explore the environment, utilizing the rich context information to reduce the abnormally high uncertainty of scenes caused by adversarial patches.

### Weaknesses
It mentions the policy model with actions, and states. It is better to provide more details or examples to specify what the actions and states look like or their physical meanings if any. 

It is better to discuss the complexity for the training and inference of the proposed method.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose an active defense strategy that leverages active movements and recurrent perceptual feedback from the environment to defend against arbitrary adversarial patch attacks. The experiment results show that the proposed strategy can outperform SOTA passive defense strategies in terms of effectiveness and generalizability.

### Strengths
1. The authors present a pioneering approach in the realm of adversarial robustness by introducing the first proactive defense strategy with embodied perception. It adds to the current defense strategies against patch attacks, which were predominantly passive.
2. The experiment findings clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed strategy over previous SOTAs. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that an embodied model with environmental interaction ability can not only mitigate the uncertainty posed by adversarial attacks easily but also be trained with weak attacks like uniform-perturbed patches.

### Weaknesses
1. In Section 4.2, the authors mention the effectiveness against adaptive attack; however, I find it hard to understand the reason why a surrogate **uniform** superset policy distribution would necessitate an optimized patch to handle various action policies, as this uniform surrogate may not contain any useful information about the policy model in EAD for the adversary to attack.
2. The paper could benefit from improved clarity, especially for readers with a foundational understanding of adversarial robustness but limited exposure to RL/Robotics. As it stands, the document is dense with jargon, making it challenging to navigate and comprehend upon the initial read.

### Questions
1. For those adversarially-trained passive defense models, would it be beneficial to enhance them with 3D-augmented data, e.g., feeding multiple views of the same patch-attacked human face during training, if the lack of 3D environment awareness is the problem here?
2. There is one part I feel confused about in the algorithm box: $O_t′ \gets A(O_t, P; S_t)$ and $O_{t+1}'\gets A(O_{t+1},P;S_{t+1})$, where do $O_t'$ and $O_{t+1}'$ go? They are not explicitly used or referenced anywhere else post-assignment. Are clean observations $O_t$ and $O_{t+1}$ overwritten by $O_t'$ and $O_{t+1}'$ after applied with the adversarial patch by default?

### Summary
The paper proposes a model robustness approach Embodied Active Defense (EAD) for perception models against adversarial patches. EAD comprises of perception module to extract the image observation features and policy module to interact with the environment (modeled by decision transformer). The paper hypothesizes that passive robustness methods (i.e without temporal information or scene contextual information) would not be sufficient for unseen adversarial attacks and needs active feedback from the environment to achieve better model robustness. EAD training is a two stage learning approach performed in a dynamic environment (i.e. the generative space of faces using EG3D or CARLA simulation)  - 1) training the perceptual model for the specific task (for eg face recognition or object detection) using random policy 2) co-training the perception module along with the policy. The paper shows robustness to different types of patch based adversarial attacks and adaptive adversarial attacks. The paper also proposes to introduce uniformly sampled noise as adversarial examples while training the model that perturbs the observation. The paper empirically shows adversarial robustness improvement across unseen type of attacks and also shows improvement on clean samples (i.e overall test accuracy of a task in scenarios where adversarial samples are not introduced).

### Strengths
The paper explores an adversarial robustness technique that helps the model to achieve better adversarial robustness in a dynamic environment. The proposed approach “Embodied Active Defense (EAD)” achieves improvement on various patch adversarial attack methods for the tasks of face recognition and object detection. The paper provides ablation experiments to analyze the various components of EAD algorithm. Ablation experiments regarding the strength of adversarial attacks (by increasing the patch size or increasing the iteration of iterative adversarial attacks) sheds light on the robustness of the proposed model against strong version of adversarial attacks. The supplementary material contains code for reproducibility

### Weaknesses
Overall, the paper writing style and organization needs improvement to allow the reader to easily understand the paper.
It would be helpful for the reader to get a better understanding for the following:
1.  Some general suggestions regarding paper organizing. It would be great to introduce the problem statement for each of the tasks:
    1.  For eg. definition/explaining of the subtasks of FR : Impersonation and dodging.
    2.  Environmental model definition (State, Action, Transition Function and Observation Function similar to Face Recognition task) for object detection on CARLA simulator or ShapeNet EG3D.
    3. In the related section, a brief explanation of the attacks used for evaluation.
    4. Annotation definitions before introducing in the paper (for eg y^{_}_t prediction of the model) 
    5. (Optional) a readme for the codebase, to understand the outline of the codebase.
2. The paper makes a claim that passive adversarial defense approach are not sufficient for dynamics environment. This claim should be supported by a passive defense used as a baseline. Also, it would be great to see the extra amount of training resources used to train the active embodied model vs a passive defense approach (for eg Madry's PGD adversarial training). It would also help the readers if some other active defenses would be used as a baseline in order to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach.
3. The experimental (both training and evaluation) setting does not seem sufficient and scalable enough to make conclusions that it would general. For example “To train EAD for face recognition, we randomly sample images from 2, 500 distinct identities from the training set of CelebA-3D.” and “we report the white-box attack success rate (ASR) on 100 identity pairs in both impersonation and dodging attacks with various attack methods”.

Minor Typo/ suggestions  
EAD comprises two primary submodules: -> EAD comprises of two primary submodules:

Notely, it maintains or even improves standard accuracy due to -> Notably, it maintains or even improves standard accuracy due to

Formally, It derives a strategic action -> Formally, it derives

“they have now developed to perceive various perception models”

“It is noteworthy this presents a more versatile 3D formulation for adversarial patches”

from given scene x with its annotation y from another modal like CLIP -> from given scene x with its annotation y from another model like CLIP

“In D.5 MORE EVALUATION RESULTS ON EG3D, We present the iterative defense process in Figure ??.”  

In the statement “EAD presents a promising direction for enhancing robustness without any negative social impact”, it might be helpful to limit this statement as the one of the tasks being used is facial recognition that could have some unwanted impact .

### Questions
It would be helpful if the paper could answer/clarify the following questions:
1. How much training time/ wall clock time and memory resources does it take for the EAD defense (both at training and inference phase).
2. The general assumption about adversary is that it is not bound by computation resources. For example the statement in the paper for adaptive attacks “While the deterministic and differential approximation could enable backpropagation through the entire inference trajectory of EAD, the computational cost is prohibitive due to rapid GPU memory consumption as trajectory length τ increases”, here for Face recognition can we do a white box attack by following the gradients for all the 4 -step trajectory?
3. In the paper the description for Figure 3 mentions that “subsequent active interactions with the environment progressively reduce the similarity between the positive pair”. Is this a typo, should this be “reduce the dissimilarity” or “increase the similarity”?
4. In Algorithm 1, the perturbed observation O’t is not being used, is there a typo there ?

### Summary
The paper proposes a defense against patch-based adversarial attacks on visual recognition models. It utilizes the concept of emodied perception (wherein the model is allowed to interact with its environment to refine its belief) to mitigate the effect of 'out-of-place' patches in the scene and, in turn, improve the model's robustness against patch-based attacks. The authors implement embodied perception as a partially observable markov decision process. The overall system comprises of two new models: a perception model and a policy model. The perception model maintains an 'understanding' of the scene which it progressively updates based on new observations. The policy model dictates a transition process that is focused on improving the quality of observations to improve recognition. Given an initial observation, the system progressively refines its belief using the perception and policy models. Through two visual recognition tasks: face recognition and object detection, authors demonstrate the effectiveness of emodied perception based defense to not only improve robustness against seen and unseen attacks, but also improve standard performance.

### Strengths
1. Overall, the writing quality and presentation of the paper is excellent. The authors lay out the motivation behind their method and challenges behind implementing it adequately. All necessary background is provided so that a person unfamiliar with the topic can follow along. The figures and tables present information effectively.
2. The authors propose a novel application of emodied perception, using it as a defense against patch-based adversarial attacks, making it the first defense of its kind.
3. The design of the method is clever and intricate, and is intuitively grounded in the understanding of human perception.
4. The defense is task agnostic, and should conceptually work with any visual recognition task.
5. The authors provide a theoretical understanding for the effectiveness of EAD using information theory.
6. The ablation presented in the paper is thorough, and covers all the different components of the method as well as newly introduced hyperparameters.
7. The method improves both standard and adversarial performance relative to prior defenses. Interestingly, standard performance is improved even over undefended baseline. Overall, improvements introduced by proposed method appear substantial.

### Weaknesses
1. There is no discussion regarding the computational cost of the proposed method and how it compares to the undefended baseline as well as prior defenses.
2. An end-to-end attack is not necessarily the strongest adaptive attack, especially for defenses with complicated forward passes. Attacking the weakest component should be sufficient. To identify the weakest component, authors should try independently attacking perception and policy models to make them less effective in their respective tasks. For example, attacking perception model would involve generating an input that forces the perception model to output a corrupted internal belief vector b_t (using a latent space attack [a]).
3. There are no theoretical results establishing how the approximations used in Sec 3.3 relate to the actual quantities. If possible to obtain, this would be nice to have.

### Questions
1. How does the computational cost of the proposed method compares to the baselines?
2. How does the method fare against an adaptive attack targeting the weakest component in the pipeline (see further details in the Weaknesses section)? I'd love to increase my rating further if you can better convince me that the defense is robust against adaptive attacks.
3. Why is the enhanced version of SAC less robust against dodging attacks than regular SAC (in table 1)?
