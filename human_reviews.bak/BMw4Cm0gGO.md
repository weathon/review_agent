- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
The Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) allows to solve safety-critical decision making tasks that are subject to constraints. 
While CMDPs have been extensively studied in the Reinforcement Learning literature, little attention has been given to sampling-based planning algorithms such as MCTS for solving them. Previous approaches perform conservatively with respect to costs as they avoid constraint violations by using Monte Carlo cost estimates that suffer from high variance. We propose Constrained MCTS (C-MCTS), which estimates cost using a safety critic that is trained with Temporal Difference learning in an offline phase prior to agent deployment. The critic limits exploration by pruning unsafe trajectories within MCTS during deployment. C-MCTS satisfies cost constraints but operates closer to the constraint boundary, achieving higher rewards than previous work. As a nice byproduct, the planner is more efficient w.r.t. planning steps. Most importantly, under model mismatch between the planner and the real world, C-MCTS is less susceptible to cost violations than previous work.

### Summary
This paper introduces Constrained MCTS (C-MCTS), an MCTS-based novel approach for solving CMDP decision-making tasks. This approach avoids constraint violations by pre-training a safety critic before agent deployment with TD learning using simulator data. The pre-trained safety critic eliminates the need for tuning a Lagrange multiplier online. The experiments in two environments, Rocksample and Safe Gridworld, show that C-MCTS outperforms existing approaches. It prunes unsafe branches of the search tree during deployment, achieving higher rewards while ensuring safety. Most importantly, it is less susceptible under the model mismatch between the simulator and the real-world environment.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method to pre-train a safety critic using the TD-based method. By negating the need to tune the Lagrange multiplier online, the pre-training phase allows the use of a more computationally expensive high-fidelity simulator, thereby producing better results. Besides, it also allows the ensemble method to be applied to have more robust results.

### Weaknesses
While the method is novel and straightforward, there are two major concerns as follows.

First, the time complexity of C-MCTS seems higher than normal MCTS. In the expansion of C-MCTS, the safety critic is used to evaluate all actions. This greatly increases the computing resources when applying in the large action space domains or using more MCTS simulations. In addition, considering C-MCTS uses additional resources to tune a Lagrange multiplier, the comparison between C-MCTS and CC-MCP is unfair. The authors should provide the detailed time complexity for C-MCTS, and the time for the pre-training phase for comparison.

Second, the experimental environments are quite simple, so it is hard to convincingly evaluate the out-of-distribution scenarios where states are completely unseen during deployment. The author should add experiments on more complex environments, e.g., the MuJoCo physics simulator.

### Questions
* P2, Figure 1. As introduced in Section 3.1, the training phase uses MCTS to solve MDP, which should also be added to the figure for better understanding.
* P2, Section 2.1. Use bold font to emphasize sets (especially for $C$ and $\hat{c}$) in definitions and equations for clear reading. All policies $\Pi$ is undefined in equation (1).
* P3, Section 2.2, "Lee et al. (2018) proposed Cost-Constrained Monte Carlo Planning (CC-MCP)". This is incorrect since Lee et al. proposed Cost-Constrained POMCP (CC-POMCP) instead of CC-MCP. Although it applies to CMDPs, the authors should revise the statement to clarify this.
* P3, Section 3.1. Clarify what "e.g., in simulation" means. Does it mean to vary parameters during MCTS simulation in the pre-training phase? In addition, $V_{C}^{k,*}$ is undefined.
* P4, Section 3.1.1, Definition 3. In equation (5), it seems meaningless to define $\mathop{\min}_{a'} {Q^{\pi}_{c}(s,a')} <= Q^{\pi}_{c}(s,a)$ when $\forall a' \in A$.
* P4, Proposition 2, "This is not only numerically infeasible, but it is also due to the utilization of the low-fidelity simulator in the MCTS planner." It is still unclear why this is numerically infeasible. In common sense, even if a low-fidelity simulator is employed, it is still likely that the critic can provide perfect estimation for some state-action pairs, especially for those near the terminal states.
* P5, Section 3.1.1, Corollary 1, "As discussed before, the inner training loop will always converge to the optimal solution for the k−th MDP." The convergence happens when there are sufficient training simulations, as stated in Proposition 1. However, did the conducted experiment have sufficient simulations to achieve the convergence, i.e., the optimal solution?
* P6, Section 4, "the selected environments clearly "emulate" the complexity that stems from domains with large state/action spaces (Schrittwieser et al., 2020b; Afsar et al., 2022)." Please clarify the reason for citing these two papers here. They do not seem to have any discussion about the selected environments.
* P8, Section 4.2, "with a grid search". Did the optimized $\alpha_0$ and $\epsilon$ highly affected the final performance? The authors should provide the grid search results in the appendix for reference.

### Summary
The paper proposes an MCTS variant for safety-critical scenarios. The variant expands in leaf nodes only actions that are deemed safe and feasible by a safety-critic model. The model is optimized in a pre-training phase.

The MCTS variant is compared favorably with two other MCTS variants in two grid-worlds.

### Strengths
Dealing with safety constraint is probably one of the weaknesses of the RL approaches, and one of the main obstacles for applying RL and planning algorithms like MCTS in real world scenarios. While in many of those scenarios, the algorithms are faced with continuous state/action spaces, tackling the issue in discrete spaces is also important.  

The extension of the MCTS for constrained MDP seems fairly reasonable.

### Weaknesses
While there is some theoretical work included, these do not offer sufficient guarantees for practical applicability. The proposed algorithm could be a step towards an practical application, but it is not there as it is.   

Given that this is a largely empirical article, the experimental evaluation is rather small. The benchmarks are small and fairly simple, while that set of baselines is also limited.

### Questions
I understand that there are not many MCTS implementation supporting constrained MDP, but there are a sufficient number of alternative planning algorithms that could have been used as additional baselines.

The size (especially the small number of possible actions) and the limited number of benchmarks are difficult to understand. If this would be a theoretical paper (or at least one offering significantly new algorithmic ideas) using these tasks for illustration would be fine. But, for a mainly empirical paper, the limitation of the experiments are difficult to understand.

### Summary
Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are environments subjected to constraints and have been addressed extensively using reinforcement learning techniques. Few sample-based planning algorithms have been applied to such problems. The paper introduces an MCTS-based approach for learning cost-conscious policies for CMDPs.

### Strengths
**Orignality:** While not introducing a completely novel approach, they apply an offline learning technique to estimate costs in CMDPs online.

**Significance:** The contributions of the paper lack significance.

**Clarity:** The paper is understandable.

### Weaknesses
The main drawback of the paper is its lack of significance. The approach introduced is not novel. Learning values/cost estimates offline to be applied online is not a new idea. Nor is the learning approach using a novel technique.

I also question the soundness of the analysis. In Prop. 1, the authors claim that at each iteration of their algorithm, they are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. They base their claim on the proof in [Kocsis & Szepesvari, 2006]. However, that work states that UCT is guaranteed to converge in the limit --- it is not guaranteed to converge in finite-time.

The experiments also do not demonstrate the claimed performance improvements achieved by their approach. While C-MCTS significantly outperforms CC-MCP in Rocksample, it does not necessarily outperform MCTS. Nor does it significantly have less cost violations than CC-MCP. Furthermore, CC-MCP searches deeper than C-MCTS in Rocksample(11, 11).

The experiments themselves also do not seem. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems, that C-MCTS gets extra computations. The cost for pre-training should be factored into the planning budget.

### Questions
Corollary 1: How can you guarantee optimality if you prune sub-trees for which the cost is over-estimated?

What exactly is a "boundary region?"

The lengths of the arrows are difficult to distinguish in Fig. 4. I would suggest finding a different way to visualize the number of times an action is selected.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel algorithm, C-MCTS, for solving problems with constraints.
The proposed algorithm is tested on two small benchmark problems and shows improving performances compared to the baseline algorithms, CC-MCP and vanilla MCTS.

### Strengths
- C-MCTS achieves improving performance in the quality of the solutions while not violating the cost constraints.

### Weaknesses
- The actual running time of the experiments needs to be provided.

- Several points need to be clarified in the explanation that is described in the Questions below.

### Questions
- About proof of Proposition 1 in P.4.
"... guaranteed to find the optimal solution in the k-th MDP."
UCT's proof is asymptotic, and we need an infinite number of simulations to guarantee the convergence to the optimal.
Also, we have no way of knowing whether we actually reached the optimal (in my understanding).
Does this proof assume that we do an infinite number of simulations on each iteration? Is that valid?

- Also, I may have overlooked, but how long does this step take in the actual experiments in Section 4? (is it the "Solve MDP" step in Fig. 1?) 

- How meaningful is it to count the number of cost violations?
In what problem settings are we not allowed to violate the cost even during the simulations?

- For Fig. 2, how was the actual execution time of the three algorithms?
Also, for the Safe GridWorld experiment, did C-MCTS with $2^9$ planning iterations and CC-MCP with $2^{20}$ planning iterations take a similar amount of time?

- About Fig. 4.
What is one episode here?
Does one episode for C-MCTS and CC-MCP require a similar amount of time?
If the latter is faster, could we run CC-MCP 100 times and select the path based on the majority?

Minor question.
- I got confused with the notation of $C, c, \hat{c}$. Are these sets or functions?
