# SketchEdit: Editing Freehand Sketches At The Stroke-Level

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Freehand sketching is a representation of human cognition of the real world. Recent sketch synthesis methods have demonstrated the capability of generating lifelike outcomes. However, these methods directly encode the whole sketch instances and makes it challenging to decouple the strokes from the sketches and have difficulty in controlling local sketch synthesis, e.g., stroke editing. Besides, the sketch editing task encounters the issue of accurately positioning the edited strokes, because users may not be able to draw on the exact position and the same stroke may appear on various locations in different sketches. We propose SketchEdit to realize flexible editing of sketches at the stroke-level for the first time. To tackle the challenge of decoupling strokes, our SketchEdit divides a drawing sequence of a sketch into a series of strokes based on the pen state, align the stroke segments to have the same starting position, and learns the embeddings of every stroke by a proposed stroke encoder. This design allows users to conveniently select the strokes for editing at any locations. Moreover, we overcome the problem of stroke placement via a diffusion process, which progressively generate the locations for the strokes to be synthesized, using the stroke features as the guiding condition. Both the stroke embeddings and the generated locations are fed into a sequence decoder to synthesize the manipulated sketch. The stroke encoder and the sequence decoder are jointly pre-trained under the autoencoder paradigm, with an extra image decoder to learn the local structure of sketches. Experiments demonstrate that the SketchEdit is effective for stroke-level sketch editing and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the sketch reconstruction task.

### Summary
This work aims to propose a method for stroke-level sketch editing. It addresses the challenges of decoupling strokes from sketches and accurately positioning edited strokes. The proposed approach divides the drawing sequence into individual strokes and learns stroke embeddings using a stroke encoder. Users can easily select and edit strokes at any location. The diffusion process is used to generate precise locations for the strokes based on their features. These stroke embeddings and locations are then fed into a sequence decoder to synthesize the manipulated sketch.

### Strengths
- It introduces the idea of stroke-level editing, allowing users to modify specific strokes in a sketch while preserving the overall structure. This is an interesting point, which is meaningful when finer control over stroke is required.

- Another contribution of this work is that the authors employ a diffusion model for stroke placement, i.e., generating stroke locations based on their features. The deployment of diffusion models on stroke placement seems novel.

### Weaknesses
- The focus of this work is on sketch editing, however, there are no specific experiments conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of the model. Perhaps the quality of the experiments could be improved by introducing editing-related tasks, such as stroke replacement/modification/interpolation, and providing analysis on how these change or improve the visual outcomes and the obtained matrics scores.

- The novelty of the paper is somehow limited. The proposed method for generating sketches is mainly based on combining existing techniques. Diffusion models have been leveraged to model locations of stroke points [A, B]. The concept of generating parts/strokes and subsequently assembling them to create a sketch is not new either [C]. Please refer to the attached papers for more information.

- From Table 1, compared with using the original locations, the generation results with the generated stroke locations will decrease dramatically, caused by undesired stroke location shift, category changes, and messy stroke placement. Although the authors had provided some analysis on this, this could be a significant limitation of the work.

- Regarding the sketch reconstruction comparison mentioned in section 4.3, the proposed method utilizes the original stroke location rather than the generated ones. It would be beneficial to evaluate the performance of using the full model in conjunction with location generation. This will help readers to understand the proposed method better.

### Questions
Please find my major concerns in the weaknesses. Additionally, I have a few questions that require clarification from the authors.

- From Figure 2, it is evident that when a stroke is edited, the remaining strokes remain unchanged. The question arises, how does the decoder accomplish this? 
- Will the number of strokes remain unchanged when implementing the proposed model?
- Why stroke normalization is required?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method to do conditional sketch generation with conditioning done on a stroke level: given a sketch, one or more strokes are replaced, and the diffusion model is used to find the position of the modified strokes to create a plausible sketch. Diffusion model operates on the stroke representation in latent space. To obtain the latent space, an autoencoder is trained with per-stroke encoder and sequence / image decoder. Method is evaluated against other methods by the quality of the sketch reconstruction. The proposed approach allows combining pieces of multiple sketches together, on a stroke level.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper proposes using diffusion models for generating sketches at stroke level. This is novel in a limited way (there have been previous works on sketch image generation with diffusion models, mentioned by authors; there have been previous works on handwriting strokes generation with diffusion models, ex. "Diffusion models for Handwriting Generation", Luhman & Luhman 2020).

Quality: The paper provides a detailed description of the approach, likely fostering reproducibility.

Significance: The proposed approach seems to learn a good sketch embedding space, as evident from the interpolations, and recognition quality of the reconstruction.

### Weaknesses
Significance: The main contribution of the approach is not articulated well - what are the circumstances in which the specific process described in the paper would be relevant (removing a stroke from a sketch, replacing it with a different stroke, and finding the best positioning for the stokes).

Quality: The comparison on the reconstruction quality misses comparisons to numerous recent works, ex. to name a few
- Abstracting Sketches through Simple Primitives, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13543.pdf - studies the reconstuction quality and breakdown of sketches into individual elements, shows reconstuction quality numbers higher than those shown by the authors (although the comparison is not fair as it evaluates on a full set rather than two subsets)
- Multi-Graph Transformer for Free-Hand Sketch Recognition, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11258.pdf
- Sketchformer: Transformer-based Representation for Sketched Structure, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10381.pdf
- Painter: Teaching Auto-regressive Language Models to Draw Sketches, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08520.pdf

Additionally, the ablation study looks at two small architectural changes (having image decoder, and having a joint token mixture for two decoders), but doesn't really highlight the important questions such as the choice of using the diffusion model, the separate encoding of each stroke compared to the sequence-level embedding, etc. 

Finally, the main reported metric, sketch reconstruction quality, has little correlation with the main idea of the paper, namely stroke level editing, and I believe a human study could be a better fit in these scenarios.

Clarity: The writing is often not clear and contains many typos, ex.
- Sec. 3.3, first line: "pick the to be edited stroke"
- Sec 3.3, second paragraph: "resulting [in] generated stroke locations"
- Sec. 3.3, second paragraph: "synthesis the edited sketch"
- Sec. 3.4, 3rd line: ". Because significant" --> "because significant"
- Sec. 3.5, after eq.4: "with the variance being" -> "with the difference being"
- Sec. 4, first line: "two dataset" -> "two datasets"
- Sec. 4, subsection titles: "implement details" --> "implementation details", "competitors" --> "baselines"
- Sec. 4, metrics section: the metric called "Rec" is simply "Accuracy" and should be referred to as such.

### Questions
I am most interested in authors pinpointing the exact usecase for their proposed solution, and the metrics that could capture the performance in the suggested usecase.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method to perform edits on a sketch at the stroke level.

The proposed method uses denoising diffusion to convert noise into the location where each stroke is placed.
Each stroke in turn is normalized to a consistent starting location and encoded by a stroke-encoder.

After the denoising process, a decoder takes the locations and the embeddings to reconstruct the sketch.

At inference, if a chosen stroke is edited, the edit should transfer to the whole sketch as well after the deneoising process is complete.

The claimed contributions are:
1. **First** sketch synthesis method that works on the stroke level
2. A **fresh** view on the sketch synthesis problem by reformulating it as a problem of placement of strokes.
3. SOTA performance on a) sketch-reconstruction

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to read. 
2. The introduction is well-motivated and the related work section appropriately covers a lot of the previous literature.
3. Figure 2 gives a strong overview of the whole proposed method.

### Weaknesses
I find many weaknesses in the whole paper, which I will describe below:

**(MAJOR) Using the original locations for computing reconstruction metrics**

---

In Table 2. you measure the reconstruction quality of the model - this is a very unfair competition to the rest of the methods - those methods do not have access to the original locations, so it seems a bit intuitive that your method will perform really well.

What youre measuring then is then basically how well the sketch-encoder and the sequence decoder work. In practice, you have almost trained an autoencoder model!.

Without using the original location (table 1), the proposed method has a REC score on par with SP-gra2seq (Table 2). The FID is lower than other methods (because you are using original locations and/or a reconstruction loss). The LPIPS using the generated locations is comparable to Sketch-RNN which is a paper from 2017!.

Just having good reconstruction does not make a useful contribution.

**(MAJOR ) Lack of convincing qualitative comparisons**

---

The low scores would still be acceptable if the actual use-case of editing was comprehensively shown, but we are only shown a few examples in Figure 1. (where the original stroke and the edited stroke themselves aer not shown). I am not sure what the authors intend to show with the two generations - is the model unable to copy the edited stroke faithfully? or are the two generations because of two input edits? The figure and the caption do not make it clear.

The examples in Fig3 are also unconvincing - when using the locations from the diffusion model, the unedited parts change significantly!
eg the wings on the bumblebee example columns 5/6
the cat moves up and down considerably.

**(MAJOR) Because of points 1 and points 2, the novelty is unconvincing**

I would accept the paper if the results were impressive. However, they are not. This makes the paper a bit problematic to accept because the major components already exist

1. GMM modeling comes from [1] and [2] with the EM algorithm also lifted from there
2. Token based MLPs come from [3]

The major contribution would be the token mixture block but that is not presented or ablated in great detail. The mixture block is what gives the model permutation invaraince which is needed for handling sketches composed of strokes. The sequence composition is itself not detailed - do you permute the sequence of strokes or is the model itself permutation invarianct becuase of the MLP, and the encoding CNN being applied independently.

**(MINOR) Grammar not being in the continuous tense**

---

A lot of the text is titiled something like "Pre-train the stroke encoder..." and "Train the diffusion model" instead of "Pre-training the stroke encoder..." and "Training the diffusion model".
