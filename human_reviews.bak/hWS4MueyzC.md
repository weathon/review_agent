# Bongard-OpenWorld: Few-Shot Reasoning for Free-form Visual Concepts in the Real World

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
We introduce Bongard-OpenWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating real-world few-shot reasoning for machine vision. It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2)  real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.

### Summary
The paper introduces Bongard-OpenWorld, a benchmark designed to evaluate a system's real-world few-shot reasoning abilities. By incorporating open-world concepts and real images into the classical Bongard Problems, this benchmark serves as a litmus test for current limitations in visual intelligence, motivating further research toward enhancing few-shot reasoning in visual agents. The paper conducts a comprehensive assessment, examining the effectiveness of various Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), as well as proposing a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach tailored for this benchmark.

### Strengths
Overall the paper is well written and provides the reader with good insight on why the availability of the proposed benchmark is good for the community as it promotes research into the few-shot reasoning capabilities of current black box deep learning models. The paper presents a tough benchmark that tests current systems on their ability to reason about free-form concepts in a few-shot manner by identifying the common concept in a positive set and distinguishing it from the negative set. 

The paper introduces a robust benchmark that assesses systems' ability to perform few-shot reasoning on free-form concepts. It challenges models to identify commonalities in positive sets while distinguishing them from negative sets, enhanced by the inclusion of distractors and hard negatives in the dataset curation process. The evaluation framework covers a wide spectrum, encompassing four distinct approaches: few-shot learning, combined LLM+VLM in single and multiple steps, and a novel neuro-symbolic architecture.

The evaluation setup utilized in the paper is comprehensive and includes the evaluation of four different kinds of approaches that include a few shot learning approaches, LLM+VLM in a single step, LLM+VLM in multiple iteration steps, and finally a proposed neuro-symbolic architecture.

### Weaknesses
I would like to look at more variants of the neurosymbolic approach proposed in this work. One avenue worth exploring is a line of research that leverages domain knowledge, such as knowledge graphs, to identify pertinent concepts within an input. Active nodes within the graph could then be employed to pinpoint the common concept within the positive set of images.

The evaluations used in this paper though really comprehensive, miss out on some more ways of evaluation. VLM-based approaches, like GPT4(V), that directly take images as input and can be prompted to obtain the desired input, could be used to identify the relevant concept from a collage of images given together. Since current VLM/LLM approaches are very susceptible to the way they are prompted, it is very important to prompt engineer them in a number of ways and then identify the best working one.

### Questions
Table 2 provides a good overview of the performance of various approaches on the proposed benchmark. I would like to see more explanation of the reasoning behind the performance of these approaches. Like for example, Flamingo/ChatGPT/Otter performs significantly worse than the few-shot learning approach SNAIL despite Flamingo/Otter using the same image encoder. 

Including a section on failure case analysis for different approaches would be instrumental for the readers in identifying specific challenges and guiding improvements for tackling them.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new benchmark called Bongard-OpenWorld, which focuses on open-world visual concept understanding. The task is to classify a query image to belong to one of two sets of images. The positive set contains 6 images depicting a common concept C, such as "animals are running". The negative set contains 6 images of similar concepts but not exactly matching C, e.g., showing a standing animal, or a running robot. The difficulty of this benchmark comes from the two sets sharing common objects or semantics, such that nuances in the semantic concepts need to be understood to perform well. The authors also evaluate relevant existing methods and show that there is still a large gap between current methods and human performance.

### Strengths
- The new benchmark and problem setting tackles an important shortcoming of current methods to understand fine-grained semantic concepts in contrast to hard negatives.
- An extensive set of existing methods have been evaluated showing that the best models (64%) are still far from human performance (91%). This makes it a challenging setting for new methods to be developed in the future.
- Evaluations include a few-shot and zero-shot setting, and several different approaches to combine vision-language models and large language models to solve the task.

### Weaknesses
- The presentation and writing could be clearer, making some parts of the paper difficult to understand, especially around the creation of the dataset in Sec. 2 and the precise problem setting. For example, it was not immediately clear that the labels of the two sets (positive, negative) are given and do not need to be inferred. The query image can belong to either, but the name "positive" suggests that this is the GT set of the query image, which is not the case. I am adding more clarifying questions in the questions section below.
- The problem setting is imbalanced. The positive set corresponds to a single concept while the negative set does not, but instead contains a subset of the complete concept. While this is not necessarily an issue and can be a design choice, there is no justification why this choice has been made. For instance, why not have both sets correspond to a single concept where the contrasting sets are close in semantics to make it a hard problem? Similarly to how different splits are evaluated in Table 2, it would have helped to show the performance of positive query images vs. negative query images in order to understand if this imbalance makes positive/negative queries easier/harder.
- While a lot of models have been evaluated on the proposed benchmark, a natural baseline is missing: computing the image similarity between the query image and the two sets. For instance, one can use any pre-trained image encoder (CLIP, Dino, etc.) or image-to-image retrieval method and use the mean similarly of the image embeddings per set to make a prediction. Using captioning models and LLMs seems to introduce complexity while at the same time discarding fine-grained image information by only relying on text to make the decision.
- With around 1K tasks it is a rather small dataset. Hence, focusing on the "zero-shot" setting without involving training might be the better use case.
- While it is true that the benchmark contains a large variety of concepts, positioning it heavily as an "open-world" and "open-vocabulary" task could be a bit misleading as the core problem is to identify whether an image came from set A or set B. The optional task of naming the concept is most fitting for "open-world", but it serves a minor role in the paper.

### Questions
- Have you thought about not providing the labels "positive" and "negative" for the two sets to the methods? Why have you chosen this setup?
- In Sec 2.1: What is a grid in this context? What is grid sampling? How do you define "concept tuples"? Neither the main paper, nor the supplementary clarifies this sufficiently.
- How do you ensure that the dataset does not contain duplicate concepts? I assume this is the case because in Table 1, it is reported that the dataset has 1.01K concepts and 1.01K tasks.
- What are the exact instructions the annotators were given? For instance, when "annotators are instructed to write visual concepts by following a predefined set of categories illustrated in Table 7" and when "they are also asked to combine these challenging concepts with those mined from CC-3M" (Sec. 2.1).
- Images are collected by using an online search based on the concepts. What is the license of the images collected? Do the authors have the rights to distribute the images?
- In Sec. 2.2. you write: "the annotators are then asked to provide two sets of candidates for positive and negative queries". How many images are collected here for possible query images? Why choose only one positive and negative image as query in the end?
- Does defining the concepts of category 0 (from CC3M) undergo any crowd-sourcing or is it fully automated?
- Is there performance difference between positive and negative queries?
- In Figure 2c, both x and y-axis should be labeled. What is the scale/size of the number of concepts (x-axis)? What is the unit of the numbers on the y-axis?
- What is meant by "we report the overall accuracy of all models". Does Table 2 report test set accuracy or accuracy over the whole dataset, i.e., including training samples?
- Why are concepts from CC3M considered non-commonsense?
- How is ChatGPT finetuned (Table 2)? Does this use the finetuning API of OpenAI? More details would help make this more reproducible.

Comments/suggestions:
- Table 2 includes methods that use training data to update NN weights and others that do not update weights ("zero-shot" setting). It would be much clearer if the table indicates which models use training data.
- The following phrase appears 3 times in the manuscript. I suggest to to reduce this repetition and rephrase it according to the context. "We even designed a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard problems".
- Sec. 3.2 (at the end) promises captioning metrics, but they do not appear in the main paper, only in the supplementary.
- The formatting of Table 7 is confusing. It would be better to clearly separate the left half from the right half, or simply just make it 10 rows.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new benchmark, called Bongard-OpenWorld that contains visual few-shot reasoning tasks. Specifically, a Bongard problem contains a set of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ images in the support set, where the positives all share a concept that none of the negatives do. The goal is to use this ‘context’ to infer the positive ‘concept’ in order to correctly label a disjoint set of query images as being positive or negative. While this problem has been studied in previous work, the proposed benchmark differs in that the concepts are ‘open world’ (rather than selected from a predefined small set). Specifically, they leverage Conceptual Concepts which is a massive web-crawled dataset containing image descriptions, and extract concepts from that dataset as well as through crowd-sourcing, to obtain concepts that contain factual or commonsense knowledge. Then, an image search tool is used to find appropriate images from the web to populate the ‘positives’ and ‘negatives’ for each concept (as well as query images) in order to form Bongard problems. They conduct an empirical investigation using both canonical few-shot learning methods as well as leveraging LMs and VLMs in different ways. For example, they explore a scenario where the VLM produces a caption for each of the images in the support set, and then these captions along with the positive and negative labels are fed to the LM which makes a prediction for each query image via in-context learning. This can be done in one-go or iteratively. They also propose a symbolic approach that directly applies logical operations to infer the positive concept.

### Strengths
- This paper studies the interesting problem of few-shot visual reasoning
- both ‘traditional’ few-shot learning methods as well as newer ideas involving LMs and VLMs are explored
- the finding that even the best approaches lag significantly behind human performance is an interesting one, and points to the proposed benchmark as a valuable one for pushing the boundaries of of existing methods in this important direction

### Weaknesses
- Some related work is missed. [A] (see references below) studies a setting very related to the proposed benchmark (though they didn’t use the terminology Bongard problems). They also created tasks using natural (‘real-world’) images from different datasets, from using computer vision datasets (rather than scraping the web).

- It would be great to add additional few-shot learning baselines to cover families of approaches that are excluded from the current analysis like approaches that perform FiLM-conditioning e.g. [B, C] (see references below) and approaches that train the backbone with gradient descent within each task, like MAML and Proto-MAML (the latter is a version proposed in the Meta-Dataset paper which is cited by this work)

- The paper has some clarity issues, perhaps owing to the fact that the authors tried to ‘squeeze’ a lot of content in the required number of pages. It’s hard to fully understand the different methods by reading only the main paper. I found the neuro-symbolic method proposed especially hard to understand (even after looking at the algorithm in the appendix). Please include some higher-level motivation and the intuition for the particular updates that it entails.

- In Table 2, it’s hard to tell which methods / rows correspond to which of the families of approaches (e.g. a, b, c, or d in Figure 3) – and e.g. which are single-round or multi-round. Perhaps a good way of indicating this is by adding an extra column in that table.

- It would be great to conduct ablation analyses for design choices made in creating the benchmark, like the adversarial query selection that picks the positive query to not be too close to the prototype of the positive class. 

- It would be great to conduct an analysis of the effect of the ‘shot’ on these problems. Intuitively, the more positive and negative images the network sees, the easier it is to infer what is the positive class and correctly label query images. Given the negative results in the paper with the current number of shots (6 positives and 6 negatives), in terms of the very large gap from human performance, have the authors considered increasing the number of shots? Understanding how performance of different methods differs as the number of shots increases would be insightful.

- it would also strengthen the paper to tie in the findings of this work with findings in related works. E.g. in the Bongard-HOI benchmark that the authors claim is the most similar, do they have similar findings e.g. in terms of which methods perform better?


Minor
=====
- ‘given 6 positive and 6 negative images [...] (see Figure 1 for illustration)’ – but Figure 1 shows only 3 positive and 3 negative images (6 in total, not each). Maybe clarify that Figure 1 doesn’t correspond to that setting and is used for illustration only? Or describe the task in the intro at a higher level of abstraction, e.g. P positive and N negative images.
- in the caption of Figure 1, highlight ‘hard negatives’ in orange, like ‘distractors’ are highlighted in green, to match the (captions of the) images shown in that figure.
- typo: “prob” → “probe” (on page 6)
- typo: “was not fine-tuning” → “was not fine-tuned” (in Table 2’s caption)

### Questions
- In Table 1, how is the number of tasks computed? What constitutes a unique task? Would having the same set of classes but different images in the support set count as the same task?

- In Fig 3a, different few-shot learning algorithms are shown for the classification head only which seemed surprising. Some of these are meta-learning methods that also update the backbone. Is there a meta-training phase (starting possibly from a pretrained architecture) during which the backbone is also finetuned?

- the authors mention that all few-shot learners excluding ChatGPT and GPT-4 use a ConvNext-base. But they also mention that SNAIL uses a transformer architecture. Should SNAIL be listed as another exception there?

- The authors claim that open vocabulary is important for this benchmark and they use this as a  justification for the fact that pretraining on larger datasets leads to better results (“few-shot learners fueled with proper open-ended pretrained models [...] can alleviate this gap”). But an alternative explanation could be that such large pretrained models like CLIP have already seen the specific images and / or concepts presented in the few-shot learning task and thus they simply face a weaker generalization challenge compared to models that were trained on smaller training set which may have a smaller probability of having seen these exact images or concepts. Have the authors made an attempt to examine or rule out this alternative hypothesis?  

- Is it possible that some of the created Bongard problems are not solvable? E.g. this could happen if there accidentally is more than one concept that is shared between all of the positive images and none of the negative images. Is care taken to avoid this?
