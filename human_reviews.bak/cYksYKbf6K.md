# Imagine Within Practice: Conservative Rollout Length Adaptation for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms achieve high sample efficiency by leveraging imagined rollouts from a world model for policy optimization. A crucial hyperparameter in MBRL is the rollout length, which represents a trade-off between data quality and efficiency by limiting the imaginary horizon. While longer rollout length offers enhanced efficiency, it introduces more unrealistic data due to compounding error, potentially leading to catastrophic performance deterioration. To prevent significant deviations between imagined rollouts and real transitions, most model-based methods manually tune a fixed rollout length for the entire training process. However, the fixed rollout length is not optimal for all rollouts and does not effectively prevent the generation of unrealistic data. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method called Conservative Rollout Length Adaptation (CRLA), which conservatively restricts the agent from selecting actions that are rarely taken in the current state. CRLA truncates the rollout to preserve safety when there is a high probability of selecting infrequently taken actions. We apply our method to DreamerV3 and evaluate it on the Atari 100k benchmark. The results demonstrate that CRLA can effectively balance data quality and efficiency by adjusting rollout length and achieve significant performance gains in most Atari games compared to DreamerV3 in the default setting.

### Summary
This paper proposed a model-based RL method, called CRLA, to tune the rollout length in model-based RL settings adaptively. To achieve this, CRLA truncates the rollout while the agents tend to select an infrequently taken action. Then, the authors introduced  CRLA to dreamerV3 and conducted several experiments on the Atari 100 benchmark. Some empirical results in the Atari 100k benchmark demonstrated the effectiveness of CRLA.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The method is concise and clear, and the proposed problem is indeed one of the challenges in current Model-Based RL.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 4 shows that the rollout length will generally decrease in the late training stage in most tasks. It can be seen here that CRLA seems to be able to avoid excessively long rollout, but it does not seem easy to see whether CRLA can adaptively trade-off the rollout since few experiments show that CRLA knows when to increase the trajectory length.
2. In the experiment in Figure 4, CRLA achieves performance beyond fixed length on only about half of the tasks. This may be not enough to support the effectiveness and significance of CRLA.
3. The author does not appear to have provided the code, so reproducibility may be difficult to guarantee.

### Questions
1. While CRLA early stops those harmful trajectories, will some promising trajectories be truncated as well? For example, in Ms Pacman, CRLA seems to be outperformed by some fixed rollout length methods.
2. CRLA may be able to avoid the cumulative errors caused by longer trajectories, but CRLA may also cause some good exploration trajectories to be terminated early, which may be harmful. Hopefully, the author can alleviate this concern.

### Summary
This paper aims to dynamically adjust a crucial hyperparameter in model-based RL, the rollout horizon. They introduce the Conservative Rollout Length Adaptation (CRLA), which trains a policy network to predict the practiced action distribution, thereby limiting the agent's choice of out-of-distribution actions during the rollout process and dynamically adjusting the rollout horizon according to the distance between the conservator's prediction and the current policy's prediction. Experimental results on the Atari environment indicate that CRLA can outperform Dreamerv3 on several tasks.

### Strengths
1. Dynamically adjusting the rollout horizon is a very interesting and crucial topic for model-based RL. This can significantly improve the time efficiency of MBRL algorithms.
2. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Whether in state-based model-based RL or visual-based model-based RL, linearly increasing the rollout horizon with the increase in environment steps has already become a standard practice (MBPO [1], TDMPC [2]). This is not as the paper claims in the abstract, ''To prevent significant deviations between imagined rollouts and real transitions, most model-based methods manually tune a fixed rollout length for the entire training process.'' Therefore, I believe the paper should provide experimental results and analysis on DreamerV3 with a linearly adjusted rollout horizon. If the performance is good, I don't see the necessity of dynamically adjusting the rollout horizon since this requires training a conservator, which will bring additional time and computational resource consumption.

2. In state-based MBRL, there are already many methods that have attempted to address the issue of model compounding error caused by an overly long rollout horizon. These methods can be directly applied to visual-based MBRL, such as discarding samples with excessively large errors (M2AC [3]) and learning a world model that is more accurate for the current policy (PDML [4]). I believe these should all be baselines for this paper, yet the paper only provides the original results from DreamerV3.

3. One advantage of the latent world model is that there is no need to explicitly predict the next observation. Instead, transitions are performed in the latent space, which to some extent avoids model error. In the abstract, this paper claims, "While longer rollout length offers enhanced efficiency, it introduces more unrealistic data due to compounding error, potentially leading to catastrophic performance deterioration." However, no references are cited, and no experimental evidence is provided. This weakens the motivation of the paper.

4. The method proposed in this paper can only be used in discrete action environments (Atari) and is not applicable to continuous control tasks, which significantly limits the practicality of the method.

5. Based on Figure 7, the method proposed in this paper does not show significant performance improvement, and in many environments, it even harms performance.

### Questions
1. I am very curious whether, in the latent space, there will indeed be unrealistic samples due to long rollouts that affect policy performance, just as in state-based MBRL methods. Based on this question, I also doubt whether the theoretical analysis from MBPO in Section 3.3 can be used to analyze DreamerV3.
2. Why does the rollout horizon in Figure 4 start long at the beginning of training and become shorter as training progresses? This is counter-intuitive. In the early stages of training, when the model is not very accurate, it should use short horizon rollouts. As the model learning progresses and becomes more accurate, the rollout horizon should gradually lengthen. I hope the paper can provide a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon.
3. Why does the performance curve for DreamerV3 only have 5 seeds, while the method proposed in this paper has 10 seeds? I believe this is not reasonable. Additionally, in Figures 4 and 7, the horizontal axis scales for DreamerV3 and the proposed method are not aligned, which can also influence the performance comparison.
4. Introducing the conservator will lead to additional training overhead. Can the paper provide a comparison of training time with Dreamer V3?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to adaptively choose rollout length for model-rollouts model-based reinforcement learning to avoid compounding errors. The key idea is to learn a “conservator” that approximates the probability of distribution of action taken by the historical policy and then use the Jenson-Shannon divergence between the action selection distribution and the conservator to cut off the rollout when there is a large discrepancy. Empirical results on Atari100K benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
The paper is very well-written. The proposed algorithm is very well-motivated and easy to follow. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive (at least for tasks with discrete action spaces), with both quantitative and qualitative results. I appreciate the authors for providing a specific example on Ms Pacman to demonstrate how CRLA works.

### Weaknesses
Because the proposed method only works for environments with discrete action space, it becomes a major limitation that it cannot be applied to continuous control tasks. 
Additionally, the performance improvement of the proposed approach is actually not quite significant based on the learning curve provided in Figure 7.

### Questions
1. The “Theoretical Analysis” section should better be named as Intuition or Theoretical Intuition since no rigorous analysis is provided, and it only explains the intuition of why cutting off the rollout based on disagreement between conservator and the policy. 
Besides, it is based on the results of MBPO, which learns a dynamics model directly on the observation space, not a latent dynamics model. 
2. Why does the rollout length get smaller towards the end of training based on Figure 4? Intuitively, as the dynamics model gets more accurate, it should be able to conduct longer rollouts. But for CRLA, the rollout length gets smaller throughout the training progress.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach for learning adaptive rollout lengths in model-based reinforcement learning, called "Conservative Rollout Length Adaptation" (CRLA). CRLA adjusts the length of model rollouts by truncating them if, at any given step, the policy significantly deviates from the action distribution in the training data, measured by Jensen–Shannon divergence. The method trains neural network, named “*conservator”*, on real transition data within the replay buffer to predict the action distribution. The truncation is triggered when the aforementioned divergence surpasses a predetermined threshold, at any step during the model rollout. Upon application to DreamerV3, CRLA has demonstrated performance enhancements on the Atari 100k benchmark.

### Strengths
- Outperforms the baseline on Atari 100k benchmark
- Adaptive model rollout horizon is relevant to a wide variety of MBRL methods and the proposed approach is straightforward

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluation is insufficient to assess the efficacy of the method: the approach is tested exclusively on the Atari 100k benchmark. It demonstrates a performance increase in 16 out of 28 games while underperforming in the remaining 12. Also, the threshold alpha is considered “crucial”, which is set heuristically. It remains to see whether such an approach is robust across varied environments.

2. Limited applicability: as pointed out in the paper, the approach is restricted to discrete action spaces, which narrows its applicability, especially when compared to the baseline DreamerV3 that accommodates both discrete and continuous actions. 

3. Maybe I’m missing something, but I do not see why “Our method is computationally simpler compared to previous methods”.  Despite being conceptually straightforward, the method requires running a complete rollout up to the maximum length before any truncation occurs. Could you elaborate on the computational saving? 

4. The presentation could be enhanced for better readability: the detailed exposition of the theorem from [Janner et. al 2019] seems to add limited value. One can simply mention the core components of the bound on the return of branched imagined rollouts and how they connect to the proposed method. 

5. The rollout length is constrained inside an interval [5,16]. I wonder how would a random baseline for setting rollout length perform. Please also see the Question section below.

Minor:

- it is better to add supporting reference for this claim: “Previous works have found that even small model errors can be compounded by multi-step rollout and deviate the predicted state from the region where the model has high accuracy.” in Section 5.
- Typo in Sec 4.3: “, Our method” → “, our method”.

### Questions
1. How to set the interval of rollout length in practice?

2. I am curious about the performance of a simple random baseline where the rollout length is set randomly (say, uniformly), from the given range. Could the authors add it?
