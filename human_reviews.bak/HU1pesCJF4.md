# Pixel Reweighted Adversarial Training

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Adversarial training (AT) is a well-known defensive framework that trains a model with generated adversarial examples (AEs). AEs are crafted by intentionally adding perturbations to the natural images, aiming to mislead the model into making erroneous outputs. In existing AT methods, the magnitude of perturbations is usually constrained by a predefined perturbation budget, denoted as $\epsilon$, and keeps the same on each dimension of the image (i.e., each pixel within an image). However, in this paper, we discover that not all pixels contribute equally to the accuracy on AEs (i.e., robustness) and accuracy on natural images (i.e., accuracy). Motivated by this finding, we propose a new framework called Pixel-reweighted AdveRsarial Training (PART), to partially lower $\epsilon$ for pixels that rarely influence the model's outputs, which guides the model to focus more on regions where pixels are important for model's outputs. Specifically, we first use class activation mapping (CAM) methods to identify important pixel regions, then we keep the perturbation budget for these regions while lowering it for the remaining regions when generating AEs. In the end, we use these reweighted AEs to train a model. PART achieves a notable improvement in the robustness-accuracy trade-off on CIFAR-10, SVHN and Tiny-ImageNet and serves as a general framework, seamlessly integrating with a variety of AT, CAM and AE generation methods. More importantly, our work revisits the conventional AT framework and justifies the necessity to allocate distinct weights to different pixel regions during AT.

### Summary
This paper introduces Pixel-reweighted AdveRsarial Training (PART), a novel framework within Adversarial Training (AT). It focuses on optimizing the perturbation budget ε by assigning higher allocations to pixels crucial for the model's performance and lower allocations to less influential ones. PART shows improved model robustness and accuracy compared to existing defenses. This performance enhancement is observed across datasets such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet, even in the face of diverse attack strategies, including adaptive ones.

### Strengths
The paper introduces an original approach in Adversarial Training (AT) by addressing perturbation budgets and proposing Pixel-reweighted AdveRsarial Training (PART), offering a fresh perspective on adversarial defense. It maintains a solid research quality with a well-defined methodology, rigorous experiments, and comprehensive result documentation. Besides, this paper effectively communicates its problem formulation, methodology, and results, ensuring clear presentation.

### Weaknesses
1. The introduced CAM technology seems to have a weak improvement in robustness, and the authors did not analyze the impact on the training speed of the original AT framework, so I think it is not clear whether the performance trade-off brought by CAM is worth the cost of training speed and memory;
2. The authors mentioned that in the process of AT, it actually needs to be combined with standard AT for warm-up. I think they should specify the number of training sessions required for AT and PRAG during training;
3. The CAM technique seems to be a visualization technique for problems based on classification, which may limit the applicability of the PART framework proposed by the authors on other applications besides classification.
4. The authors’ description of the results in the figures and tables is not clear enough. For example, some of the tables seem to have standard deviations, while some do not. The authors didn't mention how many runs the standard deviation was calculated; The typography of the font, shadows, and content in the table are not compact enough.
5. Authors should probably consider more AT methods using CAM techniques mentioned in related works for comparison, instead of using many experimental results to compare different CAM techniques, since these techniques including naive CAM techniques seem to be existing
6. The authors do not seem to consider the impact of the number of attack iterations on the robustness in the results of white-box attack defense, such as the performance of PGD-10/50 and other attacks. In fact, the number of attacks may also have an important impact on the role of CAM technology.

### Questions
1. Regarding the use of CAM technology, can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of its impact on training speed and memory consumption when integrated with the original AT framework? Are the performance gains achieved through CAM technology worth the potential trade-offs?
2. The paper mentions combining standard AT for warm-up during training. Could the authors specify the number of training sessions required for both AT and PRAG in this process? How does this affect the training performance?
3. CAM technology appears to be a visualization technique primarily applicable to classification problems. How can the authors address concerns about the limited applicability of the PART framework in domains beyond classification? Are there plans to extend its use to other areas?
4. The clarity of results presentation is a concern. Could the authors provide more information about how standard deviations were calculated and specify the number of runs used in this calculation? 
5. Instead of comparing various CAM techniques, could the authors consider comparing the PART framework with a broader range of AT methods that utilize CAM technology, thereby offering a more comprehensive comparison of its effectiveness?
6. White-box attack defense results are discussed, but the impact of the number of attack iterations on the performance of CAM technology isn't addressed. Can the authors provide insights into how the number of attack iterations influences the effectiveness of CAM technology in adversarial defense?

### Summary
This submission proposes pixel-wise reweighting for adversarial training. The central observation presented in this work is that not all pixels of the adversarial perturbation contribute equally to the accuracy of the model. The authors propose a new framework for adversarial training called pixel-reweighed adversarial training (PART) which uses class activation mapping to identify important pixel regions. Authors evaluate their adversarial training framework on the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using a ResNet 
and a WideResNet model.

### Strengths
- The paper presents theoretical results on a toy model which help understanding the method.
- The empirical evaluation is solid and the proposed PART method is compared against vanilla adversarial training, TRADES, and MART.
- The paper reads mostly very well and is very understandable. I only found a few typos (see below).

### Weaknesses
- The idea is not completely novel. Adversarial attacks in combination with class activation mappings have for example been discussed in [1]. However, the authors use it for robustifying their models which is in my opinion sufficiently different. Nonetheless, authors should include a citation of that work.
- The empirical evaluation can be extended by using different adversarial attacks, e.g., Carlini-Wagner attack or AutoAttack.
- The literature review seems somewhat short. I suggest authors spend more time looking for relevant related works.
- Performence of the PART method is somewhat underwhelming. The improvement is only incremental (usually only in the range of ~1%).
- Section 3.1 “AE generation process.” is tough to read. Authors should work on the presentation of that section. Maybe a small table on the side would help to introduce the notation.
- Figure 4: Authors should mention what is indicated by the shaded areas.

Overall, the ideas in this paper are not ground-breaking, but the solid theoretical and empirical analysis justify its publication in ICLR, which is why I recommend to accept this submission.

Minor details: 
- Missing whitespace “Table 2: Robustness(%) of…”
- Eq. 12-15 “subject to” should not be typeset in math mode
- Lemma 1: “(i).” unusual period

### Summary
The paper presents Pixel-reweighted Adversarial Training (PART), a adjusted adversarial training framework designed to enhance model robustness against adversarial attacks. PART introduces a dynamic perturbation allocation strategy, redistributing the perturbation across pixels according to their influence on model output. This is a departure from traditional AT methods, which apply a uniform noise across all pixels. It tested on the common benchmarks to proof that such reweighted perturbation enhances model performance by allowing the model to focus on more critical areas of the image that significantly impact model decisions.

### Strengths
This paper takes a step further on the adversarial training. The concept of pixel influence on robustness and accuracy is well-motivated, grounded on the premise that not all parts of an image equally contribute to the decision-making process of a neural network. Overall, the paper is easy to follow. 

The authors conducted experiments on common benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, SVHN and Tiny-ImageNet. Extensive results show the proposed PART generally outperforms standard AT.

### Weaknesses
I am not surprised by the proposed method that introducing CAM to direction adversarial training to the semantic meaningful regions. 

Also, I am unsure if the proposed method can be scaled up --- due to (1) CAM may not be scalable which means it may lose the ability to identify the semantic meaningful regions; (2) the author currently did not analyze the computation cost and training time cost of the proposed PART compared to AT and standard training.

# Post-rebuttal

I raised my score due to author provide more detailed comparisons. However, I am unsure if the proposed framework can be scale-up or not. Hope AC can examine this point.

### Questions
I would be curious if the proposed method applied into larger dataset which also obtains improvements.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new framework of pixel-based re-weighting to gauge a more robust way of adversarial training. Authors begin with a proof of concept example showing how not all part of an image are equally informative, and then proceed to create an automated pipeline for adversarial training that can generalize and extend to multiple images based on gradient-based methods that show what parts of the image activate a certain class the most (parts that will later be weight more aggressively for the attack). Authors finish the paper with additional quantitative plots. I wish authors would have shown at the end how their adversarial images for networks trained on PART look like.

### Strengths
* The paper introduces a way to improve adversarial robustness through part-based re-weighting given the interesting parts of information in an image.
* Authors propose a modular framework that can be used for future adversarial training pipelines.
* Authors show how PART is better than many other adversarial training pipelines but the increase is very incremental. Should the paper be accepted because of this last point? I am not entirely convinced.

### Weaknesses
* The paper says towards the end that this framework in more aligned to human perception. I don't think this is true from what has been shown in the paper. I would have liked to see qualitative samples and attack comparing how PGD performs on the same network trained differently (without AT, and with AT either classical or PART based), and from there run a psychophysical experiment with human observers to see if indeed they are fooled more by the PART-based model. While running the psychophysical experiments may not be possible, even adding the resulting adversarial images from networks trained with PART would be a great addition to the paper.

* I'd really recommend plotting the adversarial images for networks trained on PART similar to how this was done in Santurkar et al. (NeurIPS 2019), Berrios & Deza (ArXiv 2022) and Gaziv et al. (NeurIPS 2023).

### Questions
I think this paper is interesting but I am on fence of the contribution. Are all pixels equally important in an image? My gut feeling says that the answer is No, and perhaps it's a bit of a tautology (this seems quite obvious). Would it not be possible that performing adversarial training end-to-end with PGD-based type image diets automatically help a neural network find these critical parts in the image from which to then perturb the image at training? All-in-all, my question is: is PART really useful when there are many other adversarial training regimes that go beyond FGSM and that implicitly incorporate the image structure in the adversarial optimization?

I am not an expert in the adversarial robustness literature, so I am curious to hear what other reviewers say about this proposed training framework. I am willing to change my mind depending on the rebuttal and on knowing what the other reviews have to say about this paper.

Perhaps another interesting question that I would have liked authors answer is. How would PART work with training on other image distributions such as Textures or Scenes? Would PART be equally useful or will it only apply to objects?
