## Abstract
In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which
makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically
grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by
incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation.

### Summary
This paper proposes a general framework for incorporating unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. This paper shows that the unbalanced Monge map corresponds to the Monge map (from OT) between the reweighted source and target distributions. The proposed framework is to introduce existing Monge map estimator into these reweighted distributions. These reweighted distributions are estimated through the minibatch UOT estimator.

### Strengths
-	This work is overall well-written.
-	This paper proposes a general framework for extending existing OT Monge maps estimators into unbalanced cases.
-	This paper shows that the introduction of unbalancedness improves the performance of existing OT Monge map estimators in unpaired domain translation tasks.

### Weaknesses
-	**W1.** The main Prop 3.1-1, which provides the justification for the proposed general framework, was proved in [1] (The proof is different).
-	**W2.** The performance is only compared with the OT-counterpart and not with other UOT Monge maps estimators.

### Questions
-	**Q1.** What is the definition of $\tau$ in Prop 3.1? Is it the same $\tau$ in Appendix B?
-	**Q2.** What is the reason for better performance of UOT compared to OT? This paper suggest that this improvement is primarily attributed to the discrepancy in the number of samples for each corresponding cluster, e.g. $8 \leftrightarrow B$ in Fig 1. If the number of samples were similar, would the performance of UOT be comparable to OT?
-	**Q3.** The proposed framework is to optimize the OT Monge map on the estimated reweighted distribution. How does the performance of the proposed framework change according to the minibatch UOT coupling estimates, such as minibatch size and $\epsilon$ of entropic regularization, in terms of quantitative results?
- **Typo**  $\phi^{\*} (x) d \mu (x) \rightarrow \phi^{\*}(y) d \nu (y)$ in Eq (2)

### Summary
This paper studies the methodological aspect of optimal transport (OT) under the practical application scenarios for domain translation, e.g., the mass proportion is imbalanced for different domains. The main pursuit is to approximately estimate the dual OT distance via the neural networks with significant capacity and provide an explicit retrieval form for the OT plan/map. To overcome the limitation in marginal distribution conservation, this paper introduces unbalanced OT to obtain a relaxed plan and then recovers the balanced OT from a reweighting view. Theoretical results are provided to connect the re-weighted OT and UOT and ensure the feasibility of recovering the Monge map from neural UOT. Experiments are conducted from several perspectives, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ This paper is well-written and easy to follow; necessary justifications and discussions are provided around the technical parts.
+ The proposed method is well-motivated and reasonable; the main difficulty stated in introduction is properly addressed with the proposed method and theoretical analysis.
+ Diverse experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method from different perspectives and tasks, where the results are generally convincible.

### Weaknesses
- Some related concepts and fields are omitted, which should also be discussed appropriately.
- The limitations of the proposed method should be discussed.
- The experiments can be enhanced by considering more practical and challenging problems.

### Questions
1. As far as I understand this paper, the basic goal is to address the potential mismatch induced by the imbalanced weights of different domains; more precisely, the imbalance means the mass proportion of the ideal transport pairs is different. Such a scenario is also analogous to the label shift problem, which is usually considered in OT methodology. To address this problem, there are two natural and common solutions: relaxation (i.e., UOT) or reweighting (i.e., adjusting the marginal distribution) [r1, r2]. Since this work adopts relaxation as a solution (while also noting that the idea of reweighting is also implicitly shown in Sec. 3.1), I think more justification and discussion on the related fields are highly expected.

2. Based on the reweighting solution mentioned above, can the imbalanced mass problem be addressed by detecting the degree of shifting mass (i.e., estimating the weights in Sec. 3.1) and solving the reweighting (balanced) OT? If it is feasible, what will be the advantages and weaknesses of the proposed methods?

3. As the basic problem is similar to label shift, the experiments on related problems are highly appreciated. For example, the generalized label shift scenario [r1] and partial domain adaptation [r2] (which can be taken as an extreme scenario for label shift), where the comparison methods for corresponding tasks should also be carefully considered.

4. Minor points:

4.1) Page 3, typo in the reweighting formulation of $\tilde{\nu}$ in Sec. 3.1.

4.2) Point 2 in Prop. 3.1, the definition of $\mathcal{L}_d$ is not provided.

### Summary
The paper explores the role of introducing unbalancedness into neural Monge maps within the framework of optimal transport (OT). The authors investigate whether this unbalancedness can enhance the performance of unpaired domain translation tasks.

- Complexity: Introducing unbalancedness into neural Monge maps could add computational or conceptual complexity, which may not be fully addressed in the paper.
- Dependency on Empirical Validation: While the paper does include empirical validation, its contributions could be further strengthened with more diverse datasets or a broader set of real-world applications.

### Summary
The paper introduces unbalancedness into any balanced Monge map estimator based on optimal transport (OT). Moreover, it demonstrates, both theoretically and experimentally, that this can enhance the performance of unpaired domain translation tasks.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well writing and is well organized, and proposed method is well-motivated and effective.
2. This work innovatively integrates unbalanced optimal transport into the existing Monge map estimator, achieving competitive results in various domain translation generative tasks.
3. Sufficient theoretical and experimental evidence is provided in the main paper and appendix.

### Weaknesses
1. In the single-cell trajectory inference and image translation experiments in Sections 5.1 and 5.3 (Table 1, 2, and 4), the article compared the performance of OT and unbalanced OT. Were there comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods?
2. The experiments in Table 3 on the CelebA dataset show that the proposed method performs suboptimally FID score in comparison to UVCGAN [1], which was introduced in 2022. Further explanation is required to address this disparity.
3. OT-FM [2] has conducted numerous experiments in image generation tasks and outperforms many GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. Have you considered experimenting with UOT-FM on the same tasks for further validation of the method's effectiveness?
