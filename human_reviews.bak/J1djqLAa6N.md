# Efficient Score Matching with Deep Equilibrium Layers

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Score matching methods -- estimate probability densities without computing the normalization constant -- are particularly useful in deep learning. However, computational and memory costs of score matching methods can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data or complex models, particularly due to the derivatives or Hessians of the log density function appearing in the objective function. Some existing approaches modify the objective function to reduce the quadratic computational complexity for Hessian computation. However, the memory bottleneck of score matching methods remains for deep learning. This study improves the memory efficiency of score matching by leveraging deep equilibrium models. We provide a theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach enables the development of deep and expressive models with improved performance and comparable computational and memory costs over shallow architectures.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel score-matching method that uses deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) to overcome the memory bottleneck usually associated to score-matching.

The main contributions of the paper are the proposed method involving DEQs, a theoretical analysis involving implicit differentiation for higher-order derivatives, and an empirical validation that compares the DEQ model with some other methods for solving score-matching problems, like sliced score-matching.

The theoretical analysis consists of two propositions. The first proposition is concerned with computing the first and second derivatives of the solution mapping of the fixed point equation used in the DEQ and these formulas involve inverting a matrix (typical for implicit differentiation methods). The second proposition is focused on approximating the derivatives of the solution mapping formulated in Proposition 1 without inverting any matrices, by using a truncated Neumann series approximation.

**Edit: after the rebuttal by the authors, the assumptions on the types of activation functions considered have been strengthened and my doubts about the theoretical contributions have been addressed. I therefore raise my soundness score and overall score to a 6.**

The empirical validation is split into four parts, each centered around a task that can be solved by score-matching methods. In each of these tasks the frugality with respect to memory is validated without showing loss in accuracy - the plots suggest that the most accurate methods in terms of various metrics (Frechet Inception Distance, slice score-matching loss, ELBO, etc) is often the DEQ method, although it is not often the fastest method nor is it always the most memory frugal.

### Strengths
The novelty and empirical validation of the claims in the paper seem worthwhile. I don't know of any methods that combine DEQs with score matching, although DEQs and the phantom gradient method of section 3 are already well-known and studied in the papers that introduced them. It is also clear from the numerical experiments that this performs well empirically and that the memory overhead is not so large, especially compared to augmented sliced score matching methods.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical parts of the paper are not correct.

For instance in proposition 1 it is required that the function f_theta is continuously differentiable; this is not the case for the ReLU and will necessitate a non-smooth implicit function theorem (see, e.g., [Bolte 2021]). There even appears the second derivative of f_theta but this is not compatible with the stated assumptions.

Then in Proposition 2 there is no justification that z* is going to be twice differentiable (and in the examples using ReLU, it might not even be differentiable). If f_theta is continuously differentiable then one can use the implicit function theorem to show that z* is continuously differentiable in a nieghborhood (assuming an invertibility condition holds on the partial derivatives, which will as you are assuming a contractive mapping) but this does not give twice differentiability of the solution map z*.

I find these to be major gaps in the theoretical analysis that do not appear to be trivial or easily fixed.

Small inconsistency: It is written “Given most activation functions, such as ReLU and Softplus used in equation 5 are contractive,” but this is not correct, the ReLU is not contractive (its Lipschitz constant is 1).

### Questions
Are there any conditions you can impose on f_theta that will ensure that z* is twice differentiable that don't also rule out using non-smooth functions like ReLU in the DEQ?

DEQs and the phantom gradient method in section 3 are already well-known, what is the contribution here besides plugging them into score-matching?

### Summary
**Edit: Score increased after rebuttal.**

This paper proposes the use of deep equilibrium layers (DEQs) for the task of score-matching. The motivation for doing this is that score-matching techniques are typically expensive (in both time and memory) as they require computing gradients and/or Hessians of the model, due to the need to store the entire computational graph in memory for backprop. In contrast, DEQ methods do not need to store the entire computational graph. In Section 3, Propositions 1 and 2 give results on several derivatives needed to train score-based models with DEQ layers. Section 4 provides a fairly thorough empirical evaluation of the proposed methods across a variety of tasks, including density estimation and generative modeling. The proposed methods generally show comparable or better performance than the baselines, with low memory costs.

### Strengths
- Score-matching techniques are a fairly hot topic, and this paper aims to solve an important issue with these models, namely their high memory costs.
- The experimental methodology is generally sound, and the provided evidence generally supports the claims made throughout the paper.
- The proposed method shows consistently favorable performance in comparison with the considered baselines, while still retaining lower memory costs.
- To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to use DEQs in the context of score-matching for density estimation tasks.

### Weaknesses
- The main weakness of the paper is that the technical contribution of the paper is somewhat limited. In particular, the authors apply standard DEQ modeling techniques to the task of score-matching. While this combination is novel, the techniques are a relatively straightforward application of existing DEQ methodology. Moreover, DEQ models in the context of diffusion models has been previously explored [2].
- It was unclear in some places what was novel in this work and what has been derived previously. For instance, in Proposition 1, Equation 8 has certainly already appeared in the DEQ literature (Theorem 1 of [1]), but it was unclear to me if the second-order results (Equation 9) was novel. Similarly, Proposition 2 (at least in part) appears in [3], and it was not entirely clear to me what aspects of this were novel.
- The results in Section 4.2.1 were a little confusing to me.
     - What exactly are DSM, CP, and SSM referring to in Table 2? My understanding is that these rows correspond to some version of the DKEF model fit with these score-matching techniques, but the details were unclear. 
     - Moreover, the acronym "CP" is used here before it is introduced later in the paper. 
     - I would have also expected Table 2 to include memory usage (similar to Table 3) as this is one of the key motivations for the proposed method.
     - The description of DKEF itself was also unclear -- what is $q_0$? Where are the learnable parameters $\theta$ appearing?
- Given that there exists previous work on DEQ diffusion models [2], I might have expected a comparison with the methods in [2] in Section 4.4, or at least some rationale for not doing so.

### Minor Comments
- In Section 4.1, "encoder" should be $q_\phi(z | x)$ and "decoder" should be $p_\theta(x | z)$
- Typo in the caption of Figure 3: "momory" should be "memory"

In general, I found this paper to be well-motivated with thorough and convincing empirical results, but perhaps limited in its novelty.

### Summary
Training models with score matching objective can be computationally expensive as it involves computation of higher-order derivatives like Hessian. Therefore, alternate objectives like sliced score matching (SSM) and denoising score matching (DSM) were proposed.

This work proposes to use deep equilibrium model (DEQ)-based architectures to train networks with different score matching objectives in order to reduce the memory requirements. DEQs use implicit gradients which reduce the memory footprint of backward pass as it does not require creation of an explicit computation graph for all the layers of the network. However, computing implicit gradients for DEQs need  matrix inversion. This work uses phantom gradients to circumvent matrix inversion. 

The benefits of using DEQ-based architecture for SSM and DSM has been shown on different density estimation tasks with NICE and deep kernel exponential family (DKEF) models. Further, benefits of using this architecture is also shown for generative modeling with VAEs and NCSN. Overall, the experiments show that using DEQs leads to lower ELBO and test SSM loss, as well as reduced memory requirements.

### Strengths
As indicated by results in Figure 1-5 and Tables 1-5, DEQs outperform or match the performance of non-weight tied architectures for optimizing with SSM objectives on density estimation tasks involving NICE and DKEF architectures, as well as on score estimation for VAEs and NCSN. Further, they consistently have lower memory footprint. The plots also seem to indicate that DEQ converge faster and have lower training and test loss, while matching or outperforming perceptual quality of generated images in terms of FID.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is very sparse on various implementation details of DEQ. Some of the important details that are missing are:
    - The choice of fixed point solver is unclear. From the code shared in the supplementary, it seems like fixed point iterations were used. However, there are other fixed point solver methods (e.g. Newton methods, Anderson acceleration, Jacobi, Gauss-Siedel etc.) that can converge faster, and it is unclear why simple fixed point iterations were preferred over these other faster methods. I presume that memory footprint could be one of the reasons. The reasoning behind various design and implementation should be explicitly stated. Further, for each task, the number of fixed point iterations should be stated as this is an important hyper parameter. 
    - The original work on phantom gradients (Geng et al. 2022) implements these gradients as a convex combination with parameter $\lambda$ i.e. $z^\star = \lambda f(z^\star, x) + (1 - \lambda) z^\star$. However, it seems that this paper doesn’t follow this as per Algorithm 1. Is there an empirical evidence of optimality for the choice of  $\lambda=1$? Further, the paper also skips on values of hyper parameter $K$ used for phantom gradients for different tasks and datasets.
    - The paper is very sparse on implementation details of different network architectures. In general, choice of g(y) in Equation 5 is unclear for different model architectures for instance in Table 7. Similarly, DEQ architectural details, especially choice of g(y) are missing for other architectures.
- There is limited empirical analysis on the nature of convergence for different architectures. We don’t know how convergent the fixed points are and if there are additional benefits of using additional test-time iterations of the DEQ architecture to squeeze improved test-time performance. It will useful to report the final values of the absolute difference between consecutive iterates of DEQ $\|| z^{t} - f(z^{t}, x)\||_2$ or relative difference measure as $\frac{\|| f(z^t, x) - z^t \||_2} {\|| z^t\||_2}$. Even reporting the final values of these quantities at $z^\star$ is useful.
- In the discussion in Section 3.2, it is important to point that most of the practical DEQs are not globally convergent — neither uniqueness not existence of the fixed point is guaranteed--- and thus they are not well-posed. This applies to the DEQs used in this work as well. Further, it is possible to converge to limit cycles as noted in [2][3]. This is the motivation behind deep equilibrium models like MonDEQs [1] which have explicit guarantees on uniqueness and existence of a fixed point.
- This paper derives closed form expressions for second order implicit gradients used for backprop in DEQ, but empirical analysis of stability and performance of these second order implicit gradients is missing. 
- Scalability analysis for score matching is missing. As DEQs have constant memory requirements, these models should be more scalable compared to non-weight tied models as the dimension of data increases. It would be useful to recreate a figure similar to Figure 2 in Song et al. 2020 [4].
- I am not sure if a fair comparison is being made between non weight-tied and DEQ models across all the tasks. Ideally, one should equalize either for the number of parameters or FLOPs. However, these numbers are not included for all the tasks/results in the experiments section.

### Questions
1. Could the authors clarify which tasks in the experiments sections use a DEQ model that needs computation of Hessian? As far as I can tell, only DKEF trained on UCI datasets uses the original score matching loss. Besides this, all other tasks use sliced score matching (SSM) loss or denoising score matching loss, both of which do require computation of Hessians. In that case, could the authors state the memory requirements of the networks in Table 2. Also, could the authors add these numbers for SSM and SSM with variance reduction (SSM-VR) in Table 2? 
2. There are several missing details in the tables of experimental sections:
    1. The size of models in terms of number of parameters should be indicated in Tables 2, 4, and 5.
    2. The implementation details of DEQ-SSM NICE state — “Our DEQ-DDM NICE variant turns each of the blocks into a fully connected DEQ block of the form in equation 5 with 1000 hidden dimensions.” It is unclear what g(y) is in this case. 
    3. Please include the size of CelebA images used in Section 4.1

### Summary
Score matching methods attempt to learn probability distributions by computing a loss on the derivative of the log likelihoods, thereby circumventing the need to compute the normalising constant. Unfortunately, they are time and particularly memory intensive, on account of requiring to compute the Hessian during backpropagation. This paper uses deep equilibrium models (DEQs) to improve time and memory consumption. Experiments show that with the same computational and memory budget, DEQ models can outperform non-DEQ models.

### Strengths
This is overall a good quality paper.
- The paper cites an appropriate amount of related literature and places itself well within the literature.
- The use of phantom differentiation is nice (mentioned in section 3.4). Compute the forward iterations of the FP solver with auto-diff off, then turn it on and run K more steps. 
- Experiments are convincing and broad, and show that DEQ models consume less memory and achieve better predictive performance than some existing methods. (Contribution +)
- The paper is moistly clearly written. The illustrations are clear and informative. Tables are presented well. (However I do have questions about section 3.1, as below, hence the low "Presentation" score). (Presentation ++)
- The mathematics and formulation are mostly easy to understand, and they appear to be okay. (Soundness ++)
- This paper solves an important problem of speeding up training in score-based methods (Contribution ++)

### Weaknesses
I am willing to raise my score if the authors can respond to my queries below.

- My biggest concern is related to my first Question in the box below. Why is this method actually principled? As far as I understand, a DEQ model is used as a kind of surrogate for the true score function, and then the fixed point of this surrogate is plugged into the score function and the Fisher Divergence is minimised. Does this result in the DEQ model being somehow close to the true score function, and in particular, the fixed point of the DEQ becomes close to the fixed point of the score function? I would appreciate it if the authors could spend some more time describing the method itself (i.e., I feel section 3.1 is too short). (Presentation --)
- Proposition 2. It seems to require $K \to \infty$, however the authors state they use $K=2$. There is no quantification of the error in finite $K$ settings. Furthermore, it is not clear how error in the derivatives translates to errors in the score, or errors in the Fisher divergence. (Soundness -)

Minor:
- The first sentence in the abstract doesn't seem to make sense, however I could be wrong. Double check with someone else. I would write "Score matching methods, *which* estimate probability densities without computing the normalization constant, are particularly useful in deep learning"
- I believe there is an incorrect statement in section 3.2. "The well-posedness of the fixed-point equation 5 can be guaranteed by constraining the Frobenius norm of the weight matrix W to be less than one". This would be true if the activation were contractive (a property which is later mentioned in two sentences), however it is not necessarily true in general. One needs the weight matrix to have a norm less than 1 AND to have a contractive activation.
- I am not sure what the value is in providing Figure 2 in the main paper. First, it is entirely qualitative. Second, it is only for the newly introduced DEQ model and not for the other models. In my opinion this could be left in the appendix, with a comparison with the other methods.

### Questions
- As far as I understand, one introduces a few DEQ layers (equation 5), which compute some candidate fixed point of the score function, which is then passed to the actual score function. Is that correct? How then does the DEQ (5) become close to the true score function? Are you just relying on the Fisher divergence loss? 
- Is the following paper related at all? They compute fixed points of the score function using a DEQ, but for a rather specific model some kind of generalisation of PCA. Deep Equilibrium Models as Estimators for Continuous Latent Variables, AISTATS 2023
- It is mentioned that the Hessian is memory intensive. However, can't the HVP be computed without ever having to form the Hessian? This would then just be linear rather than quadratic in the number of parameters, without even having to approximate. I can understand time intensive, but not necessarily memory intensive. This is discussed somewhere in the third paragraph of the introduction and section 3, but could the authors please further clarify?
