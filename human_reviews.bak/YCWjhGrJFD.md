# Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 5

## Abstract
Diffusion models are a class of flexible generative models trained with an approximation to the log-likelihood objective. However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization ( DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO can adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a policy gradient algorithm to finetune text-to-image diffusion models for downstream tasks using only a reward function. Specifically, they reframe the denoising process as a multi-step MDP and introduce two variants of denosing diffusion policy optimization. In addition, they validate the proposed method on different downstream tasks, such as aesthetics and prompt-image alignment. In particular, they propose a automated VLM-based reward function for prompt-image alignment.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method is effective and validated with various experiments. Besides, this paper is simple and easy to implement. 
+ The proposed automated prompt alignment is somewhat practical and provide an alternative for prompt-image alignment.

### Weaknesses
- The contribution of the proposed method is minor, though it is effective on different downstream tasks. Compared with DPOK, the modification of policy optimization is somewhat incremental. In the related work, the authors claims that training on many prompts is one of two key advantages over DPOK. But, DPOK also can train with multiple prompts and provides quantitative results for that experiment. It is better to conduct this experiment with the same setting to support this point. Besides, the authors only show that the proposed method outperforms simple RWR methods. It is essential to compare with previous works. For example, show different methods’ ability to handle prompts involving color, composition, counting and location. 
-  As shown in Appendix B, there is a subtle bug in the implementation. This bug maybe affect the quantitative comparisons and lower the support for the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is one of my major concerns about this paper. 
- In the experiment related to aesthetic quality, the finetuned model produce images with fixed style, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6. Is it only attributed to the bug in the implementation? Based on this phenomenon, I raise a concern: does the proposed method compromise the diversity of text-to-image diffusion models?

### Questions
- In the related work, ‘Reward-Weighted Regression’ should be used before using its abbreviation (RWR). If not, it maybe a misleading phrase for the readers, especially ones without context.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method that poses the diffusion process as an MDP and applies reinforcement learning to text-to-image diffusion models. It uses different reward functions, such as image compressibility, prompt alignment and image quality. The authors formulate three different approaches to fine-tune image diffusion models, two involving multi-step reinforcement learning and one that re-weights the original inverse diffusion objective. The authors evaluate their method on relevant datasets and discuss relevant shortcomings.

### Strengths
- the paper proposes a novel work (other work mentioned in related works section is concurrent work as it will only be published at Neurips in December)
- the approach is simple yet effective
- a variety of reward functions are explored and all yield visually pleasing results

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method does not consider the problem of overoptimisation, instead the authors argue that early stopping from visual inspection is sufficient. This makes the method applicable to problems where visual inspection is possible (which is likely the case for many image tasks). However, it renders the method inapplicable to problems where the needed visual inspection is not possible. (E.g. one might not be able to apply this method to a medical imaging task where visual inspection by a human supervisor does not allow to determine when to stop the optimisation process).   
- Further, the reliance on visual inspection negatively impacts scalability of the method.  
- The evaluation is missing a simple classifier guidance baseline, where samples are generated from the diffusion model with classifier guidance according to the given reward function. (Classifier guidance is mentioned in the related work but not evaluated as a baseline)  
 - The hypothesis that cartoon-like samples are more likely after fine-tuning because no photorealistic images exist for the given prompt category could be verified by fine-tuning on categories for which photo-realistic images do exist .
- the generalization study in 6.3. is purely qualitative, a quantitative analysis would be more adequate
- similarly, overoptimization could be quantitatively analysed

### Questions
- I am wondering why the lacking quantitative experiments have not been conducted (or why they cannot be conducted)
- Similarly, I am wondering how the authors think about the early stopping mechanism

### Summary
This paper introduces Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), where they fine-tune diffusion models by reinforcement learning (RL). In specific, given the scalar reward function that takes an image and conditions (e.g., text prompts), DDPO considers the reverse generative process as Markovian Decision Process (MDP), where the reward is only given at the zeroth timestep. The authors implement DDPO via policy gradient (i.e., REINFORCE) or together with importance sampling (i.e., PPO-like approach). Through experiments they show that DDPO can be used in improving aesthetic quality, image-text alignment, and compression (or incompression) of an image, and verify its effectiveness in comparison to reward augmented fine-tuning.

### Strengths
- This paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
- The problem of solving diffusion generative processes as solving MDP is clearly stated, and the proposed method generalizes prior works (i.e., reward-weighted regression (RWR)) for the multi-step MDP case.
- The experiments clearly validate the efficiency of DDPO over prior diffusion model tuning with reward functions as well as detailed algorithmic choices are provided.

### Weaknesses
- After RL fine-tuning, the generated images seem to be saturated. For example, the fine-tuned models generate images with high aesthetic scores, but they seem to generate images with similar backgrounds of sunset. For prompt alignment experiments, the models generate cartoon-like images. 
- I think one of the main contributions of the paper is on utilizing VLMs for optimizing text-to-image diffusion models. In this context, the discussion on the choice of reward function should be discussed more in detail. For example, I think different instruction prompts for the LLaVA model would make different results, but the paper lacks details in the choice of reward function.

### Questions
- Regarding the capability of DDPO, is it possible to control the image generation to have predicted reward? For example, Classifier-Free guidance provides control over sample fidelity and diversity. It seems like DDPO improves prompt fidelity at the expense of sample diversity, so I wonder if there is a way to control the amount of reward during generation. 
- It seems like the reward function for different tasks have different ranges, and thus DDPO uses running mean and variance for normalization. I guess the difficulty of solving MDP varies across different prompts. Could the author elaborate on the optimization analysis with respect to the difficulty of prompts? 
- In implementation, the author chooses T=50 throughout experiments. What if the timesteps become smaller or larger? Definitely the denser timestep sampling would require more cost, but I believe it can reduce the variance of gradient. Could the author elaborate on this point? 
- Do the authors try different reward models for image-text alignment? How robust is DDPO algorithm with respect to different reward functions?

### Summary
This paper presents a method for fine-tuning large-scale diffusion-based text generation models using reinforcement learning. It views the reverse process of diffusion models as a reinforcement learning process with time steps T (T is the denoising steps), where the output of the diffusion model at each step serves both as an action and the observation for the next moment. The authors describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, referred to as denoising diffusion policy optimization. And the authors also employ an open-source image quality evaluator as the reward function and also devise an automated prompt-image alignment method using feedback from a vision-language model.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written, with clear logic and beautifully crafted figures, making it easy to follow the authors' line of reasoning. Additionally, the paper is well-structured, presenting an easy-to-follow approach to fine-tuning diffusion models using reinforcement learning for alignment. The narrative is straightforward, and the methods described are, in my opinion, sensible.

### Weaknesses
1) In terms of image generation quality, the paper lacks a quantitative and qualitative comparison with recent works. It fails to provide experimental support for its effectiveness. Specifically, in the absence of comparisons in image quality with all methods related to "Optimizing diffusion models using policy gradients," it is challenging to discern the improvements this paper offers over baseline approaches. This makes it difficult to evaluate the paper's contribution to the community.

2) Regarding originality and community contribution, compared to DPOK and "Optimizing ddpm sampling with shortcut fine-tuning," I did not observe significant differences between this paper and DPOK from the introduction to the Method section. The structural similarity in writing is quite evident. The most noticeable difference is the introduction of importance sampling in method 4.3. However, this alone does not sufficiently support the paper’s claims of innovation, especially without experimental evidence backing its effectiveness (if such evidence exists, please inform me during the Rebuttal phase). The second noticeable difference is the automated generation of rewards using BLIP, which is already a standard engineering practice and has been claimed by RLAIF. I do not believe the methodological contributions and community impact of this paper meet the acceptance standards of the ICLR conference.

3) The experimental evaluation criteria are unreasonable. Most pretrained reward evaluation models are not designed for robust data manifold, especially for treating it as a "fine-tuning teacher." Consequently, out-of-domain evaluation is necessarily needed. For example, the authors use Aesthetic Quality as a reward function to fine-tune the Diffusion model and employ the same Aesthetic Quality for scoring during evaluation. This approach does not allow for assessing whether an improvement in the Aesthetic Quality Score correlates with an enhancement in image generation quality. A more reasonable evaluation, as exemplified by DPOK, would involve fine-tuning with one Reward model and then evaluating it against both this model and a new, out-of-domain Reward model. DPOK's evaluating approach might provide a more substantial basis for assessment.

4) Lack of code. The lack of open-source code, compounded by the absence of comparisons with recent works, makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the approach.

### Questions
My main points have been outlined in the Strengths and Weaknesses sections. If the authors can provide satisfactory responses and additional experiments addressing these points, I would consider revising my review.
