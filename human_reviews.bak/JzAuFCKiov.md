- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire extensive world knowledge through pre-training on large corpora. However, due to exposure to low-quality data, LLMs may exhibit harmful behaviors without aligning with human values. The dominant approach for steering LLMs towards beneficial behaviors involves Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the default RL optimizer. Despite its effectiveness, PPO has limitations when optimizing rewards trained from comparison-based loss. Primarily, PPO is not invariant to equivalent reward functions containing identical preference information due to the need to calibrate the reward scale. Additionally, PPO's necessity for token-wise updates introduces complexities in both function approximation and algorithm design compared to trajectory-wise optimization. This paper proposes a new framework, reinforcement learning with relative feedback, and a novel trajectory-wise policy gradient algorithm, Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O) that operates directly on comparative rewards. We theoretically show that P3O is invariant to equivalent rewards and avoids the complexities of PPO. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that P3O outperforms PPO in the KL-Reward trade-off and can align with human preferences as well as or better than prior methods. In summary, this work introduces a simpler yet effective approach for aligning LLMs to human preferences through relative feedback.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposed a new algorithm for RLHF and tried to replace PPO. Experiments are full LM fine-tuning is conducted. 

Overall, I feel this paper studied an interesting and important problem. However, this paper is not very well-written. It is very hard to get the key contribution and understand where the benefit is coming from. The authors made a lot of comparisons: absolute feedback v.s. relative feedback; trajectory-wise v.s. token-wise; MDP v.s. CB,  but without giving a direct correlation with the proposed algorithm. 

The algorithm seems to follow the standard approach: learn a reward model first, and then optimize the reward model using some optimizations. It is unclear how significant to replace PPO by PG. In practice, the more important question is the reward model is not good enough. 

Do you still need to train a reward model first? I think it is helpful to write down the pseudo-code. If so, comparing with DPO is not fair. The main benefit of PPO is to avoid the expensive separate reward modeling + RL optimization steps.  

In DPO paper, the SFT baseline is trained on the preferred response of the preference feedback dataset. In the current work, the SFT baseline is not further trained on the preference feedback dataset. I hope the author can reproduce the result in DPO paper such that we can make sure the implementation is current.

The authors show theoretically that P3O is invariant to equivalent rewards and avoids the complexity of PPO. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that P3O outperforms PPO in the KL-Reward trade-off and can align with human preferences as well as or better than prior methods.

### Strengths
1.	The studied problem, i.e., policy optimization algorithms with human feedback, is very well-motivated and important in LLM alignment.
2.	The authors provide a rigorous theoretical guarantee on invariance for their algorithm P3O, and conduct experiments to show the good performance of algorithm P3O in the KL-reward trade-off.

### Weaknesses
1.	The authors mention that P3O enjoys the invariance property while PPO does not. Why is the invariance property important? The authors should elaborate more on how this invariance property of P3O helps improve its performance in LLM alignment.
2.	The authors should give a more detailed comparison between P3O and DPO. They both satisfy the invariance property. Why does P3O perform better in the KL-reward trade-off?
3.	Why should the KL-reward trade-off be the performance metric for LLM alignment, not the reward? Is this a standard criterion in the literature?

I will consider raising my score if my concerns are well addressed.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel policy learning method for learning from human feedback for LLM Alignment. The main idea is to derive a pairwise policy gradient method that can improve LLM alignment directly based on the comparison between rewards. The authors also compare the new proposed P3O method with previous method such as PPO and DPO, from both mathematical understanding and empirical comparison, indicating that P3O is a comparative method for LLM alignment.

### Strengths
- P3O is derived in a principled way by adding a baseline constant/function to the naive policy gradient, resulting in a pairwise policy gradient policy for LLM Alignment

- The authors discuss the connection and difference between P3O and previous methods such as PPO and DPO, which helps authors understand the underlying relationships between different alignment algorithms. 

- Empirical experiments show that the new proposed method P3O can achieve better performance on both reward and automatic evaluation scores by GP4.

### Weaknesses
- Compared with DPO, P3O still needs to learn a reward function, which increases the complexity of the overall algorithm pipeline. At the same time, I can tell from the GPT4 automatic evaluation the improvement is marginally better than DPO. 

- I feel the overall experiments are good, but at the same time, the authors might miss some baselines. For example, given the same reward function learned from the dataset, it would also be good to compare with RAFT, since it is also a very simple algorithm for policy improvement. 

- What if we apply the same clip trick for DPO? Will DPO also achieve similar performance with P3O? 

- If I understand correctly, the algorithm design is based on the assumption that we can sum over $y$: $\sum_y r(y)\pi(y)$ to obtain a constant baseline w.r.t y. But in practice, especially for the latter algorithm design, we only have one sample estimation for the summation. This could be problematic since y is a piece of sentence (tokens. or discrete variables), usually we might need large samples to obtain such an unbiased estimation, will this cause a problem for gradient estimation?

### Summary
This paper studies Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), where the default optimizer, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), is replaced by a new algorithm, Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O), that is invariant to equivalent rewards. The authors named the resulting framework 'reinforcement learning with relative feedback' and empirically show that P3O is better than existing methods.

### Strengths
**The following are the key strengths of the paper:**
1. The problem studied in the paper is interesting as making RLHF more efficient and practical has many real-world applications, especially for LLMs fine-tuning.

2. The authors show that PPO (commonly used optimizer used in RL, especially for RLHF) is not invariant to equivalent rewards and then propose a new algorithm, P3O, which overcomes this shortcoming.

### Weaknesses
**The following are the key weaknesses of the paper:**
1. Reward Equivalence: Since there are no constraints (Definition 1 should hold for all prompts, $\delta(x)$ needs to be an increasing function or constant), Definition 1 holds for each prompt. For me, saying two reward functions are equivalent implies the reward of one reward function magnifies (either positively or negatively) the reward of another function for all prompts, but Definition 1 does not guarantee it. 

2. Relative feedback: As the relative feedback is derived from the difference in rewards (as shown in Figure 1), it implies access to the rewards. First, it is not clear in which scenarios one can access the true rewards in LLMs. Second, it is unclear why not directly train the RL model using the available rewards. Methods designed for dueling bandits or RLHF are generally useful when it is hard to get the reward but easier to get pairwise preferences.

### Questions
Please address the above weaknesses.
