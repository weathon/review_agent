## Abstract
We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph neural network architecture for multi-channel time series which models observations as nodes on a dynamic graph and can thus perform data imputation by transductive node generation. Completely free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal regularity, AGG represents measurements, timestamps and metadata directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings, to then leverage attention to learn expressive relationships across the variables of interest. This way, the proposed architecture implicitly learns a causal graph representation of sensor measurements which can be conditioned on unseen timestamps and metadata to predict new measurements by an expansion of the learnt graph. The proposed AGG is compared both conceptually and empirically to previous work, and the impact of data augmentation on the performance of AGG is also briefly discussed. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series data imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet Challenge 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}.

### Summary
This paper introduces the Asynchronous Graph Generator (AGG), a new graph neural network architecture designed for multi-channel time series data. AGG represents observations as nodes within a dynamic graph, enabling it to perform data imputation through transductive node generation without relying on recurrent components or assumptions about temporal regularity. It incorporates measurements, timestamps, and metadata as learnable embeddings within the nodes and employs attention mechanisms to capture expressive relationships among these variables. AGG implicitly learns a causal graph representation of sensor measurements, which can be used to predict new measurements based on unseen timestamps and metadata. The text discusses comparisons with previous work and the positive impact of data augmentation, highlighting AGG's state-of-the-art performance in time series data imputation, classification, and prediction across benchmark datasets like Beijing Air Quality, PhysioNet Challenge 2012, and UCI localisation.

### Strengths
The paper's attempt to address the data imputation problem from the perspective of an asynchronous graph is somewhat novel.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that the proposed AGG architecture appears to be a fusion of various components, including transformers and graph encoders, but the paper lacks a detailed justification for why these specific combinations were chosen.
The experimental results presented in the paper appear to be somewhat limited and not entirely convincing. While AGG is shown to outperform existing methods in certain scenarios, a more comprehensive evaluation, including a broader range of datasets and potentially varying levels of data complexity, would bolster the paper's credibility. Additionally, insights into the computational resources required for AGG and any potential scalability challenges should be addressed. A more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains would also be valuable for readers seeking to understand the practical implications of implementing AGG in real-world applications. Overall, expanding the experimental analysis and providing a more nuanced discussion of the results would further strengthen the paper's contributions and impact.
In addition, there are opportunities to enhance the paper's presentation. For instance, there could be clearer explanations of the acquisition system's workings, the data preparation process, and the interpretation of colors (e.g., green and yellow) in Figure 2.

## Human Reviewer 2

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes an asynchronous graph generator (AGG) for data imputation, classification, and prediction that can leverage knowledge learned from the observed asynchronous time-stamped data. Specifically, AGG predicts new sensor measurements conditioned on timestamps and metadata by adding new nodes to the learned graph.

### Strengths
1. Overall, the main idea of AGG is well-delivered. The problem is well-defined, and the model architectures are clearly presented.
2. The problem that the paper aims to work on of modeling asynchronous events on graph is fascinating and important.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the problem itself is interesting, the contribution of the paper seems to be incremental. For instance, if I understand right, the model can only predict/impute measurement (i.e., $y$). However, an essential question in asynchronous event modeling is how to effectively predict the time/attribute of the next or future events. 
2. The model architecture is not novel. Most of the paper discusses embedding and attention structure, which have been well-studied in previous works. I don't think the contribution 
3. More numerical experiments should be expected to highlight the effectiveness/characteristics/benefits of the model, e.g., simulation or ablation studies. The current results seem to be a black box.

### Questions
1. Only data imputation is illustrated in Fig. 2, and based on that, it is a bit hard to imagine the situation of prediction (i.e., new nodes come after known temporal embedding). For example, if $L=4$ in Fig. 2, which batch should nodes 5 and 6 go to?
2. Is there any real example in the experiments about prediction?
3. It seems that there is no generative mechanism going on in the model? Please clarify, if possible, the meaning of "generator" in the paper.

### Summary
The authors present a graph-based approach for temporal data imputation using cross multi-head attention. The model assumes input of time-stamped observations with metadata and value of interest for imputation and prediction. Imputation requires target timestamps and metadata (in addition to the graph context of the input data including values) to predict the output value for the targets. They demonstrate superior performance when compared to baselines, particularly those based on RNNs and assuming discrete-time observations. The main advantage of their model in the demonstrated experiments seem due to the application of multi-head attention to construct a graph representation of the time series.

### Strengths
1. The authors clearly outline their modeling approach, referencing the relevant literature for embedding of temporal data, metadata, and the prediction values. The transformer encoding is intuitive and powerful, naturally inducing a continuous-time graph representation of the time series.
2. The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated methodologically in Section 4 and empirically in Section 6. The advantage of an attention-based inter-observation influence mechanism is clearly outlined as compared to RNN-type methods. The authors connect to the vision literature when investigating the data augmentation in Section 6, which is insightful.

### Weaknesses
1. As the key advantage of this work (when compared to the current baselines) is the use of attention, I think it is problematic that the authors have not compared extensively to attention-based temporal data imputation techniques. Particularly, [1] seems to be a very similar model and work, as they also evaluate on the same datasets. See their Table 1; AGG outperforms theirs in 10% and 50% missing data for PhysioNet, but they claim superior performance for 90%. The Beijing Air Quality data seem to be scaled differently, but you should also compare to their result.

In summary, a comparison should be made empirically and the differences in the methodology should be highlighted to other attention-based works for data imputation in temporal data.


2. The ability to impute continuous-time data is emphasized early in the paper, but then is not exploited in the experiments. While it is clear that this method outperforms discrete-time methods, I think a comparison to continuous-time imputation techniques would be insightful. For example, it seems GP-VAE does not use RNNs, and may also not require time discretization. You could hypothetically decode the Gaussian process to arbitrarily-time outputs, and compare more directly to your approach. Similarly, while there is not extensive literature on point process models for data imputation, they represent another class of continuous-time model which could be used to impute missing temporal data. For example, [2] introduces the PILES model for such a task. See also [3] Section 5.4.

In summary, I think an emphasis on the ability of your method to address continuous-time data imputation could address some limitations and similarities between other attention-based approaches. Additional experiments could highlight the true novelty of this approach, which I believe to be an attention-based method for **continuous-time** data imputation.


3. It seems a strong assumption that the time and (especially) metadata of unknown targets are known - can you demonstrate the ability to predict the metadata, at least? Regardless, I think it is a bit of a limitation that the timestamp of the imputed observation must be provided.


4. A minor comment: perhaps outlining the benefits/properties of each baseline would be helpful.

### Questions
As above:

1. Please comment on the difference between your approach and other attention-based approaches for temporal data imputation, and compare to these apparently strong baselines.

2. Consider continuous-time models, such as a small variation of the GP-VAE baseline and perhaps a point process type of imputation model.

3. Demonstrate that you can also predict metadata given only the timestamp of a new observation.

Small questions/comments:

4. Outline the purpose and details of the baselines.

5. Line above Eq (3) “AGG is a heterogeneous graph” but it is actually homogeneous?

6. Does the MLP hidden layer need to have $l \times d_{\rm encode}$ nodes, or is this an arbitrary choice?

7. After cross multi-head attention in Figure 3, a residual connection is shown between the output of CrossMultiHead and $h_l$. However, Eq (10) shows the residual connection between the output of CrossMultiHead and $g_0$.

8. In implementation details “the input layer of dimension 5 \times 16” where does the 5 come from in this case?

### Summary
The work proposes a graph neural network architecture for multi-channel time-series imputation, upon leveraging embeddings and attention mechanisms. The proposed method reaches satisfactory performance on various real-data examples against baselines.

### Strengths
- The proposed AGG architecture is novel and useful for the imputation, classification, and regression tasks.
- The proposed method is thoroughly explained in Section 3.

### Weaknesses
1. Literature review: Section 2 seems to ignore more recent developments on time-series imputation in the field. See a couple mentioned in this survey paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03759) and more below. In particular, the development in the field since 2022 is barely discussed.

2. Problem setup: 

- Section 3.1 introduces the problem formulation, which however is unclear to the reader. For example, is the imputation task focusing on predicting $y$? This seems to be the case as shown in Eq (12). If so, how does this differ from a standard prediction task? 
- As the authors claim "no previous GNN-based method approaches the imputation problem
from the perspective of an asynchronous graph", it is important to separate alone a section explaining the formal mathematical setup of the problem, which at least contains (1) the imputation problem (2) how this is asynchronous (3) why the problem is challenging/unique that others have not proposed ways to solve it. The current Section 3.1 is highly insufficient.

3. Experiments (existing results):
- I find it strange to say "a common AGG architecture was implemented without hyper-parameter tuning for all datasets". Does this mean your method can always work without any tuning, even for learning rate/batch size, etc.? If not, it would be important to say clearly the implication behind this.
- Related to the first point, how does your method perform under various hyper-parameters, if they are actually tuned? Would it be significantly improve over current results?
- How does your model capacity compare to those of the baselines? Your model has 378k trainable parameters. How about others? What architecture of theirs is adopted in the comparison?
- The appendix should contain a table highlighting the data specifics (e.g., number of observations, number of time-series, feature dimension, etc.), as it is hard to infer these values from looking at Appendix A.1. I would suggest the authors to list these numbers in accordance with notations in previous sections. Similar thing can be done when explaining the AGG architecture.

4. Experiments (new ones currently lacking):
- The most recent baseline is SSGAN (Miao et al., 2021). However, many works have followed theirs; a quick search reveals [1-5] for the imputation task, while I believe more are existing. I thus find it unrealistic that the SSGAN is still the "state-of-the-art" method after two years. 
- How does the method perform on other time-series datasets? The current experiments closely follow SSGAN, but it would be important to examine beyond that setting established more than 2 years ago.

## Human Reviewer 5

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studies the challenge of analyzing multi-channel time series data, particularly focusing on issues like irregular time intervals and complex spatial-temporal relationships. It proposes a novel approach with the Asynchronous Graph Generator (AGG), a graph neural network architecture that models time series observations as nodes on a dynamic graph, facilitating data imputation and prediction. AGG's unique feature is its ability to directly embed measurements, timestamps, and metadata into nodes, using attention mechanisms to discern intricate relationships among variables — which can hardly convince the reviewer — and as claimed in the paper, this method stands out from existing models by bypassing the limitations of recurrent neural networks and conventional time series models that often assume temporal regularity.

### Strengths
The reviewer can hardly say that they can understand the paper's method. But the idea that representing a multivariate time series as nodes in a graph is truly interesting. Even though the reviewer is not familiar with the baselines in this field, the experimental results seem relatively comprehensive and convincing.

### Weaknesses
The reviewer can only offer some general suggestions:

1. The reviewer believes a good research paper should be educative to general audience; they did look at Cao's work on RNN for time series imputation and find their problem set-up and  proposed approach easy to understand. Unfortunately, the current form of this paper makes it really difficult for readers without certain background knowledge to understand the setting and the contribution.

2. Given that this paper is purely empirical, the numerical experiments are the most important part to verify the performance. Table 1 may benefit from including uncertainty quantification (in the meanwhile, the reviewer acknowledges that the improvement is quite significant).

3. Terminology should be used more carefully: the term "causal" is used multiple times (and perhaps that is the reason why the reviewer gets invited to review this paper); However, it seems that "causal" merely refers to temporal order, which is "Granger causal" and means correlation from past to the future. The reviewer suggests using simple terms like temporal order directly.

4. Scaling might be one major issue when the dimension is high and the time horizon is long (since there must be a really huge graph to represent the multivariate time series).

### Questions
There are two major concerns that make the reviewer lean towards rejection of this work:

1. In Fig. 1 (c), the proposed method used future to predict past. The reviewer is fine with using the expressive power of neural networks to learn a latent causal representation, but a structure shown in Fig. 1 (c) seems to imply that the latent data generation mechanism depends on the future which is clearly wrong. Can the authors justify that?

(PS: in granger causal literature, one famous example is that "buying Christmas tree" Granger causes "Christmas". However, this example cannot justify the proposed structure since there should be a latent variable "knowing Christmas will be on 12/25" captured by the latent data generating process).

2. Another reason why the reviewer gets invited to reviewer this paper might be the use of Physionet dataset — the are a lot of lab tests in that dataset where missing values themselves mean that the clinician is not suspect of related dysfunction/disease at all. That is why there are so many missing values in that dataset —  a single patient cannot be suspected to have all diseases — and the missingness carries meaning. Can authors justify on why imputing this dataset?
