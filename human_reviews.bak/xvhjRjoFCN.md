# BiXT: Perceiving Longer Sequences With Bi-Directional Cross-Attention Transformers

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 6, 6

## Abstract
We present a novel bi-directional Transformer architecture (BiXT) for which computational cost and memory consumption scale linearly with input size, but without suffering the drop in performance or limitation to only one input modality seen with other efficient Transformer-based approaches. BiXT is inspired by the Perceiver architectures but replaces iterative attention with an efficient bi-directional cross-attention module in which input tokens and latent variables attend to each other simultaneously, leveraging a naturally emerging attention-symmetry between the two. This approach unlocks a key bottleneck experienced by Perceiver-like architectures and enables the processing and interpretation of both semantics (‘what’) and location (‘where’) to develop alongside each other over multiple layers – allowing its direct application to dense and instance-based tasks alike. By combiningefficiency with the generality and performance of a full Transformer architecture, BiXT can processes longer sequences like point clouds or images at higher feature resolutions. Our model achieves accuracies up to 82.0% for classification on ImageNet1K with tiny models and no modality-specific internal components,
and performs competitively on semantic image segmentation (ADE20K) and point cloud part segmentation (ShapeNetPart) even against modality-specific methods.

### Summary
This research paper provides an enhancement to the Perceiver architecture that employs latent queries for the distillation of input tokens. The main novelty introduced is a bidirectional cross-attention module aimed at reducing computational demands. The authors analyze an architecture that iteratively stacks query-to-token and token-to-query cross-attention modules and find symmetry between these two attention values, suggesting that these two iteratively stacked modules can be merged into one. Therefore, a new bidirectional transformer architecture that only scales linearly with the input tokens as a means of dealing with general modal input data. This replacement results in a reduction of computational cost by approximately one-third, compared to iterative stacking cross-attentions, while also achieving higher accuracies.

The improved method demonstrates an impressive 82.0% accuracy for classification tasks on ImageNet-1K using compact models. These models require only a small fraction of the FLOPS compared to the original Perceiver. The paper also provides verification tests on more generalized input modalities, reinforcing the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed enhancements to the Perceiver architecture.

### Strengths
1. The idea of introducing bidirectional attention to replace the iterative stacking cross attention is both innovative and simple. 
2. The way that the authors present their idea is also appreciated. An analog between the latent queries and "what" queries, and that between the input tokens and the "where" information, is first presented. Then, the symmetry between the "what" and "where" tokens are exemplified to suggest the improvement of the bidirectional attention. Overall, I enjoy reading this paper, and it is easy to follow.
3. The bi-directional cross-attention is effective in reducing the computational cost of the Perceiver architecture and increasing its performance. It achieves the same performance with only a fraction of FLOPS.

### Weaknesses
- Despite its effectiveness, the motivation is more from an intuitive analogy of "what" and "where" tokens than a comprehensive theoretical or experimental conclusion. Only an image classification task is presented when analyzing the symmetry between iterative cross attentions between "what" and "where" tokens. There could also exist many others scenarios, where these cross attention value may violate the symmetry property. For example, the “what” tokens would attend to the context background tokens when detecting small object in the image, whereas these attended “where” tokens would more likely to attend to other “what” tokens in the next cross attention. Therefore, it is less convincing to conclude the “symmetry” behavior of the “what” and “where” tokens from a single illustration.
    

- It is surprising and strange in Table 1(a) that the most performance gain is brought by the naive approach that sequentially stacking two cross attentions with reverse orders by exchanging the query and key positions (+ 11 acc); whereas bidirectional only brings in an additional 0.8 acc. This result seems a bit contradictory with the emphasis of the paper on the bi-directional attention. In this regard, a more important part about the reason of the largely improved performance of the sequential cross attention deserves more detailed analysis. Specifically, this phenomenon would highlight the importance of refining the image tokens instead of fixing them as in Perceiver.
    
- The FLOPSs and Params reported in Table 1(a) is confusing. The FLOPSs and Params of bi-directional cross attention are even larger than that of sequential cross attention. However,  it is described that the implementation of bidirectional cross attention saves 1/3 parameters compared to naive sequential cross attention. Results in Table 1(a) contradicts this statement.

### Summary
This paper proposes a bi-directional cross-attention Transformer (BiXT) that can process long sequences efficiently and effectively by using a small set of latent vectors to represent the ‘what’ and input tokens to represent the ‘where’ of the data. At the core of BiXT is the bi-directional cross-attention module that simultaneously refines latent vectors and input tokens. Compared to sequential cross-attention, the bi-directional cross-attention module leverages the symmetry of attention patterns between latent vectors and input tokens to reduce computational cost and memory consumption.  The authors evaluate BiXT on image classification, semantic image segmentation, and point cloud part segmentation.  They show that BiXT outperforms comparable methods in the low-FLOP regime and can easily integrate modality-specific components to improve performance further.

### Strengths
1. The proposed bi-directional cross-attention has a simple and neat design
2. Evaluations are conducted on two modalities, i.e., images and point clouds.
3. The paper is well-written, hence easy to follow

### Weaknesses
1. Despite the simple and neat design, the strength of the proposed method, bi-directional cross-attention, is unclear. Compared to using two uni-directional cross-attention modules sequentially, the system-level accuracy, FLOPs, and memory requirements are all similar (Table 1 on page 6). 

2. Insufficient comparison with some of the latest vision backbones. The methods in image classification (Table 2) and semantic segmentation (Table 3) are somewhat outdated. Many works were proposed to overcome the quadratic complexity of multi-head self-attention, such as MaxViT [1], BiFormer [2], and especially DualViT [3], which has a very similar design to BiXT. The performances of BiXT are not attractive if these approaches are included in comparison. Why are these methods not comparable with BiXT?

3. Lack of experiments with larger models. It is unclear why the comparisons are positioned in a low-FLOP regime (Table 2). BiXT seems not to be specially designed for lightweight models, and the budgets of BiXT-Ti/8 and BiXT-Ti/4 in the final section of Table 2 are sufficient to cover training larger models with more parameters. It may be better to demonstrate the effect of model scaling.

### Questions
See the weaknesses part. Overall, I appreciate the simple and neat design of the bi-directional cross-attention. Still, I would like more clarification on its strengths and the experimental settings in the rebuttal. I will raise my rating if these concerns are addressed.
