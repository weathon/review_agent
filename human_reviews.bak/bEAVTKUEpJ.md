## Abstract
Partial label learning (PLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centers on NPLL and presents a minimalistic framework called SARI that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing and standard regularization techniques. The classifier's features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. SARI combines the strengths of Average Based Strategies (in pseudo labelling) and Identification Based Strategies (in classifier training) from the literature. We perform thorough experiments on four datasets and compare SARI against nine NPLL and PLL methods from the prior art. SARI achieves state-of-the-art results in all studied settings, obtaining substantial gains in fine-grained classification and extreme noise settings.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
To deal with the problem of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), this paper proposes a framework called SARI via combining the strengths of Average Based Strategies and Identification Based Strategies. Experimental results validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1.This paper proposes an effective frameworks, which is illustrated from the experimental results.

2.The figures and tables are well presented.

3.The proposed method is easy to understand and follow.

### Weaknesses
1.My main concern is the novelty of this paper. As it claims, the novelty lies in the potential of a simpler alternatives for NPLL instead of the architecture. 

2.The simplicity of the proposed framework is partly reflected in no demand for warm-up. However, one of the key techniques is to perform pseudo-labeling via a weighted KNN algorithm, and the KNN algorithm often needs an effective feature extractor to perform well. Without the process like warm-up or pre-training, we could not obtain such an effective feature extractor.

### Questions
1.As it is mentioned above, how can the pseudo-labeling be implemented well in the proposed method with the weighted KNN? Please give more details about it.

### Summary
This manuscript considers a new setting of PLL, i.e., NPLL, and presents a minimalistic framework called SARI that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. The authors conduct some experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The manuscript is well-organized, and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
PLL itself is a noisy learning case, so it is very confusing to name Noisy PLL as a new noisy learning case. Also, it is worth thinking about whether PLL is learnable even though assuming that the ground-truth resides in the candidate label set, let alone removing the constraint as a new setting NPLL.

The simulated data in the experiments can not well reflect the real-world scenarios, thus It is meaningless to compare the results on these datasets.

BTW, I didn't see any novelty in the proposed framework. It is time to stop and think what is a meaningful research, not just pursuit for paper quantities with meaningless work.

### Questions
The techiques in the paper still combines those methods of PLL, what is your technique novelty for NPLL?

The dataset in the experiment is not reflectable on real-world scenarios, and the setting of the noise rate is too subjective. How to improve it? If no real-world data can be used for experiments, how to prove the value of NPLL setting and your proposed method without theorectical guarantee?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new framework called SARI for noisy partial label learning (NPLL) that combines the benefits of both average-based and identification-based strategies through the utilization of a weighted nearest neighbor method. The proposed framework achieves a good performance compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, occasionally delivering impressive results, especially in fine-grained classification scenarios. Ablation studies and quantitative experiments convincingly showcase the effectiveness of this approach. Overall, this work is characterized by its simplicity and reader-friendly nature, ensuring accessibility and comprehension for a wider audience.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces a new noisy partial label learning method called SARI, which performs label disambiguation by the weighted nearest neighbor method.
2. This work is straightforward and easily understandable, making it reader-friendly for potential readers.
3. Extensive experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SARI method.

### Weaknesses
The paper focus on an interesting noisy partial label learning problem and has several issues that can be improved: 

(1) The author scrutinized the deficiencies inherent in current methodologies, highlighting their complexity, warm-up requirements, and error propagation. However, it remains ambiguous how these shortcomings are tackled within the proposed method by the authors.

(2) The proposed method is easy to understand but lacks novelty. It seems no technological innovation in this approach instead of integrating the existing technologies.

(3) The proposed method appears to heavily depend on parameter selection, rendering the approach more empirical than technical.

### Questions
(1) My main concern about the paper lies in the novelty: The proposed method seems just integrates existing technologies: like small loss trick, label smoothing, mixup, and consistency regularization by using weak and strong augmentation, which leads to the novelty limited.

(2) The proposed method computes the pseudo-laebl $\hat y_i$ using weighted KNN form the entire dataset, which make the approach memory consuming and time consuming.

(3) In noisy partial label learning, the true label may not in the candidate label set. Thus, the computation of the pseudo-laebl $\hat y_i$ and class posterior probabilities $\hat q_c$ can be noisy, since the assumption proposed in the paper ‘samples in the neighbourhood have the same class label’ can hardly held.

(4) Many experimental results are missing in Table 1, Table 3, and Table 4.

(5) In ablation study, when k=25, the performance improves in $\eta=0.3$ while degrades $\eta=0.5$. However, when k=50, one degrades while the other improves. Can you explain why?

(6) Please see the weakness above.

### Summary
The author proposes a new approach in the field of weakly supervised learning in the domain of NPLL. He argues that the current methods three main challenges: 1. complexity 2. the need for warm-up 3.error propagation. In response, the author proposes the SARI model, which integrates the advantages of Average-based strategies and Identification-based strategies. Specifically, the author employs K-nearest neighbors(KNN) to obtain weighted pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. Then, a classifier is trained using these pseudo-labels, and the training process is enhanced with techniques such as smoothing and consistency regularization to improve robustness. Finally, the author updates the existing labels of the KNN with highes probability class predicted by the current model.

### Strengths
1）The author conducts an analysis of the limitations in previous methods for NPLL and identifies complexity, the need for warm-up, and error propagation as the three main challenges in this field. The author's arguments are well-founded and reasonable.

2）The structure of the paper is reading friendly and easy to understand.

3）The author's experiments are comprehensive and thorough.

### Weaknesses
1.The author only compares their method on ResNet 18. Given the fact that of several updated backbone networks has been proposed in recent years. It would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance under different backbone architectures.

2.I doubt whether the author really addresses the above three issues. The author mentions that the previous method can cause error propagation. However, KNN classifiers according to the overall features from the current encoders, and if there is too much noise features, KNN will also accumulates noise. In addition, the author mentions that the previous method has too many hyper parameters, but according to the author's proposed method, $ K, \delta, \gamma, \lambda$ and other hyper parameters are also required. Further more, according to the ablation study, Mix-up and CR significantly improves the performance. I doubt that the advantage of the author's model rooted by these existing techniques rather than new training methods, which reduces the innovation of this paper.

3.This article needs a more professional writing language.
