## Abstract
Despite their ubiquity in language generation, it remains unknown why truncation sampling heuristics like nucleus sampling are so effective. We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability. However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well. In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold. Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation strategy and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type of algorithm. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation metrics for low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text generation. Our theoretical findings and pilot experiments provide both insight into why truncation sampling works, and make progress toward more expressive sampling algorithms that better surface the generative capabilities of large language models.

### Summary
This paper aims to develop a more precise sampling strategy for language models, specifically focusing on addressing errors arising from the softmax bottleneck. The authors establish two sufficient conditions, under certain assumptions, to ensure that sampled tokens belong to the true distribution's support. The first condition (Corollary 1) leads to the threshold sampling algorithm, providing a direct explanation for its success. Assuming the loss to be cross-entropy, the second condition imposes a linear constraint that can be solved with a linear programming optimizer.Combining both conditions, the proposed basis-aware threshold (BAT) sampling outperforms its threshold-based counterparts for low-entropy open-ended text generation.

### Strengths
1. The proposed approach is innovative and theoretically-grounded. 
2. This paper brings new insights to the community. The theoretical concepts discussed in this paper are previously ignored but seems to be important.

### Weaknesses
1. Basis-aware sampling is specifically designed for models trained using cross-entropy loss. However, not all language models meet this criterion. For instance, LLMs fine-tuned with RLHF do not adhere to this condition.
2. Theorem 2 and Corollary 2 provide sufficient but unnecessary conditions for proving tokens are in the true support. Therefore, the induced sampling algorithm may also discard tokens in the support of true distribution, leading to biased sampling.
3. In Corollary 1, the statement "threshold-based truncation sampling correctly discards all tokens that are not in the support of p*" is not precise, as it may also incorrectly discard tokens that are in the support of p*. A more precise phrasing would be: "all tokens that are not in the support of p* will be discarded by threshold-based truncation sampling."
4. The relationship between the softmax bottleneck and text degeneration phenomena has not been verified. It remains unclear whether text degeneration is directly caused by the softmax bottleneck, or if increasing the dimensionality (d) beyond the vocabulary size (v) would effectively resolve the issue.

### Summary
This paper provides a theoretical analysis of why decoding from language models with truncation sampling works well and provides a new decoding strategy called BAT-sampling. The gist is that if you truncate a sufficiently large portion of the distribution, then truncation sampling will avoid any tokens which are not in the support of the true language distribution. However, this may result in throwing out tokens which *are* in the support of the distribution. The paper then proposes BAT-sampling, which is an LP-based method that can determine which tokens are and are not in the support of the true distribution, even if they are "out of order" in terms of the probability assigned (i.e., the method can determine that lower-probability tokens are in the support of the distribution even when higher probability tokens are not). The paper concludes with a set of experiments, including an impressive discussion of speedups for BAT-sampling, as well as some (very slight) improvements over existing methods in certain conditions.

### Strengths
This is a great analysis paper, providing an interesting explanation for why truncation sampling works so well in language model decoding. The paper's motivation is clear and well-written. The fact that BAT can determine that some tokens have nonzero true support, even though they are assigned less probability than others which are not in the support of the true distribution, is a surprising and compelling result. Leveraging the softmax bottleneck is a clever trick here and one that will be unexpected to most readers in NLP. 

I expected BAT to be computationally infeasible to run in practice due to its dependence on an LP-solver at each tilmestep of decoding. However, the speedups in the "Basis-aware threshold sampling in practice" (namely, using a decomposition of the softmax matrix and only relying on BAT when a token under the threshold probability is chosen) seem reasonable and compelling, and the amortized cost of 0.1s/token, while slow, is not infeasible for certain classes of applications.

The experiments, although not particularly compelling as a reason to start using BAT sampling in practice, seem reasonable and sufficiently thorough. In particular, the analysis of performance as more constraints are added back (after the SVD) is very clear. In contrast, I did not find the "BAT outperforms all other methods for GPT-2-Large" paragraph very compelling given that BAT is not the best-performing model on any other model size.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness seems to be the performance of BAT compared to other methods. Despite its theoretical justification, it does not clearly outperform other sampling approaches (Figure 5). Although there is a preference for BAT to eta-sampling shown in Figure 6 and Table 1, this preference is very slight and the comparison is only between two sampling methods. However, I do not see this weakness as a legitimate reason to reject the paper, since its main contribution seems to be analysis and theoretical understanding of existing decoding algorithms.

### Questions
1. Based on the figures (1,4), it seems like BAT is rejecting a lot of tokens corresponding to partial words. Out of curiosity: is this true, and do you have any insights into why this happens, or other qualitative insights into what tokens tend to get accepted/rejected?

### Summary
The paper proposes a theoretical understanding of truncation sampling methods. The authors proceed to devise a novel sampling strategy, building upon the approximation error incurred by the softmax output bottleneck. Essentially, the idea is to assume that a token has a non-zero probability under the true distribution, not only if it has a non-zero probability under the predicted distribution (which is a source of overestimation errors) but also if it is non-zero under all distributions that "map back" to the hidden state by taking the transpose of the output embedding matrix. Intuitively, this measures whether a token has a non-zero probability by chance, i.e. if its information can be conveyed by any combination of other tokens while mapping back to the hidden state. This is formalized in the paper by assuming that the hidden state is the minimizer of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the true distribution. This insight serves to devise a novel sampling strategy that can sample low-probability next tokens, which differs from current approaches that rely on thresholding.

### Strengths
- Nice idea and analysis
- Well written / clear
- Shines new insights on a well-studied problem and could lead to more promising sampling methods

### Weaknesses
- Results are rather weak, efficacy of the method still remains to be demonstrated (minor)
- An pseudo-code / algorithm box with the practical implementation of BA is needed in the main paper (minor)
- Unclear whether the method will help for larger models or for models where the approximation errors (under-estimation / over-estimation) are small (kinda major).

### Questions
Thank you for the efforts in writing a clear and enjoyable paper.

Main questions:
- Can you include a pseudo-code of the final BA implementation in the main paper?

- Regarding Eq. 3: what I am going to propose is a bit dirty but would it be possible at each step to minimize (W^T p - W^T \hat p)^2, wrt to p with a sparsity constraint (e.g. l1) and the range constraints, and reject all tokens for which |p| = 0? It might not derive from the theory but it might capture the overall idea? just wondering.

- Concerning the results: there isn't much of a pattern in the MAUVE results if I look at the improvements of BA across model scales. Isn't  BA expected to help more with smaller scales given that the approximation error might be bigger?

- Main problem: what happens with bigger models? given that the approximation error will be smaller, would your method still help?

Nitpicks:
- It might be clearer to re-introduce the \epsilon and \eta baselines in the experiments. I struggled a bit to remember given that they are just introduced in the background section.
- Eq. 10 in the appendix is missing a parenthesis.

I would love to give a 7, but I can't (I have to choose between 6 and 8 now). I will give a 6 for now, and wait for authors responses with the will to increase my scores if more details / addition to the papers are given :-)

### Summary
This paper aims to give a formal justification for why truncation based sampling approaches work well in language generation. They link this phenomenon to the softmax bottleneck—the problem that the final linear layer in a neural network often bottlenecks the expressivity of the model. Explicitly, given the difference between the hidden (embedding) dimension and the vocabulary size, the final linear transformation before the softmax projection can only perform a low-rank projection. The authors claim that the resulting approximation to the target distribution is likely the source of model errors that leads to the “unreliable tail” probabilities observed by prior work. The authors develop an algorithm for uncovering which tokens are necessarily in the support of the target distribution, and propose to use this algorithm as the basis for a truncation sampling method. They provide empirical results (including human evaluations) when using this method.

### Strengths
* The work offers a theoretical explanation for why certain ad-hoc methods used during language generator decoding work well. This is a valuable insight to the NLG community
* The work then develops a sampling algorithm based on this theoretical explanation

### Weaknesses
* The theoretical portion of the paper is at times difficult to understand due to notational choices and lack of specificity (for example, switching between individual token probabilities ). This is particularly important since the theoretical portion is the main contribution of the work 
* The method does not appear to have empirical performance benefits and is computationally expensive, making it impractical
* There lacks robust empirical justification of the hypothesis. Figure 7, which is intended to show that including more of the original optimization problem constraints lead to better results, only consists of 3 points, which hardly feels like enough evidence to claim a “trend”.
* The terminology of the “true” distribution is perhaps misleading. I personally think that something like the “aggregate” distribution or the “data-generating” distribution would be more accurate
* A small point: the intro of section 4 has some grammatical errors

### Questions
* Since the matrix W is static, can (3) not be solved for all elements of the vocabulary that meet the desired constraint ahead of time?
* Why is typical sampling omitted from the discussion of truncation-based sampling methods? It is arguably the most similar to the proposed method since it likewise “is able to discard higher-probability tokens while keeping… lower-probability tokens.” On a similar note, I don’t understand footnote 3; I don’t think it actually describes what is done by locally typical sampling
* The phrasing of footnote 1 is strange. Specifically, the statement “setting p∗ to be the 1-hot vector indicating the gold token” is underspecified. I imagine that this is referring to the conditional distribution for a particular prefix
* In theorem 1, these factors are the collective probability over/underestimation across all tokens, right? This then implies that no individual token probability can exceed these bounds. This logic should be made more explicit (the current notation is vague) 
* I don’t think that the softmax function satisfies the additivity property required of a “linear map.” Could you please elaborate on this claim at the top of page 6?
* On page 5, what is the concrete distinction between low vs. high quality tokens? Is this another way of saying in vs. out of the true distribution? It would be helpful to change the language here to align with the other terminology used by the paper
* The informal description about the practical implementation of basis-aware sampling is confusing. For example, what does “discarding the majority of the constraints” refer to?
* Given the observation that BAT sampling performs more strongly in lower entropy settings, a logical next step would be to see how it performs in translation or summarization, where historically, sampling has not led to the best results.
* It is perhaps more accurate to call the projection by W a linear layer instead of softmax layer, since the low-rank approximation is tied to this linear transformation, not the use of the softmax as a projection function. Further, are there insights into how the nature of these results will change with alternative projection functions, like the sparsemax?
* Can these principles be used to explain the degeneracy that happens when selecting high probability tokens, i.e., during greedy decoding?
* How do these results align with other work that has tried to explain why truncation methods work well in practice, such as [1]?
