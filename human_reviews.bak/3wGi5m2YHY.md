# FlowHash: Accelerating Audio Search with Balanced Hashing via Normalizing Flow

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
Nearest neighbor search on context representation vectors is a formidable task due to challenges posed by high dimensionality, scalability issues, and potential noise within query vectors. Our novel approach leverages normalizing flow within a self-supervised learning framework to effectively tackle these challenges, specifically in the context of audio fingerprinting tasks. Audio fingerprinting systems incorporate two key components: audio encoding and indexing. The existing systems consider these components independently, resulting in suboptimal performance. Our approach optimizes the interplay between these components, facilitating the adaptation of vectors to the indexing structure. Additionally, we distribute vectors in the latent $\mathbb{R}^K$ space using normalizing flow, resulting in balanced $K$-bit hash codes. This allows indexing vectors using a balanced hash table, where vectors are uniformly distributed across all possible $2^K$ hash buckets. This significantly accelerates retrieval, achieving speedups of up to 3$\times$ compared to the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). We empirically demonstrate that our system is scalable, highly effective, and efficient in identifying short audio queries ($\leq$2s), particularly at high noise and reverberation levels.

### Summary
This paper proposes FlowHash, a framework for learning locality sensitive hashing codes for audio retrieval. It uses contrastive learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar item pairs and adopts normalizing flow to learn balanced binary codes for the items.

### Strengths
1.	The ideas are presented clearly.
2.	The limitations are discussed.

### Weaknesses
1.	The methodology is outdated. In the field of vector search, the performance of LSH has been overwhelmed by vector quantization [1] and proximity graph [2] techniques by orders of magnitude in recent years. Pls check the two seed papers and the numerous papers that cite them. Although this fact may not be well known in the field of audio retrieval, I wonder a whether a simple adaption of proximity graph outperforms SOTA LSH methods for audio retrieval. The authors may consider switch to the latest techniques to vector search. Note that, vector quantization also has variants that use end-to-end training similar to this paper.

2.	Novelty is unclear. Section 3.1 uses contrastive learning to enlarge the distance gap between similar and dissimilar item pairs. This methodology is widely used in machine learning, and the authors should clarify the unique designs for audio retrieval. The core contribution seems to be using normalizing flow to ensure that the items are evenly distributed among the hash buckets. Again, the bucket balance constraint is widely recognized to be important and considered by many related works. Pls refer to the references in [1]. The authors should clarify the differences and advantages of normalizing flow over alternative bucket balance techniques.

3.	Experiments need to be improved. (1) Pls report the dataset statistics in a table, e.g., the number of items and the dimension. (2) When evaluating efficiency, pls use the query processing time. Currently, using the number of searched items cannot consider the costs of the encoding and hashing operations; plus that query processing time affects user experience more directly. (3) Pls use the time-recall curve to compare different methods, and an example can be found in the HNSW paper. Currently, Tabe 1 aligns neither the query time nor the recall of the methods, which makes it different to compare different methods. (4) Include the model training time of the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper proposes a normalized flow-based hashing technique, which aims at providing uniformly distributed hash codes for a more efficient retrieval performance. Compared to an unstructured (unsupervised) hashing approach, their approach appears to be more beneficial as the search process is more streamlined. For the audio retrieval application, they proposed a three-step hashing process, where the first two are dedicated to learning representations from the sequence and then reduce to the dimensionality, while the third flow model makes sure that the final hash codes follow the organized bimodal distribution, thus making quantization easy. The experimental results show improvement although they are not significant.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The sections are clearly defined, and the math notations are clear, too. 

- The proposed model consists of three different modules. It's clear that each of these modules has its own purpose. The combination makes sense, too. 

- The employment of the normalization flow, which is the main contribution of this work, is a convincing choice and reasonable.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method has other potential relevance to the hashing literature, which the paper doesn't discuss. For example, semantic hashing and LSH have this property that similar examples (either perceptually or from the application's perspective) tend to collide more often. In some audio retrieval tasks, this property might not be necessary, but it must be nice if the paper discusses this aspect, as to whether the proposed model results in these semantically relevant codes.

- The main weakness of the experimental results is, actually, the misrepresentation of the bold numbers in Table 1. It seems that the authors use bold characters to represent the best-performing model for each configuration, and the proposed model was chosen oftentimes, misleading the readers. However, with a careful examination, I was able to see that TE+LSH is the winner many times. It seems that TE+NF still slightly outperforms other methods in the noise-only case, but in other noise+reverb or reverb-only cases, TE+LSH is the clear winner. I believe that this is a critical mistake and the discussions and conclusion should be fixed accordingly.

### Questions
- In audio retrieval, for example, there can be semantically relevant examples (e.g., cover songs), that could share similar hash codes for a different applicational advantage. It appears that the proposed method relies heavily on the "exact match" scenario, which is also a legitimate application. Any additional explanation on this issue? This is also relevant to my other point about semantic hashing. 

- The NF results are regularized to be a bimodal normal distribution. During training, these distributions are fixed with pre-defined mean and variances. Any chance this rigid definition could harm the hashing performance?

### Summary
This paper introduces FlowHash, a novel hashing scheme for solving the audio fingerprinting task.
They utilize the normalizing flows within the pre-trained Transformer-based encoder to obtain balanced K-bit hash codes, allowing efficient retrieval of the audio content. 
Moreover, they incorporate a cross-entropy-based regularization term to achieve robust hash codes.
FlowHash proves to be an effective technique for reducing retrieval time and enhancing robustness against certain levels of noise and reverberation.

### Strengths
S1. **Novel Application of Normalizing Flows:**
It is interesting to leverage normalizing flows to achieve balanced hash codes. 

S2. **Robust Hash Codes**:
They utilize the BCE loss as a regularization term to enhance the robustness of hash codes and perform experiments to validate this claim.

S3. **Comprehensive Experiments:**
They conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method across various benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
W1. **Limited Novelty:**
The architecture and approach presented in this work bear strong resemblances to the methods proposed by Singh et al. (2023). Specifically, both papers leverage a Transformer-based encoder, which has already been extensively explored in the context of the prior work. The main extensions in this work over Singh et al. (2023) are the use of normalizing flows and the incorporation of the BCE loss. While these are indeed differences, since they are commonly used in other areas such as CV and NLP, their introduction might not be substantial enough to be considered groundbreaking.

W2. **Marginal Improvement over Accuracy:**
The paper highlights the capabilities of FlowHash in reducing retrieval candidates and enhancing robustness. These are undoubtedly important aspects in many practical applications. However, a critical metric for many machine learning tasks, particularly in the retrieval task, is accuracy. Based on the presented experimental results, it appears that the accuracy gains from using FlowHash are marginal. In some cases, e.g., from Tables 1 and 2, there might even be a trade-off where accuracy is sacrificed.

W3. **Extended Experiments:**
It might contain bias and becomes less convincing to conduct the experiments through a single dataset. 
Moreover, while the paper emphasizes reduced memory overhead, it doesn't delve deep into the space overhead introduced by the hashing mechanism.

W4: **Incorrect Highlighted Results:**
In Tables 1 and 2, the authors have used bold fonts to signify the best results across different query lengths and varying levels of Noise and Reverberation. However, upon close inspection, there appear to be inconsistencies in the highlighted results, with several best values not being bolded correctly. Such incorrectly highlighted results can lead readers to draw wrong conclusions about the performance of the proposed method or its competitors.

### Questions
Regarding W3:

Q1: Can the authors include more real-world datasets for performance evaluation? It will be more convincing to justify the claims of robust and balanced hash codes with more datasets. 
 
Q2: Can they report the memory overhead of different methods with the same recall rates? It will be beneficial to showcase the claim of memory reduction.

Regarding W4:

Q3: The authors should meticulously review Tables 1 and 2 to ensure that the best results are correctly highlighted. This might require re-checking the raw results to confirm the top performers.
