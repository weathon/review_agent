# Conformal Inductive Graph Neural Networks

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Conformal prediction (CP) transforms any model's output into prediction sets guaranteed to include (cover) the true label. CP requires exchangeability, a relaxation of the i.i.d. assumption, to obtain a valid distribution-free coverage guarantee. This makes it directly applicable to transductive node-classification. However, conventional CP cannot be applied in inductive settings due to the implicit shift in the (calibration) scores caused by message passing with the new nodes. We fix this issue for both cases of node and edge-exchangeable graphs,  recovering the standard coverage guarantee without sacrificing statistical efficiency. We further prove that the guarantee holds independently of the prediction time, e.g. upon arrival of a new node/edge or at any subsequent moment.

### Summary
The work develops conformal prediction for graph neural networks in the inductive setting (i.e., new nodes and edges are added in test time). Specifically, the authors address the implicit shift in calibration scores by recompute the calibration scores with respect to the new graph to restore coverage guarantees. Empirical comparisons against the standard CP (std. CP) on different GNNs and graph datasets are considered.

### Strengths
* Address the limitations of existing methods for inductive node-classification by recognizing that calibration and evaluation scores computed conditional to a specific subgraph are still exchangeable.
* Adapt the non-exchangeable CP method in the edge-exchangeable case, with weights inverse proportional to nodal degrees.
* Show promising results on different datasets and GNN models.

### Weaknesses
* Missing literature review: The work does not have a standalone literature review section. 

* Writing: 
   * Organization: the lengths between sections 4 and 5 are imbalanced. Specifically, section 4 contains the "method", theoretical analyses, and examples, where section 5 made reference to section 4 but the algorithm is delayed until the appendix. I think it makes more sense to first introduce the method, provide intuitions of why it works, and then give the theoretical analyses with additional remarks.
   * The Algorithm in Appendix A is not well-written. For example, it is unclear how $\boldsymbol{S}_t$ in line 5 is used later. The $\tau^t$ in line 11 is also different from that in lines 7 and 9. Furthermore, it is unclear where the algorithm starts because the line numbers for inputs are intertwined with those for algorithmic steps.

* Experiments:
    * As explained in the paper, it is expected that standard CP does not work (e.g., in terms of reaching the coverage guarantees). I expect to see additional baselines for this setting that can be compared.
    * Missing examples on larger graphs. For example, the Flickr and Reddit2 datasets in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14555.pdf. These examples have considerably more nodes than the current settings.
    * Missing standard deviation of results. From Figure 3 and 4, it seems the standard deviations can be high (I assume each line with light color indicates results from a specific run).
    * Presentation needs to be improved. For example, the left column of Figure 3 and the Figure 4 have too many lines that affects readability. It is best to just show the average values with error bars. In addition, the authors considered 4 GNN models, but results for some more recent ones are only in the appendix. 
    * Misleading Table 1: it says "average deviation from guarantee", but it does not mean a higher deviation necessarily means worse performance. This is because if deviation is positive, this indicates over-coverage, which is still acceptable (one just needs to lower the significance level). In fact, this seems to be the case from looking at Figure 3.

### Questions
* Method: 
   * What is the complexity of the method with respect to graph size, number of samples, number of classes, etc. Specifically, if the graph $\mathcal{G}_t$ is large with complicated definition of score $s$, I expect line 5 of Algorithm 1 to create some computational burden in real-time use.
   * How does the method work if two or more nodes/edges are added at each time step?
* Experiments:
   * What exactly is the "standard CP" in the inductive context and how is it actually implemented? The idea of standard CP is mentioned in section 2, but that section is for general CP and transductive GNNs. I think the details should be discussed in the appendix with a reference in the main text, unless the baseline is taken directly from existing methods. Also, I think the abbreviation "std. CP" reads too much like standard deviation of CP, so I suggest changing the name.
   * Does the method always work well on any GNN models being considered? It is helpful and important to discuss the generality and/or limitation of the method for different GNN baselines
   * From looking at Figure 3 and 4, it seems standard CP coverages gradually increases as timestep increases. This leads to larger set sizes (as expected). Why is this the case? I think for a meaningful comparison, the empirical coverage should be set the same and then we can compare average set size.

### Summary
This paper studies conformal prediction (CP) on graph data with graph neural networks in node-exchangeable and edge-exchangeable settings. The author(s) describe how certain exchangeability structure for nodes still persist in these settings, and how conformal prediction techniques can be adapted based on these observations. In particular, the proposed CP methods are valid conditional on subgraphs and when stopping at non-adversarial times, especially in cases when standard CP fails to provide the desired coverage. The methods and theory are clearly supported by empirical experiments. 

Overall, I think this paper provides interesting discussion, which both extends the current understanding of CP on graph-structure data and forms a solid foundation for future efforts in this direction. Though the methods only adapt existing ones, the discussion on exchangeability structure is important. The presentation is overall clear, but potential improvements in mathematical rigor and presentation clarity would further strengthen this paper.

### Strengths
1. Significance of contribution.

Conformal prediction on graph data has just recently become a popular topic. This topic is important for deploying GNNs in critical domains. While existing discussion mainly focuses on transductive setting, or only provides approximate and not-actionable guarantees for other settings, this paper stands out by providing solid theory, method, and experiments on node-exchangeable and edge-exchangeable settings. By thoroughly exploring the exchangeability structure in these settings, existing CP methods can be applied to solve seemingly challenging problems in this field. Thus, I think this paper makes a significant contribution to this topic, and will inspire future research efforts of the community.

2. Originality. 

The idea of this paper is original and provides novel insights. 

3. Quality. 

This is a thorough paper with solid theory, fruitful discussion, and concrete experiments. 

4. Clarity. 

The presentation is moderately clear. The positive points include (1) informative comparison to the literature, (2) useful remarks from place to place, and (3) succinct and clear statements of problem settings. I will mention points for improvement in the weakness part.

### Weaknesses
My complaints are not detrimental to this paper. I'm happy with the main ideas of this paper, so they are just comments that should be addressed to make the paper stronger. 

Conformal prediction relies crucially rigorous mathematical statements about how data is generated / how test data appears in the set, how score functions are defined, how the score is trained and applied. These are all important factors for the validity of CP. While I believe the technical discussion in this paper is correct, sometimes I have to further check the statements in my own mind as some crucial mathematical terminologies are missing. A few possible points that deserve clarification include (1) formal definition of node and edge exchangeability, (2) clearly state the conditions on the score function and how the model is trained, (3) formal definition and examples of the "evaluation mask", etc. Please see my questions part. I'd be happy to increase my score if these points can be addressed.

### Questions
1. Mathematical definition of node exchangeability and edge exchangeability.

I suggest adding a formal definition for node and edge exchangeability, just to avoid any confusion. It will also be beneficial to mention some important implications of such exchangeability, e.g., at each time $t$, the existing nodes are exchangeable, so on and so forth. 

2. Rigorous terminology in explaining Proposition 1.

Currently the explanation via $Z=AXW$ after Proposition 1 can be improved by using rigorous terminologies. For instance, in "For the guarantee to be valid the first two blocks of the result must be row-exchangeable.", it is unclear what "the first two blocks of the result" is, which is harmful for understanding. Also, related to question 1, "For Mat(1) row-exchangeability already holds from Theorem 2" can be further clarified by pointing out that nodes in cal and eval are exchangeable due to node exchangeability. I suggest the authors revise this part to improve clarity. 

3. How is the evaluation set $\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ decided? 

I am a bit confused how one decides the evaluation set at each time. Is there a pre-defined rule, for instance, do we evaluate all newly arrived nodes immediately at each time $t$, or do we pre-fix the set of indices that will be evaluated at each time $t$? I was asking because if $\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ is data-dependent, it may need more efforts in justifying the approach/theory. 

4. Definition of $Cov(\mathbb{I}_T)$.

This is an important quantity in the theorem, and it shall be formally defined. 

5. Requirement on score function in Prop 1 and Theorem 3. 

It seems to me that under node exchangeability, one still has exchangeability between calibration and evaluation nodes. However, it is now crucial how the score function $s$ is trained. At least it should be permutation invariant to these nodes? But nothing is mentioned there. I suggest revising this proposition (and its proof, which is a bit handwavy). Similarly for Theorem 3. 

6. Is there a technical result for the validity of weighted CP in edge-exchangeable setting? 

The discussion for edge exchangeability (the end of Section 4) is interesting, but incomplete as there is no formal theorem on the validity of weighted CP. I would suggest adding a formal theorem, with clear description on how the edge appears (e.g., it is more clear to state that edges are uniformly sampled from a candidate edge set). 


-------
small typos & wording questions:
1. Section 4, line 3: "callibration node" should be "calibration node"

2. Lemma 1, "defined on a subsets of $\mathcal{X}$"

3. I don't really understand the sentence "Specifically we can not use the prediction sets of a particular node multiple times to compare and pick a specific one (see § D.4 for a discussion)." in the second paragraph of Section 5.

### Summary
While for transductive node-classification, we are given a fixed graph, in the inductive scenario the graph is changing. This leads to a shift in the scores and the standard conformal prediction methods do no longer apply.  This paper therefore proposes a method for calculating conformal prediction sets within the framework of inductive graph classification. The authors demonstrate coverage guarantees and provide extensive empirical experiments to show that their method is effective.

### Strengths
This is an interesting conformal prediction problem.

The paper seems solid with a large amount of experiments.

The code of experiments is available in the supplementary material.

### Weaknesses
1\ I found the paper difficult to follow. For instance, the setting of transductive node-classification of Section 2.1 or the inductive one of Section 3 are not properly defined. Another example is Fig.1 which is, in my opinion, not very clear and not explained properly. The definition of a graph is never given etc. Globally, the paper lacks explanation.

2\ There is a misuse of several words/expressions to discuss known concepts, which ultimately confuses the paper. What is the added value of a phrase such as "calibration budget" to mean that we only use the first N nodes or "no longer congruent with test scores" to mean that it is no longer exchangeable?

3\ The paper never indicates when scores should be assumed to be continuous in theoretical results. For instance, in all the remarks below Theorem 1, we need this assumption.

4\ There is no "limitation" in the conclusion.

Minor:

typos "callibration", "hyper-geomteric"

### Questions
Is it possible to "boost" any given non-conformity score with graphical information as in "Uncertainty Quantification over Graph with Conformalized Graph Neural Networks"?

Can you give the mathematical definition of "node-exchangeability" and "edge-exchangeability"?

What are the main limitations of the method?

Can you explain Fig1 and Fig9 in more detail?

### Summary
This paper explores the application of conformal prediction to graph neural networks, particularly addressing the challenge of inductive settings where the entire graph is not visible. In such scenarios, classic conformal prediction cannot be directly applied due to the loss of exchangeability when new nodes are introduced, which shifts the distribution of calibration scores.

### Strengths
The key insight of this paper is to demonstrate that the impact of new data points on the calibration and evaluation sets is symmetric, ensuring that the shift embedding still maintains its guarantee, conditional to the graph at a specific time step.

### Weaknesses
(1) Notations:
The presentation of this paper leaves room for improvement, as some notations are either omitted or unclear, making it misleading for readers. For instance, in Equation (3), the graph is not explicitly noted, and on page 5, in the linear message passing example, the meanings of A, X, and W are not immediately clear. Although these aspects become clearer upon reading the entire paper, the initial lack of clarity can impede readers from following the logic in their first encounter.

(2) Baselines:
In the experimental section, the paper exclusively utilizes standard CP as the baseline. While the authors explain the rationale for not including NAPS as a baseline, it would be beneficial to at least include NAPS results or another inductive-case baseline in the experimental evaluation for a more comprehensive assessment.

(3) Efficiency:
For CP methods, it's essential to consider both validity and efficiency. While the experimental results focus on "coverage," which assesses validity, it's equally crucial to assess efficiency. A predictive set that is overly large may not be practically useful. Therefore, it is recommended to include at least one experiment that demonstrates the efficiency of the subgraph CP method.

 Taking into account the feedback from other reviewers and the author's response, I have decided to raise my score.
