- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Momentum is a widely adopted and crucial modification to gradient descent when training modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we target on the regularization effect of momentum-based methods in regression settings and analyze a popular proxy model, diagonal linear networks, to precisely characterize the implicit bias of  heavy-ball (HB) and Nesterov's method of accelerated gradients (NAG). We show that, HB and NAG exhibit different implicit bias compared to GD for diagonal linear networks, which is different from the one for  classic linear regression problem where momentum-based methods share the same implicit bias with GD. Specifically, the role of momentum in the implicit bias of GD is twofold. On one hand, HB and NAG induce extra initialization mitigation effects similar to SGD that are beneficial for generalization of sparse regression. On the other hand, besides the initialization of parameters, the implicit regularization effects of HB and NAG also depend on the initialization of gradients explicitly, which may not be benign for generalization. As a consequence, whether HB and NAG have better generalization properties than GD jointly depends on the aforementioned twofold effects determined by various parameters such as learning rate, momentum factor, data matrix, and integral of gradients. Particularly, the difference between the implicit bias of GD and that of HB and NAG disappears for small learning rate. Our findings highlight the potential beneficial role of momentum and can help understand its advantages in practice from the perspective of generalization.

### Summary
The work explores the role of momentum gradient descent (HB and NAG) in the implicit bias for diagonal linear networks. The authors borrow the $O(\eta)$-close continuous flow approximation for momentum from Kovachki and Stuart and use it to derive the continuous flow for the diaognal linear network. Then they conclude that the modified hyperbolic entropy potentital they find with solving this second order differential equation has a smaller initialization scale. This initialization becomes more small as the accumulation of norm of gradients increase and as the momentum parameter ($\mu$) increase. A standard technique to analyze the implicit bias in such simple networks is the scale of initialization (smaller the richer) which controls the transition from rich to kernel regime (Woodsworth et al). Several works show that SGD and finite step-size also decrease this scale of initialization. And in this paper, the authors try to make an incremental contribution to show that momentum also does the same.

### Strengths
The paper is easy to read and follow.

### Weaknesses
The paper has serious novelty issues and technical issues. The authors seem to be not aware of the paper [1] which already analyzed the implicit regularization for momentum in deep learning models. In my opinion, the theorem from the paper can be extended to diagonal networks with calcualtions (with almost the same conclusion as theirs). Additionaly the consideration of continuous time approximation for HB and NAG has some technical concerns which I will discuss. 

**1) Major novelty issues**

In page-3, the authors claim "Compared to previous works, we develop the continuous time approximations of HB and NAG
for deep learning models, **which is still missing in current literature**, and we focus on the implicit
bias of HB and NAG rather than GD". This statement is False and the paper [1] already analyzed the implicit regularization of momentum through continuous (and modified)  time approximations of HB and NAG for deep learning models. It's unfortunate that the authors were not aware of the work. They [1] do it in a more general setting (not restricted to diagonal networks). This general setting can be also extened to diagonal linear networks with the conclusion unchanged. 

**2) A simple extension to the results of [1] may lead to the same conlcusion as this paper**

Consider the theorem 4.1 in [1] which proposes an  $O(\eta^2)$ continuous approximation (as opposed to a weaker O(\eta) approximation in this paper ) to the discrete H.B updates. In this case, the implicit regularization is of the form of the norm of the gradients $\frac{(1+\mu)\eta}{4(1-\mu)^3}|| L(w)||^2$, which promotes flatter sub-trajectories than gradient descent modified flow (which is only $\frac{\eta}{4}|| L(w)||^2$ ). For diagonal linear networks, this regularizer can be explicitly calcualted to be $|| \hat{X}^T r(t) \circ w(t)||^2$ where $w=[u,v]$ according to . I am directly borrowing equation-15 from page-20 in Woodsworth et al, which I feel the authors would be familair with. Now this regularization term  $|| \hat{X}^T r(t) \circ w(t)||^2$ may lead to a form of weighted weight-decay on the factors and it is well known that weight decay on the factors u and v promote sparseness (or minimizes the l1 norm of reconstruction of $\beta$). And this regularization increases with momentum and vanishes for very small step-size (these two are the two main conclusions from this paper). In simpler words, **sparser solutions correspond to the flatter solutions for the diagonal linear networks (see Section 5.2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07011.pdf) and [1] already showed that momentum drives trajectories to flatter minimas and this effect vanishes with learning rate tending to 0**. 

**3) Major technical concern**

The authors claim "Proposition 1 is an application of Theorem 3 of Kovachki & Stuart (2021) and we present an
alternative proof in Appendix B" where **infact they use exactly Theorem-4 (without any modfiication)**  from Kovachki & Stuart (2021) . Additionally while stating such approximating continuous flows it is very important to mention how much it deviates from the true discrete trajectory (which the original theorem mentions). In this case, the deviation of the approximating continuous flow and the discrete trajectory is order $O(\eta)$ [Theorem 4 in Kovachki & Stuart (2021)]. The problem arises because the authors **do not find the implicit bias of HB and NAG but instead for an approximate continuos version which is $O(\eta)$**. This is problematic because mostly in the paper authors refer to this as "implicit bias of HB and NAG" but it is not. Note that for large time T, this two trajectories deviate as the hidden coefficeint for the $O(\eta)$ is exponential on time. Two questions and discussion can form from this:

*A) Existing works on diagonal linear networks already use continuous version of GD, so why not momentum?*

This is because, the existing works are explicitly for gradient flow and not on gradient descent. The analysis for gradient descent varies largely from those of gradient flow. So, in this current work the implicit bias found is for an $O(\eta)$-approximate continuous version of HB or NAG (and not for HB or NAG)

*B) Why not use an $O(\eta^2)$ continuous approximation for HB?*

If the authors consider the $O(\eta)$-continuous flow as a good approximation for HB,NAG (which it is not), then Theorem-7 in Kovachki and Stuart is more suitable candidate for analysis of HB and NAG. This is because this modified flow is  $O(\eta^2)$ to the trajectory of HB and NAG whereas the continous flow considered is only $O(\eta)$ close. The analysis would also be easier due to the use of first order ODE instead of second order ODE. See point 2 above for details on this. 

**4) Observations from section 3.3 is already done in [1]**

The implicit bias for learning rate tending to 0 will lead to similar regurlaizations as GF and this approximate momentum flow is already made in [1] with theorems and experiments. 

**5) Missing insights in terms of convergence and saddle to saddle jump issue**

 Momentum is well know to accelerate convergence (the re-sclaed gradient demonstrates that obviously), however the authors claim that momentum will have an effect of smaller effective initializationl. In the class of problems considering incremental learning (diagonal linear networks and matrix sensing), it is well known about the tension between saddle escape time and generalization, smaller initialziation improves generalziation but leads to larger saddle escape time. Does the effective smaller intiialization also increase the saddle escape time ? This is contradictory to the assumption that momentum has faster convergence. The current analysis did not provide any insight.

### Questions
Although there are novelty concerns, I would still like to hear from the authors about the response to the following points

1) Justification for the use of the approximate continuous flow. And why not use a more approximate flow. 
2) Is there any viable way the contributions of this work differ from [1]?

### Summary
In this manuscript, the authors rigorously examine the implicit biases introduced by momentum-based optimization techniques, specifically focusing on the Heavy-Ball (HB) method and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) scheme, within the context of diagonal linear networks. The paper establishes a dual role for momentum: Firstly, it reveals that both HB and NAG contribute to mitigating the effects of initialization, thereby implicitly steering the linear predictor toward a solution more akin to sparse ($L^1$) regression. Secondly, it uncovers that the implicit bias introduced by momentum is dependent on the gradient initialization, a factor that may not necessarily improve generalization. The claims are verified through numerical experiments.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and well organized.
2. The paper distinguishes itself by shifting the focus from the extensively studied implicit biases of Gradient Flow (GF) and Gradient Descent (GD) to the role of momentum in neural architectures—a novel and impactful contribution to the literature.
3. Although the explicit characterization of momentum's implicit bias, as articulated in Theorem 1, is intricate—entailing a time integral with undetermined dynamics on $\theta(t)$—its mitigating impact on initialization is nonetheless discernible, given that the integral consistently assumes positive values.
4. The empirical experiments effectively corroborate the theoretical findings.

### Weaknesses
1. One potential shortcoming lies in the architectural constraints of the study.  Would it be difficult to generalize the results to multilayer networks that are not diagonal?
2. The paper leaves room for clarification regarding the equivalency of Equation (6) to a "standard" diagonal linear network. Although a footnote references Woodworth et al. (2020), it is beneficial to include this in the paper for completeness.

### Summary
This paper extends the analysis of (Woodworth et al., 2020) for the implicit bias over the diagonal linear network from GD to GD with momentum (HB and NAG). Specifically, this paper considers a continuous-time approximation of HB and NAG, and shows that the limiting iteration solves a similar but different minimization problem compared to GD. The authors further analyze the problem and show that  HB and NAG ensures better generalization ability under certain conditions. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the comparison between HB, NAG, and GD, and the effect of hyperparameter for implicit bias.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and well-organized

2. The theoretical results are novel and solid.

### Weaknesses
1. **Related works**: There are missing related works. Specifically, this paper claims several times "All these implicit bias works do not consider momentum". However, to my knowledge, there are several existing works studying the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers, including (Gunasekar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2022; Jelassi et al., 2022). I strongly suggest the authors discuss the correlation and difference between this paper and the mentioned existing works.

2. **Difference between GD and HB/NAG**: The difference of implicit bias between GD and HB/NAG is still not clear to me. For example, if the $\theta^TR$ term is discarded, isn't the implicit bias of HB/NAG always achieved by GD with a  smaller initialization scale? If that is true, I think it is not proper to say HB/NAG has a better implicit bias than GD, since it seems GD contains as same (if not richer) range of implicit bias as HB/NAG .

3. In the sentence under the second formula in page 7, if letting $\mu=0$, $R$ will equal to $R^{GF}$, which further equals to $0$, right? But I failed to show $R=0$ when $\mu=0$? 

4.  About for Figure 1, why GD is better when $||\xi||_1$ is large? Does this contradict the theory?

### Summary
The paper studies the implicit regularization effect of the momentum methods through their continuous-time approximations in the case of diagonal networks. The paper discusses the role of initialization and the gradient of the loss at initialization on the recovered implicit bias. The theory is supported by experiments.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a well-motivated problem. Given the widespread use of momentum in training deep networks, gaining insights into its implicit regularization and convergence, even for simple non-convex models, is essential.

### Weaknesses
I believe that Theorem 1 is incorrect or at least it is incorrectly stated. 

The paper studies momentum ODE but the problem is in the analysis, i.e., proof of Proposition 3 and Theorem 1, the $\eta^2$ terms are ignored even after the modelling with an ODE. But the result stated does not state that the implicit bias holds only under this approximation. Hence, the statement in its current form is incorrect.  I am happy to engage in further discussion if the authors bring other points of discussion. 

I also do not agree with the proof technique. a) either start with a discrete time algorithm and ignore the higher order terms to recover the potential which it implicitly minimizes or b) use the continuous time counterpart and state the implicit bias for this without any further approximation. In the approach followed by the paper it is not clear what is the order of approximation of the result (the theorem does not even state that it is an approximate result). There are two errors: one stemming from discretization and the other from neglecting second-order terms. It is not evident how close this trajectory to the one described in Theorem 1. However, I strongly feel that the Theorem 1 should be rewritten and it is not acceptable in its current form. I
