# PyTorch Geometric High Order: A Unified Library for High Order Graph Neural Network

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
We introduce PyTorch Geometric High Order (PyGHO), a library designed for High Order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) built upon PyTorch Geometric (PyG). In contrast to ordinary Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) which facilitate message exchange between nodes and are readily implemented using PyG, HOGNNs, encompassing subgraph GNNs and k-WL GNNs, encode node tuples. Such node tuple encoding lacks a universal framework and often necessitates intricate code implementation. The primary objective of PyGHO is to furnish an intuitive and user-friendly interface catering to various HOGNNs. It integrates streamlined data structures for node tuples, offers comprehensive data preprocessing and mini-batch data loading utilities, presents a versatile framework for high order message propagation, and encompasses a repertoire of representative high order GNN methodologies. In this work, we present an detailed overview of the PyGHO library, elucidating its features, and undertake a comparative analysis of existing HOGNNs implemented with PyGHO on real-world tasks.

### Weaknesses
•	This article is more like an engineering implementation and lacks enough innovation.
•	The experiments are limited in scope - PyGHO is only evaluated on the ZINC molecular dataset for graph property prediction. Testing on more diverse datasets and tasks could better demonstrate its general utility.
•	There is no ablation study on design choices like different tuple sampling strategies or pooling techniques. Exploring the large design space of HOGNNs enabled by PyGHO could provide more insights.
•	Scalability to large graphs is not explored. The focus is on small molecular datasets. Ability to handle large real-world networks is unclear.
•	Adoption and use in downstream applications is not shown. Impact on advancing HOGNN research remains to be demonstrated.
•	There are limited optimizations implemented for sparse data structures. Additional optimizations could improve efficiency further.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new toolbox designed for efficiently implementing a higher-order Message-passing scheme based on PyG.

### Strengths
The paper makes a significant contribution to the efficient implementation of effective higher-order GNNs. The engineering contribution is substantial and noteworthy.

### Weaknesses
The paper could benefit from a comparative analysis between the proposed PyGHO and existing code libraries. The paper restructures the data structure, data loader, and operators in higher-order GNNs, all of which can be achieved with code in PyG. It would be beneficial to provide comparisons of these three components, either empirically or theoretically, between PyGHO and existing methods. The paper provides an overall evaluation of time/memory, which seems somewhat insufficient compared to existing libraries.

### Summary
The paper introduces PyTorch Geometric High Order (PyGHO), a library for High Order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) that extends PyTorch Geometric (PyG).
An open-source library regarding high-order graphs is a good contribution to the community.

### Strengths
An open-source library regarding high-order graphs is a good contribution to the community.

### Weaknesses
Overall, while providing an open-source library is a good contribution to the graph machine learning community, the current state of the paper should be better considered as a workshop submission, rather than a main conference paper submission.
- The paper is obviously below the page limit of 8 pages. It does not seem to be fully finished by the authors.
- The paper provides little technical novelty
- Comparisons with the standard PyG library on standard graph datasets are needed.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a new library, PyGHO, designed for High Order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) based on PyTorch Geometric. The library aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate HOGNN research. Some experiments are conducted to compare the efficiency and performance between implementations using different libraries.

### Strengths
1. It's good to see a new framework with a different angle to facilitate the research in graph learning community
2. The descriptions of the operators are sufficient.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation for designing a new library specifically for HOGNN is not very clear to me. The main claim in the paper is that HOGNN usually generates 2-D (or more) representations which cannot be naturally handled by PyG. But my question is why do we have to naturally support this feature (m-D tuple representations)? Using the example NGNN in the paper, NGNN has a 2-D tensor $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n \times d}$ where $H_{ij}$ represents the node representation of node $j$ in the subgraph $i$. In this case, I am curious why we cannot directly use a list of 1-D tensors where each item contains node representations in a subgraph. If we use this naive implementation/design, are there any disadvantages? In my view, this is the core/fundamental question for designing a new library and it should be clarified clearly. Otherwise, it is a bit difficult to understand the motivation.
2. The empirical experimental results are not very informative. In the results, the authors show that the time spent using the proposed PyGHO is less than the time using the original implementation. But there is no detailed analysis for this. I wonder where the efficiency improvement comes from. I believe that the profiling is needed to have a deeper investigation.
