# A path toward primitive machine intelligence: LMM not LLM is what you need.

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 1, 1, 1

## Abstract
We live in a world where machines with large language models (LLMs) and deep reinforcement learning have shown sparks of super-human intelligence in question-answering and playing strategic boardgames. At the same time, animals continue to reign supreme in the sense of smell, a primitive form of intelligence. Applying the former (deep learning) tricks on large datasets of hyperspectral hardware and spectrometers may well lead to artificial noses that can detect the chemical composition of a mixture. But it comes at the cost of interpretability! 

Here, I propose a path that uses linear mixture models (LMMs) to build an engineering theory of cognitive development for chemosensing. With creative mathematical models, we can derive analytical expressions for the limits of chemosensing and advance the statistical mechanics of learning.

### Rating
1: strong reject

### Rating Number
1

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper outlines some perspectives on the task of chemosensing, where one identifies the chemicals present given sensory data — artificial smelling of sorts. The paper (1) briefly describes a four-stage cognitive theory of chemosensing based on Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, (2) describes classical techniques for inferring the number of chemicals in a set of mixtures based on using eigenvalue cutoffs, PCA, or nonnegative matrix factorization, and (3) briefly discusses other miscellaneous aspects of the problem.

### Strengths
The prose is clear, easy to follow, and enjoyable to read. The authors provide helpful figures, use sections and subsections well.

### Weaknesses
The paper is thin on material. There is a very short explanation of related work, and appears to be no "contributed work" in the paper: no dataset description (although a working example is briefly described), no techniques proposed, no evaluations, etc. It is a brief discussion of the problem of chemosensing. 

I think the area of chemosensing could make for a good machine learning paper, but doing so would require:
- A longer section on related work, contextualizing your approach
- Creating or using a dataset for this task with clear evaluation metrics
- Defining an approach, implementing it, and evaluating it on your dataset
- Show experiments comparing to baselines and understanding how your approach works

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a path towards primitive machine intelligence using linear mixture models (LMMs) for chemosensing. The authors argue that while machines with large language models and deep reinforcement learning have shown sparks of super-human intelligence in certain tasks, animals still reign supreme in primitive forms of intelligence such as smell. By using LMMs, the authors aim to build an engineering theory of cognitive development for chemosensing and advance the statistical mechanics of learning. The paper contributes to the development of a mathematically tractable framework for cognitive development and provides a complementary approach to other paths that focus on more advanced and autonomous intelligence such as natural language understanding and motor development.

### Strengths
**Originality**
Olfaction is an understudied problem, particularly at a venue like ICLR, and any steps towards better understanding it from a machine-learning perspective would likely be novel.

**Quality**
The experiments that are conducted appear sound with appropriate parameter choices.

**Clarity**
Overall, the paper is written in an engaging way. Most statements in the paper are generally clear. Figure 2 is a nice conceptual diagram.

**Signifiance**
As mentioned above, machine olfaction is relatively understudied. Any steps toward a theoretical understanding of it would be significant to the field.

### Weaknesses
In my view, unfortunately, there are several issues with this submission:

First, coverage of related work is not adequate. It is unclear what the prior models of chemosensing are, and how the proposed model differs from prior work.

Secondly, the content of the contributions seems to be lacking. Frankly, beyond motivating the problem that existing methods are unable to learn the true spectrum, I'm struggling to see what this submission contributes, although I may be missing some key aspects of the submission. One possibility to improve this submission's contribution is to derive an analytical scaling law as suggested in Section 2.3.

Third, it is mentioned that one advantage of LMMs is their interpretability. It would be ideal to investigate the interpretability of LMMs experimentally.

Also, the notation is a bit unclear. I would suggest defining the dimensionalities of all the variables as well as making sure all the variables are defined as soon as they are introduced. The author may wish to consider adding a notation table.

**Minor Comments**

"worser than" in Section 2.2

The parameters in Table 2 are not justified or explained

### Questions
How does this work relate to prior work? What is the state of our computational understanding of chemosensing? What is the prior theory on LMMs?

What are the key contributions of this paper?

### Summary
This paper seems somewhat AI-generated, and at the very least not a serious paper. The paper proposes chemo-sensing algorithms but does not provide a concrete problem statement, method, or evaluations beyond some semi-coherent plots. The references are not apt. Overall, I am absolutely not certain this paper passes the Turing test, and definitely not the bar for acceptance at ICLR.
