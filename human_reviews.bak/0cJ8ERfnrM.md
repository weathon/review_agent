# Antibody DomainBed: Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Therapeutic Protein Design

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Recently, there has been an increased interest in accelerating drug design with machine learning (ML). Active ML-guided design of biological sequences with favorable properties involves multiple design cycles in which (1) candidate sequences are proposed, (2) a subset of the candidates is selected using ML surrogate models trained to predict target properties of interest, and (3) sequences are experimentally validated. The returned experimental results from one cycle provide valuable feedback for the next one, but the modifications they inspire in the candidate proposals or experimental protocol can lead to distribution shifts that impair the performance of surrogate models in the upcoming cycle. For the surrogate models to achieve consistent performance across cycles, we must explicitly account for the distribution shifts in their training. We apply domain generalization (DG) methods to develop robust classifiers for predicting properties of therapeutic antibodies. We adapt a recent benchmark of DG algorithms, ``DomainBed,'' to deploy DG algorithms across 5 domains, or design cycles. Our results suggest that foundational models and ensembling (in both output and weight space) lead to better predictive performance on out-of-distribution domains. We publicly release our codebase and the associated dataset of antibody-antigen binding that emulates distribution shifts across design cycles.

### Summary
The authors identify the out-of-distribution problem in designing antibodies across multiple rounds. They propose a benchmark to mimic the distribution shift across different rounds with annotation from computational tools. Several domain generation methods as well as model ensembling in the literature of computer vision are adapted and tested in the scope of drug design on the proposed benchmark. The results suggest ensembling leads to better generalization ability.

### Strengths
1. Optimizing antibodies across multiple rounds is common in real-world applications, and the out-of-distribution problem is also a disturbing phenomenon in practical. Therefore, it is of great significance to formalize and put forward this problem with a suitable benchmark.
2. The authors explore many domain-generalization methods from computer vision, ensemble, as well as different model architecture on the proposed benchmark, which provides necessary basic understanding of the OOD problem in the scope of drug design.

### Weaknesses
1. The biggest concern is the reliability of the computational tools for annotating the binding affinity (i.e. Rosetta). As this work is proposing a benchmark on an important problem which may greatly affect the direction of the community, it is necessary to prove the fidelity of the synthetic labels. More analysis should be incorporated to prove that the computed labels are well aligned with wet-lab validations. For example, the authors can validate the accuracy of the synthetic labels on a dataset with known binding affinity and with a similar distribution to the generated sequences used in the benchmark. However, the best and most direct way might still be sampling a small subset in the benchmark and validate them with wet-lab experiments.
2. Adequate interpretation on the experimental results with respect to the proposed hypothesis is missing. In section 3.1, the authors propose the hypothesis that the causal features might be physico-chemical and geometric properties at the binding interface. However, no further analysis or interpretations on whether the tested DG algorithms have learnt this invariance are provided. Also, in Table 2 and Table 3, vanilla ERM beats most DG methods. Does this mean most of the DG methods can not learn the hypothesized invariance at all?

### Questions
1. In section 6.1, the claim that increasing model size improves performance is not well supported by experiments. As the experiments only compares SeqCNN with ESM2 but not models of the same type with different sizes.
2. Is ENS the abbreviation for "ensemble" in Table 2 and Table 3? And what is the "functional ensemble" mentioned in section 6.1?

### Summary
This paper proposes a benchmark dataset for assessing antibody binding affinity prediction under domain generalization. The paper motivates the need for algorithms in this setting with the rise of ML-guided design of antibodies (as well as small molecules and other biological targets), in which ML models are used to filter down to a set of candidates that are validated experimentally, the resulting data is used to modify the ML models, and the cycle repeats. To this end, the paper compiles a sequence of synthetic datasets where the antigen targets and the antibody candidates are shifted and the binary label of binding affinity is computed using a physics-based computational method. The paper then goes on to benchmark several domain-generalization approaches on these datasets under two different model architectures.

### Strengths
The paper considers an important problem at the intersection of domain generalization and drug design. The paper does a good job of motivating this problem in the context of active drug discovery. The paper also does a fairly extensive comparison of different domain generalization algorithms on their benchmark dataset.

### Weaknesses
There are a few issues with the present paper.

1. The main contribution of the paper is the benchmark dataset. However, based on my reading of this paper, it's unclear whether or not this actually a high-quality dataset. The labels are computed using a single physics-based computational method. There is no validation of the quality of these labels either experimentally or against other computational methods. Given this, it's unclear whether or not good performance on this dataset is actually meaningful.

2. The composition of the benchmark dataset seems to be somewhat arbitrary. The different environments have seemingly randomly chosen compositions of antigens and generative model parameters. There is no justification behind the choice of generative model parameters beyond the statement that changing this parameter varies the similarity between samples and starting seeds.

3. The motivation behind the paper is the active discovery setting. However, there is no evaluation of methods with respect to an active learning setup to demonstrate that better performance on the benchmark dataset leads to better active learning performance.

### Questions
The computational methods appear to produce real-valued results. Why are the results binarized? This would appear to throw out information.


Why do the environments consist of mixtures of antigens? It would seem to me that in a drug discovery setup, one would have a particular target in mind.

### Summary
The paper discusses the important topic of Domain Generalization (DG) applied to the field of antigen discovery.

The paper conducts experiments aimed at proving that ensembling in output and weight space improve DG. There is also a comparison between a SeqCNN baseline and a "foundational" model for protein language.

While the topic of interest at the core of the paper's application is of particularly high interest and it is great that the authors release a new data set as part of the publication, I am not sure one can reach the conclusions of the authors with high confidence based solely on the evidence presented in the current set of experiments.

### Strengths
1) The paper does a very good job in my opinion of explaining the topic of Domain Generalization as part of protein design where multiple rounds of laboratory based evaluation are needed. This is also not dissimilar to other topics in AI where real world experiments help gather more data for instance as a model is deployed under a particular policy. The applicability goes potentially beyond the application presented here.

2) The methods presented to improve DG are not rocket science which does caveat the level of contribution here but also means that implementing the solutions presented by the authors is trivial and therefore industrial applications flow directly from the paper. This is a plus in my opinion as a practitioner.

3) The experiments are well explained and motivated.

### Weaknesses
1) I think that one might want to be a bit more careful when employing the term "foundational model". Some eminent professors in the field of AI have pointed out the somewhat misguiding nature of the term. In a scientific paper, it might be warranted to explain what exactly the authors mean by this term. Do we just mean here a model with good generalization, fine-tuning and zero-shot abilities? Can we give more details as to why the architecture considered here and the data set the model was trained on are a good fit. This is not self-evident IMO.

2) The authors only consider one baseline to compare ESM2 against without really motivating its design. I hate to be the reviewer asking for more baselines but, as such, the conclusion that using foundational models improves solving DG is tenuous based on the evidence given in the paper. More comparisons are needed I believe. At the very least, the level of confidence of the conclusion should be lowered and doubt made explicit.

3) The other conclusions, namely that resembling helps baseline models and that choosing a good validation set is important are really not surprising and do not constitute a substantial contribution. 

4) I think that Figure 6 needs to be a bit more explained in appendix to novices in the field of protein design. But if that's not the target audience, it's fine.

### Questions
1) Could the authors please fix a few typos? The section title 5.3 is not separate from the text above it. Some xlabels in appendix are missing, it looks like the page layout cropped them out.

2) Could the authors adjust the confidence of their conclusion regarding the supremacy of the "foundational" model? While one can expect such a result, since we are entirely relying on experimental comparisons with baselines here, it is very hard to give credence to the claim with just a baseline which looks a bit arbitrarily chosen (I do agree that the design makes intuitive sense but there are other families of models that readers may want to see considered here such as simple RNN, attention models, and combinations of these approaches with CNNs).

### Summary
The paper adds a new type of dataset to the DomainBed benchmark.  The dataset relates to drug discovery, an important area of study and could in principle complement DomainBed.  Despite the reasonably clear presentation of the algorithm for the construction of the data, the characterization and quality of the dataset, as well as the ability to select models and generalize from it in a drug discovery setting, remain unclear.

### Weaknesses
A main weakness of this contribution is the limited nature of this one additional dataset. The dataset is fully synthetic, which the authors explain as necessary due to the high cost of antibody tests in a laboratory setting (and, I imagine, their inability to disclose actual laboratory datasets from ongoing or past projects due to competitive risks).  Although one would hope that the particular distribution shift captures an important mode of the distribution shifts observed during laboratory antibody design, it is not clear if the selection process used here ends up being educational for applications in real world settings.  Perhaps the authors have anecdotal or unpublished evidence supporting such a claim, however, this conclusion is not clear from the writing itself. It does not help that the presented characterization has jargon specialized to the field and terms like MMD (maximal mean discrepancy?) and saliency visualization that are not clarified and have scales that are illegible in the axis labels of Fig 4 and 6.

Although I don't mind people selling their own work as well as they can, I do take issue with one particular statement in page 5 that reads: "Being much larger than small molecules, they are arguably more complex and more challenging to characterize."  This statement is misleading.  Empirically, antibody design in drug discovery settings is dramatically easier than small molecule design as evidenced by the shorter average timescale of the research pipelines prior to reaching development candidates, despite the potentially much more convenient modality of a small molecule therapy if it was comparably complex to design.  The pipelines for dealing with antibodies are well established and antibody production is almost like a printing press compared to those of small molecules, for which some particular designs might take months to years to get right. I agree, however, with the sentiment of the paragraph, namely proteins present unique design challenges and it is thus useful to have an additional benchmark.

### Questions
Do the authors have unpublished evidence of the usefulness of the models selected by this approach in actual drug discovery settings compared to a baseline ERM approach carefully implemented?  

How robust would the conclusions be under sampling of much larger computational datasets (especially more antigens but same process, but also same antigens and more designs)?  The specific construction of the inputs to the different environments basically differ in the seed sequences used in the sampling to generate new sequences that would progress to the next level.  Could it be that the authors always create a perfect setting for ensemble models and simple moving averages?  If showing this conclusion was the main purpose of the paper, are there simpler or additional datasets that could support it?

The particular 8M-parameter ESM2 model that the authors used sounds incredibly small.  It is not clear if that is a necessity (and if so, why), or if it turns out to somehow be sufficient and as good as the next level ESM2 model.

The authors (I believe) presented a closely related work at an ICML symposium this summer.  Was the main change since that presentation the inclusion of additional analysis methods, including the ensembling, or was the dataset itself improved or modified and if so how?
