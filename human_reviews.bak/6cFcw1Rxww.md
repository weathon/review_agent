# Local Search GFlowNets

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized sampling methods that learn a distribution over discrete objects proportional to their rewards. GFlowNets exhibit a remarkable ability to generate diverse samples, yet occasionally struggle to consistently produce samples with high rewards due to over-exploration on wide sample space. 
This paper proposes to train GFlowNets with local search, which focuses on exploiting high-rewarded sample space to resolve this issue. Our main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. This allows biasing the samples toward high-reward solutions, which is not possible for a typical GFlowNet solution generation scheme, which uses the forward policy to generate the solution from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate a remarkable performance improvement in several biochemical tasks. Source code is available: \url{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/ls_gfn}.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes an improvement to the GFlowNet training procedure that biases samples towards the high-reward terminal states. The idea is to train a back-tracking model that would go back from the completed flow trajectory in DAG, and then use the forward model to sample the removed part again.
The method boasts impressive performance on biological sequence design when combined with different objectives for training GFlowNets, and achieves the best performance with Trajectory Balance method.

### Strengths
- The presentation is clear
- The idea is simple and easy to implement
- The evaluation is comprehensive and showcases the strength of the idea

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method adds some computational overhead

### Questions
- How is the number of steps K picked for backtracking? If it's fixed, is there a way to pick it automatically?

### Summary
The paper proposes Local Search GFlowNet (LS-GFN) for training GFlowNets with local search to enhance the training effectiveness. The proposed algorithm explores the local neighborhood through destruction and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements in several biochemical tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an algorithm which combines inter-mode global exploration with intra-mode local exploration in GFlowNets training.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. The proposed algorithm and experimental setup are clearly described.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not declare the sampling complexity of the proposed method. The local search may require more sampling, which can lead to an unfair comparison. 
2. The limitations of the proposed algorithm and potential drawbacks are not discussed in detail.

### Questions
1. What about the sampling complexity of local search? Can you conduct experiments under the same sampling complexity or compare your algorithm with an upper bound sampling times?
2. How to decide the local search interaction I? What about the results with different I?
3. As PRT is adopted in LS-GFN training, is PER used for RL methods in te experiments?

### Summary
- This paper introduces local-search generative flow networks (LS-GFN), a method to improve exploitation in generative flow networks (GFNs).
- The authors argue that, while GFNs explore effectively, their learning is hampered by exploitation — that is, they sample candidate objects that are mostly good but fail to obtain the highest rewards.
- To address this limitation, they propose to refine candidate objects by backtracking
- They validate LS-GFNs on real-world biochemical testbeds, where LS-GFNs significantly outperforms alternatives.
- The paper also includes a well-written introduction to GFNs (Section 3) which covers all the necessary background for the paper.

### Strengths
- Novelty: the method is novel as it cleverly takes advantage of both the probabilistic forward and backward policy of GFNs.
- Significance: the proposed methods exhibits excellent empirical results and drastically outperforms the other baselines. I wish there were more of them, but more on that below.
- Clarity: the paper is well written and provides an exceptionally clear and concise introduction to generative flow networks. Moreover the method is quite simple (I think I could replicate the authors’ results) so it’s likely to be adopted by the community.

### Weaknesses
- While the method itself is simple and well presented, it remains a little unclear the relative importance of different components. For example, the exposition focuses on the trajectory balanced objective — does this mean LS-GFNs don’t work with different training objectives? The paper also mentions building on top of Shen et al., 2023 which introduces prioritized replay training (PRT) to GFNs, but this method doesn’t appear as a baseline — so how much of the improvements are due to PRT and how much is due to the local search?
- In addition to the hyper-parameter $I$ (number of revisions with local searches), I wished the number of backtracking steps and the acceptance rate were also studied — how much tuning did they require in order to get these good results?
- Wall-clock time is never mentioned — how much overhead does the refining process of LS-GFNs incur? How about in terms of sampled states (instead of training rounds)?
- One baseline I wished were included: given a first trajectory, resample the last K steps and only keeping the best candidate. This is akin to beam search in LLMs or go-explore in RL. Other nice-to-have baselines include top-p and top-k sampling.

### Questions
- Why call it “destroy”  since the original trajectory isn’t always discarded? A more intuitive name could be “backtrack”, “rewind”, or anything that doesn’t suggest destruction.
- The top plots in Figure 5 are strange: it looks like some curves go beyond 100% accuracy. Could you either fix them so we can still see the curves on the plot, or explain what is happening?
- How can LS-GFNs recover from a biased backward policy? In other words, assume the forward policy is fine but the backward policy always backtracks to states which yield the same (high reward) candidate objects — how can LS-GFNs overcome this lack of exploration?
- Please confirm that lines 7 and 8 in Algorithm 1 aren’t swapped. If they aren’t (which partially addresses my question above), wouldn’t swapping them and extending $\mathcal{D}$ with $\tau_m$ further improve exploitation? Maybe this should be added as an ablation as well.
