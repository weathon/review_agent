## Abstract
Time series analysis has been an important research area for decades, and with the advent of foundation models, it has witnessed an explosive surge in interest. Contrastive self-supervised learning stands out as a powerful technique to learn representations capable of solving a wide range of downstream tasks. However, there have been several challenges that persist.
First, there is no previous work explicitly considering noise, which is one of the critical factors affecting the efficacy of time series tasks.
Second, there is a lack of efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures that can learn informative representations robust to various downstream tasks. 
To fill in these gaps, we initiate a novel sampling strategy that promotes consistent representation learning with the presence of noise in natural time series. In addition, we propose an encoder architecture that utilizes dilated convolution within the Inception block to create a scalable and robust network architecture with a wide receptive field. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection tasks, e.g. ranks first over two-thirds of the classification UCR datasets, with only 40% of the parameters compared to the second-best approach.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents a self-supervised learning framework that explicitly considers noise and ensures consistent representation given noisy input data. The proposed architecture is also lightweight and efficient. Experiments across three tasks (forecasting, classification, anomaly detection) verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The proposed representation learning framework explicitly takes noise into consideration, and enables consistent representation despite noise in the original data.
2. The proposed model architecture with Inception blocks is lightweight and efficient.
3. Extensive experiments on three time-series related downstream datasets demonstrate promising performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The direct forecasting baselines compared in the paper are no longer the state of the art. Including more recent baselines like PatchTST and DLinear could better showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparative analysis.
2. The diversity of forecasting datasets seems limited, focusing only on the electricity domain. 
3. How to quantify the performance improvement with respect to the noise levels in the original datasets? For example, do higher noise levels in the original datasets correspond to larger performance improvement after adopting the proposed noise-resilient approach?
4. The choice of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for denoising, as opposed to other frequency-domain denoising techniques like high-frequency component filtering post-Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), needs further clarification.
5. The paper could benefit from clarifying any underlying assumptions about the noise characteristics, such as whether the noise needs to be additive rather than multiplicative in relation to the original time series.

### Summary
Ths paper proposes three improvements to learn a better representation of time series data, especially under noise situation. The three parts  are a novel sampling strategy, an enhanced dilated convolutional encoder, and a new triplet loss. The experiments on different domains of time series dataset, show consistent improvement over the state-of-the-art TS2VEC model.

### Strengths
1. The authors provide ablation study on how effective of each proposed components, and show all of them contributes to the final improvement.
2. The testing dataset is ocmprehensive, including popular UCR, UEA, Yahoo, etc. The results are evaluated on most of the subset in each repository.
3. The domain of experiments is also comprehensive, including forecasting, classification, abnormaly detection, etc. A consistent improvement on all the domain and all the dataset make the contribution very solid.

### Weaknesses
1. It might be better to see an additional ablation study on the encoder architecture, as the authors also proposes 3 changes on the original encoder.
2. The noise reduction is demonstrated in Figure 2, but it is hard to tell what to expect from the figure. I would suggest using some statistics to show the closeness between the embeddings of original time series and the perturbed ones.

### Questions
The noise reduction effect is mainly attributes to which of the three proposed compoenents?

### Summary
This paper presents a new time-series representation learning strategy with contrastive learning, which highlights the importance of handling noise. Specifically, they propose the noise-resilient sampling strategy to find the positive and negative pairs where different views of the data samples are created from the spectral domain instead of the temporal domain. They present a new time-series encoder that leverages Inception and Dilation to achieve efficiency and wide receptive field at the same time.

### Strengths
1. Their proposed new encoder architecture is both lightweight and able to look at a wide receptive field.
2. They’ve conducted extensive experiments to show the advantages of their proposed methods in time-series representation learning in the tasks of forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection.

### Weaknesses
1. One of the key assumptions that the authors make is that noise is usually in high frequency, citing two reference papers (Lanting et al., 2011 and Oohashi et al., 2000). But I highly doubt whether this is the case in general. The 1st reference paper (Lanting et al., 2011) focuses on a very niche case (Macroscopic Resonant Tunneling), while the key insight of the 2nd one (Oohashi et al., 2000) is not even related based on my glimpse at the abstract of that paper. Thus, I would doubt the usefulness of the proposed method.
2. Writing and English need to be improved. I’ll give 3 examples but there are more scattering around the entire paper. (1) for Figure 2, it is very confusing which part I should be looking at when reading the corresponding text in Section 2.2. (2) On page 4, it is confusing what level $j$ refers to without further explanation (I could sort of infer it means the $j$-th dimension of $\mathbf{x}$). (3) The long paragraph on Page 5 should be better structured and many sentences in it are informal and unprofessional. I would suggest the authors read through the paper before submitting it.

### Questions
I have included some of the questions in the part of Weakness. Other than that:
- What are the characteristics of datasets that you expect your proposed method to work better on? For example, do they tend to have noise in distinct frequencies or require longer sequence dependence?

### Summary
The paper presents "CoInception," a framework for time series representation learning that is both noise-resilient and efficient. Recognizing the challenges in time series analysis such as the presence of noise and the need for lightweight yet robust encoders, the authors present a novel sampling strategy alongside an encoder architecture designed to enhance noise resilience and task performance. Their sampling strategy utilizes a spectral low-pass filter to generate noise-invariant representations, ensuring that key time series features are preserved while reducing the influence of noise. For encoding, they combine Inception blocks with dilated convolutions to capture long-range dependencies within a scalable network architecture that remains computationally efficient.
The proposed framework is validated through experiments, showing superior performance in forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks compared to existing methods. CoInception achieves this with fewer parameters, highlighting its efficiency.

### Strengths
The paper certainly represents a significant amount of work by the authors, especially in the experimental section. The related work section is also extensive.

### Weaknesses
The paper does not do a good job positioning itself in the vast literature of timeseries modeling. It is not clear how the paper extends the state of the art in this area, and whether/how the proposed method is new compared to some fairly basic signal processing concepts, such as low-pass filtering to reduce noise.

### Questions
The paper does not do a good job positioning itself in the vast literature of timeseries modeling. Some key statements in the paper show this issue more clearly. For example:

"A common shortcoming emerges in existing methods: none explicitly address noise in time series data alongside an appropriate strategy for handling this unwanted signal. Unlike other data types, real-world time series often harbor substantial noise, severely impacting task accuracy"

This statement is hard to accept. Of course all or most prior work in this area considers that the time series will be noisy. This is one of the main reasons we use neural networks, as opposed to other models that are much less capable to deal with noisy data. 

Then, there are some sentences that are hard to understand. For example: 

"we devise a sampling strategy based on the insight that the noisy signal combined with the original series shouldn’t disrupt time series frameworks. In essence, frameworks should produce consistent representations given noise-free or raw series (noise-resiliency characteristics)."

What "Frameworks" are the authors talking about? 

Additionally, there are some aspects of the model, or claims about the model, that are very basic but they are presented as an important technical contribution. For example:

"To achieve this, we shift our focus from the temporal domain to the spectral domain. Here, we employ a spectrum-based low-pass filter to create correlated yet distinct views of each input time series. These augmented views serve as positive samples of the raw series, effectively capturing the desired noise invariance. The advantages of this low-pass filter-based augmentation are twofold: (1) the filter preserves key characteristics such as trend and seasonality, ensuring deterministic and interpretable representations; (2) it eliminates noise-prone high-frequency components, improving noise resilience and enhancing downstream task performance by aligning the raw signal representation with the augmented view"

Of course there is nothing particularly new in the previous paragraph. Working in the spectral domain and performing LPF to remove high-frequency noise are elementary operations that are typically taught at the level of undergraduate signal processing courses. 
 
Considering the previous weaknesses, it is hard to provide specific technical comments to the authors, given that (at least to this reviewer) it is not clear if the paper has something really new to contribute in the area of timeseries modeling.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework called CoInception for time series representation learning. It addresses the challenges of noise and lack of efficient encoder architectures in time series tasks. The framework utilizes a noise-resilient sampling strategy and an encoder architecture with dilated convolution within the Inception block. Experimental results show that CoInception outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks. The authors investigates the existence and impacts of noise in time series representation learning and introduces a noise-resilient sampling strategy to learn consistent representations despite the noise.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper introduces a novel noise-resilient sampling strategy and an efficient encoder architecture, which are not explicitly considered in previous works. It investigates the existence and impacts of noise in time series representation learning, addressing a critical factor that affects the efficacy of time series tasks.

Quality: The authors provide empirical validation of the proposed CoInception framework and compares it with recent state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating consistent outperformance in forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection tasks. The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the framework in learning informative representations robust to various downstream tasks.

Clarity: The paper clearly presents the motivation, challenges, and contributions of the research, as well as the design principles of the framework. It also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, highlighting the best results for better comparison.

Significance: The authors address the gap in existing works by exploring the potential of unsupervised representation learning in time series data. The proposed framework offers a solution for learning informative representations without the need for costly and difficult labeling, particularly in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare and finance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating its significance in advancing time series analysis.

### Weaknesses
1.This paper appears to be making modifications on top of TS2Vec, incorporating a denoising module and enhancing the encoder, which limits the novelty of this paper.

2.The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed noise-resilient sampling strategy and encoder architecture. This could hinder a deeper understanding of the trade-offs and potential challenges in implementing and applying the CoInception framework in real-world scenarios.

3.Lack of comparison with more recent and diverse state-of-the-art methods in time series representation learning, beyond the ones mentioned in the paper. This could limit the comprehensive evaluation of the proposed CoInception framework and its performance against a wider range of approaches.

### Questions
1. In real-world time series data, there may be some high-frequency components. As mentioned by the authors, the DWT method in this paper is capable of filtering out high-frequency noise. How can useful high-frequency data be preserved and what trade-offs are made in addressing this issue?

2. Could you provide a clearer explanation of the Inception Block in the Method section, including an explanation of the meanings of variables like $b$ and $h$ in Figure 3 (a), as well as the significance of the numbers in brackets? This would help in better understanding this paper.

3. The comparison with baselines could be more comprehensive. I believe it would be more convincing if the authors could compare their method to recent approaches from the past two years, such as TimesNet [1].
