- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
In the real world, the strong episode resetting mechanisms that are needed to train
agents in simulation are unavailable. The resetting assumption limits the potential
of reinforcement learning in the real world, as providing resets to an agent usually
requires the creation of additional handcrafted mechanisms or human interventions.
Recent work aims to train agents (forward) with learned resets by constructing
a second (backward) agent that returns the forward agent to the initial state. We
find that the termination and timing of the transitions between these two agents
are crucial for algorithm success. With this in mind, we create a new algorithm,
Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC) which intelligently
switches between the two agents based on the agent’s confidence in achieving its
current goal. Our new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
challenging environments for reset-free RL.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to tackle the challenge of training reinforcement learning agents in real-world scenarios without relying on strong episode resetting mechanisms. The authors propose a method called Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC) that learns to switch between controllers intelligently. RISC addresses the crucial aspects of managing state bootstrapping during controller transitions and determining when to switch between controllers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging environments for reset-free RL, including sparse and dense reward tasks, though the authors suggest further exploration of new environments or enhanced difficulty levels. However, a limitation of RISC is its potential unsuitability for environments with irreversible states, where safety concerns may arise. Additionally, the paper acknowledges the absence of leveraging demonstrations for agent guidance, which could be an interesting direction for future research.

### Strengths
The paper's key strength lies in its innovative approach to addressing the underexplored aspect of learning when switching between controllers in reset-free reinforcement learning. By recognizing the absence of an imposed episode time limit in this setting and considering the duration of controller trajectories as a parameter, the authors introduce a novel concept: dynamically learning when to switch controllers based on the agent's ability to achieve its current goal. This intelligent switching mechanism not only optimizes the agent's experience collection but also facilitates more efficient learning by focusing on unmastered states and goals. The proposed algorithm, Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC), is evaluated on a challenging benchmark of robot manipulation and navigation tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in various reset-free environments. This novel approach to controller switching has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness of reset-free reinforcement learning algorithms, addressing an important and previously unexplored aspect of the field.

### Weaknesses
- The paper has no significant theoretical results.
- The convergence of the proposed method is not guaranteed.
- Too many hyperparameters to tune, e.g., minimum trajectory length, conservative factor...

### Questions
- In the last paragraph of 4.2.1, could the author explain more about why we should set $\gamma_{sc}$ to be the value of the critic's discount factor?
- Could the author explain more about how the method makes the learning stable?
- I suppose the work will benefit the reward-free RL (Yang, Q., & Spaan, M. T. (2023). CEM: Constrained Entropy Maximization for Task-Agnostic Safe Exploration. AAAI-2023). Could the author elaborate a bit on how to use the ideas in reward-free RL for exploration?

### Summary
Summary:
The paper addresses the reset-free reinforcement learning (RL) setting, which assumes the absence of a reset mechanism, making it a more realistic scenario due to the potential cost associated with resets in the real world. Existing RL methods typically train two separate agents: one toward the goal and another toward the initial state, aiming to bring the agent back to the initial state for additional practice. This paper contends that intelligently switching between these two agents, particularly when the agent is competent, is crucial. Furthermore, the addition of bootstrapping for the last state before switching is shown to significantly enhance performance. The proposed method, referred to as RISC, outperforms state-of-the-art reset-free RL methods on four EARL tasks (a common reset-free RL benchmark) and a four-room navigation task.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written, experiments are well-executed, and details of implementations are reported.

2. The paper raises a significant concern regarding the handling of time-out non-terminal states in RL, which is often overlooked. It emphasizes the importance of correctly handling bootstrapping particularly in the reset-free context.

3. The concept of intelligently switching between two different agents is intriguing, opening the door to further research in this direction.

### Weaknesses
1. One important argument this paper makes is that adding bootstrapping for time-out non-terminal states is important, although it is theoretically well motivated, I think it would be better to see some practical motivations, especially why it is important under the reset-free setting. For example, are value estimations very different?

2. The paper introduces several method-specific hyper-parameters such as M, m, and β. It would be valuable to discuss the method's sensitivity and robustness to these hyper-parameters.

### Questions
1. Will code be available?

2. Are there any correlations between adding bootstrapping and adding an intelligent switch? For example, will switch be **more** useful when bootstrapping is added? 

3. If I understand correctly, a separate critic success function was trained. Why didn't the authors use the critic from SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) instead of training a new one?

4. In EARL paper, they claimed not using bootstrapping can break the long TD chain, in contrast, this paper suggests using bootstrap. Could authors also discuss these two different ideas?

5. Bootstrapping for time-out non-terminal states should always be performed, do you have any intuitions on is it more important in the reset-free setting, since in episodic RL setting, people generally just ignore it? 

6. At the beginning of section 5.1, the paper discusses RC and RISC. Could you please elaborate more on RC and the difference between these two agents? Does RC also use bootstrapping? 

7. Analysis on Fig.3 (the last paragraph of section 5.1), you mentioned the RISC agent tends to visit areas where Q-values are low. But in the third/fourth column of Fig.3, it seems like the RC agent also tends to visit areas where Q-values are low? In the third column, the RISC agent actually gathers lots of data in the first room where Q-values are already quite high.

8. There’s a performance drop on sawyer peg tasks, do you have any intuitions on the decrease of performance?

9. Which task do you perform ablation study on in Fig.6?

10. You mentioned demo data is put into the replay buffer, do you oversample it? Will RISC perform the same without demo data?

11. There's a recent work called IBC (Demonstration-free Autonomous Reinforcement Learning via Implicit and Bidirectional Curriculum) from ICML 2023. While it is relatively new, it may be worth discussing it in the related work section without the need for experimental comparisons.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of reset-free RL where automatic reset does not apply. Different from existing work, this paper proposes a new algorithm that switchs between forward and backward controllers intelligently. More specifically, the proposed switching function take the competent of state into account when the specific state has been explored well.  For this purpose, a Q-learning style algorithm is proposed to estimate the competency of a policy in a specific state. Through empirical experiments, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve better performance comparing to the baselines on benchmarks.

### Strengths
The considered problem in this paper is interesting and has great potential in real applications as episodic RL could be hard to achieve. 
In terms of different terminal strategies, this paper theoretically analyze different terminal strategies in term of bootstrapping for the final state. As timeout-terminal strategy bring more challenges to the problem, it is more recommended to have timeout-terminal loss when switching controllers. The analysis is rigorous and easy to follow. 
The idea of defining and learning the competent of state and policy for preventing unnecessary exploration is cogent.

### Weaknesses
Although the idea of switching according to competent makes sense, I have some concerns regarding the limitations of the proposed switching function. In order to have valid result, you need additional mechanisms to modulate the frequency of switching. It could be tricky to tune \epsilon,\beta, and the minimum length. There is always a tradeoff here, as you increase the constraints, your proposed method will gain less benefits.

### Questions
In the paper, the authors did not explain details about the hyperparameters needed in the proposed algorithm. In 4.2.2, there is some description. But I did not see any insight on how to tune these three parameters in different scenarios. And these parameters are essential for the algorithm to work properly. I would like to read more on this.

### Summary
The paper presents Reset Free RL with Intelligently Switching Controller (RISC), a novel algorithm for reinforcement learning in reset-free environments. RISC intelligently switches between two agents: a forward agent that learns the task and a backward agent that resets the agent to favorable states. The key ideas are proper bootstrapping when switching controllers and learning when to switch between the agents. The authors demonstrate that RISC achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging environments from the EARL benchmark.

### Strengths
* RISC addresses the limitations of episodic RL in real-world applications, where resetting the environment is expensive and difficult to scale.
* The algorithm intelligently switches between forward and backward agents, maximizing experience generation in unexplored areas of the state space.
* RISC achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging environments from the EARL benchmark.

### Weaknesses
* The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the theoretical properties of RISC, such as convergence guarantees.
* The experiments are limited to a small set of environments, and it is unclear how RISC would perform on more complex tasks or in other domains.

### Questions
* How does RISC compare to other reset-free RL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and generalization?
* Can RISC be extended to handle environments with irreversible states, where the agent could get stuck?
* How does RISC perform when combined with other techniques, such as curriculum learning or demonstration-based learning?
