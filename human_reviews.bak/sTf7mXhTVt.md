# Query Efficient  Black-Box  Adversarial Attack with Automatic Region Selection

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to black-box attacks in which small perturbations are added to input images without accessing any internal information of the model. However, current black-box adversarial attack methods are limited to attacks on entire regions, pixel-wise sparse attacks, or region-wise attacks. In this paper, we investigate region-wise adversarial attacks in the black-box setting, using automatic region selection and controllable imperceptibility.
Technically, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem with $\ell_0^{\mathcal{G}}$ and $\ell_\infty$ constraints. Here, $\ell_0^{\mathcal{G}}$ represents structured sparsity defined on one collection of groups $\mathcal{G}$, which can automatically detect the regions that need to be perturbed. We solve the problem using the algorithm of natural evolution strategies with search gradients.
If $\mathcal{G}$ is non-overlapping, we provide a closed-form solution to the first-order Taylor approximation of the objective function with the search gradient having $\ell_0^{\mathcal{G}}$ and $\ell_\infty$ constraints (FTAS$\ell_{0+\infty}^{\mathcal{G}}$). If $\mathcal{G}$ is overlapping, we provide an approximate solution to FTAS$\ell_{0+\infty}^{\mathcal{G}}$ due to its NP-hard nature, using greedy selection on the collection of groups $\mathcal{G}$. Our method consists of multiple updates with the closed-form/approximate solution to FTAS$\ell_{0+\infty}^{\mathcal{G}}$. We provide the convergence analysis of the solution under standard assumptions. Our experimental results on different datasets indicate that we require fewer perturbations compared to global-region attacks, fewer queries compared to region-wise attacks, and better interpretability into vulnerable regions which is not possible with pixel-wise attacks.

### Summary
This paper presents FTAS, a novel algorithm for region-wise adversarial attacks in a black box setting. Existing region-wise attacks heuristically determine the perturbation region, which leads to a bad attack performance. FTAS automatically determines the perturbation region with controllable imperceptibility by solving an optimization problem that considers the perturbation region selection.
This paper provides the theoretical convergence analysis of the solution obtained by FTAS under standard assumptions.
Experimental results on different datasets indicate that FTAS requires fewer perturbations than the global-region attack and fewer queries than existing region-wise attacks. In addition, FTAS provides better interpretability on vulnerable regions, which is impossible with pixel-wise sparse attacks.

### Strengths
The strengths of this paper include followings.
1. This study introduces a novel formulation that incorporates region selection as a constraint in region-wise attacks and presents the FTAS algorithm.
2. FTAS outperforms existing methods, requiring fewer perturbations than global-region attacks and fewer queries than region-wise attacks.
3. FTAS offers enhanced interpretability of vulnerable region of inputs, which is impossible with pixel-wise sparse attacks.

### Weaknesses
Although this paper presents a new formulation for sparse and effective adversarial attacks, concerns exist regarding the gap between the problem to be solved and that actually solved, as well as the theoretical performance guarantees of the algorithm.
1. To minimize $F(x_0 + \delta, y)$ under some constraints, the authors solve the problem (5) derived from inequalities originating from the smoothness of $F$ and the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. However, it is important to note that problem (5) does not necessarily entail the minimization of $F(x_0 + \delta, y)$.
2. This paper relies on the assumptions of RSC and RSS to provide a theoretical guarantee for the performance of Algorithm 1. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that this assumption may not necessarily hold, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks involving complex neural networks.
3. The performance of Algorithm 1 is theoretically guaranteed by Theorem 2. However, the authors do not discuss the tightness of the bound. Notably, the right-hand side of the inequality established in Theorem 2 incorporates the variable $\rho^T$. Consequently, if $\rho>1$, the right-hand side of the inequality may diverge towards positive infinity as $T$ approaches infinity.

Additionally, minor comments:
4. Clarity issues arise in certain parts of the text due to the identical formatting of vectors and scalars.
5. The horizontal axis label in Figure 4 might require correction.
6. In the opening sentence of Section 2.2, it would be more appropriate to replace the phrase "we propose a new objective function for adversarial training" with "we propose a new problem formulation for adversarial attacks."

### Questions
I kindly ask the authors to answer the following questions.
1. Is the assumption of gradient Lipschitz continuity reasonable for adversarial attacks?
2. Is the assumption 1 reasonable for adversarial attacks?
3. Does theorem 2 provide meaningful performance bound of the algorithm 1 in practice?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper considers a novel attack setting, namely, region-based attack that lies in between the pixel-wise and the global attacks and allows additional interpretability of the final perturbation. They evaluate their attack on different datasets such as ImageNet, MNIST and CIFAR and compare to existing methods such as AutoZoom and Square attack etc with respect to numerous performance metrics.

### Strengths
-	The paper considers an interesting approach to crafting black-box adversarial examples and compare it to existing paradigms with respect to different aspects.

-	The theoretical background of the method seems to be reasonable

### Weaknesses
-	The proposed method is outperformed on ImageNet by existing Square Attack (Table 14 in Appendix D.3). Please include this table in the main part of the paper (at least in some reduced form) or comment on this aspect explicitly. Knowing comparative performance on high-resolution images is important for the readers to get full picture of the method's strengths and weaknesses.

-	Please add median number of queries for your ImageNet experiments in Table 14 as you did for CIFAR10 and MNIST in Tables 3, 4. Just the average number of queries is not sufficient in my opinion. 

-	Figure 5 is rather misleading because for the Square Attack in the second row we only see stripe initializaton without any sampled squares. If it is an adversarial example, then it has fooled the image with a single query. It doesn’t provide a good visual impression of what a Square Attack perturbation typically looks like.

### Questions
- Could you elaborate on why fixed versions of existing attacks (e. g. Fixed-ZO-NGD) would be valuable baselines? The attacks were not designed that way and introducing this additional constraint seems to be an unclear step to me. 
- Why would considering $\ell_{\infty}$ and $\ell_2$ metrics simultaneously e. g. in Table 2 be significant? If we wanted to minimize them simultaneously with the baseline attacks that you consider, we could include it as another term in the loss that they are trying to optimize. Have you considered such modifications to obtain better baselines?

### Summary
This paper provides a region-wise black-box attack method. It automatically identifies relevant regions based on a dependable standard, rather than relying on fixed regions or heuristics. It treats the problem as an optimization problem with technical constraints, namely lG0 and l∞. lG0 represents structured sparsity defined within a specific collection of groups G, enabling the automatic detection of regions requiring perturbation. The optimization is solved using a natural evolution strategies algorithm. It also discusses the group overlapping separately. When G doesn’t overlap, the author uses a closed-form solution for the first-order Taylor. When G overlaps, it adopts an approximate solution by using a greedy selection on G. The convergence of the algorithm is also discussed. In the experiments, the authors compare its performance with global region and pixel-wise attack models. Demonstrating good performances compared with baseline methods.

### Strengths
+ The authors provided a convergency analysis of the attack methods, which would be useful when a guarantee of the model robustness is needed.
+ Experiments have been done on large-scale image datasets, and comparison has been done with recent black-box attack methods.

### Weaknesses
- Some descriptions are confusing. For example, at the beginning of sec. 2.2,  '... we propose a new objective function for adversarial training ...' while it should be 'adversarial attack'? Also, there are many notations that appear without definition. Like what is I_G in Theorem 1? Besides, the deduction in sec. 3.1 seems to be unnecessary, and the gradient estimation proposed in equ. (4) does not seem to differ from the standard gradient estimation approach.
- For computational cost and convergence, it only says high, medium and low. Are there any quantitative results to demonstrate it? 
- It is not clear how the algorithm performs region selection. In algorithm 1, how the delta^0 is initialised? What is the initial perturbation group set G? 
- Using the estimated gradient to perform black-box adversarial attacks is not new. Please refer to the SPSA attack [1].
- In the experiment section. I am not sure if the comparison is fair, as different black-box attacks select different regions. Besides, the result shows that the proposed methods may actually require more queries as the median is significantly higher than other models. Also, the authors used a simple CNN for the CIFAR10 dataset. It would be more convincing to evaluate pre-trained models from PyTorch model zoo or other resources.
- As the authors conducted a convergence analysis of the proposed attack. I am wondering if this can be further developed towards an adversarial verification method. Also, the robustness verification of adversarial patches has been done in [2]. I am also interested in the performance of the proposed attack on such a certified defence.

### Summary
This papers focus on black-box adversarial attacks where the objective is to construct strong adversarial perturbations with only query-access to the black box deep neural network. The novelty of the proposed work lies in the automatic region selection approach based on natural evolution strategy, which can even be derived as a closed-form solution for non-overlapping patches. It further demonstrates the success of the proposed attack on mnist, cifar 10, and imagenet dataset.

### Strengths
This paper is very well written and the evaluation pipeline is rigorous. Authors have evaluated the attack's strength both analytically and empirically across three datasets and multiple different ablations.

### Weaknesses
Query efficiency: I couldn’t find the comparison on how efficient is the current attack w.r.t the previous attacks. When permitted a high number of queries, the strength of most black-box attacks would increase, thus making it an unfair comparison in table 2.

Second, it is critical to provide the number of queries vs attack strength to identify the pareto optimal curve of the current attack (currently the number of queries are set to fixed 10k, 40k - not sure why?). Similarly it is necessary to compare queries vs ASR plot with other attacks. 

Are there diminishing returns in attack success with higher resolution? While the proposed attack appears to be stronger and less perceptible than baselines of small resolution datasets (cifar10, mnist), the trend doesn’t fully hold on ImageNet dataset (table 14 in appendix). Square attack [1] achieves equally high success rate and lower average queries.

### Questions
Can authors clarify how the attack complexity behaves with experimental setup, i.e., input resolutions, size of neural networks, number of classes, etc?

Can authors provide additional intuition of why the proposed approach has higher ASR than similar black-box attacks, e.g., square attacks? Is it because of attack strength or subtle design choices, such as patch based perturbations.
