# Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Federated learning (FL) is a novel approach to machine learning that allows multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a model without disclosing their raw data. However, several challenges hinder the practical implementation of this approach, especially when devices and the server communicate over wireless channels, as it suffers from communication and computation bottlenecks in this case. By utilizing a communication-efficient framework, we propose a novel zero-order (ZO) method with two types of gradient estimators, one-point and two-point, that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel without requiring the knowledge of the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. The two main difficulties of this work are that in FL, the objective function is usually not convex, which makes the extension of FL to ZO methods challenging, and that including the impact of wireless channels requires extra attention. However, we overcome these difficulties and comprehensively analyze the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework. We establish its convergence theoretically, and we prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ with the one-point estimate and $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ with the two-point one in the nonconvex setting. We further demonstrate the potential of our algorithms with experimental results, taking into account independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID device data distributions.

### Summary
The authors first propose a zero-order method with two types of gradient estimators to solve the federated learning problems in the wireless communication environment. The proposed framework ZOFL doesn’t require the knowledge of channel state. Moreover, the authors prove the almost surely convergence and give the convergence rate. Finally, the authors test the performance of ZOFL with experimental results.

### Strengths
The proposed algorithm ZOFL is novel and interesting in my point of view. (1) Despite using the zeroth-order method in optimization problems is not a new thing, the proposed algorithm includes the channel state as a part of learning and doesn’t need to analyze the channel, which has not been seen in the literature. (2) Theoretically, the proposed paper proves the almost surely convergence instead of convergence in probability by utilizing Doob’s martingale inequality.

### Weaknesses
Despite that the paper proposes an attractive novelty, I suspect some technical proofs have some small problems, which I list in the questions part. It is possible that I’m wrong. Thus, if the authors can explain these questions, I will change my score.

### Questions
(1) In the last line of Eq. (15), How E[h_{i,k+1}^2 h_{i,k}^2] be bounded by \sigma_h^4? Shouldn’t any two of them be related? Similarly, how E[h_{i,k+1}^2 \sum_{j<l}h_{j,k}h_{l,k}] be bounded by K_{hh}^2 since j and k cannot be equal to i at the same time?

(2) In the appendix C1 page 18, whey g_k and g_k’ are independent if k\neq k’? since g_k includes h_k and h_{k+1}. If k’=k+1, shouldn’t they be related? This problem also influences the derivation of the following proofs which use Doob’s martingale inequality.

(3) In the Eq (27) on page 20, how can you guarantee that \rho-\eps-L\sqrt{c}\alpha_{k_l} is positive? If not, the inequality cannot be squared and used in Eq. (28) I think.

Besides the above questions, this paper also has some typos, which I list here.

(1)	In equation (11) equality (c), where does the ‘2N’ come from in the second term? 
(2)	In equation (12), a vector \Phi_k is missing before the Hessian matrix.
(3)	In equation (15) inequality (a) where does the ‘N’ come from? Giving the assumption 2 ||\Phi_k||^2 should be directly bounded by \alpha_3^2. I don’t think Cauchy Schwarz works here.
(4)	1/\nu^2 is missing in inequality (a) on page 19 in Appendix C1.
(5)	In Eq. (30) the conditional expectation notation is missing.

### Summary
The authors have considered the federated learning problem over wireless channels. The proposed zero-order method optimizes this process over wireless channels, integrating channel characteristics directly into the algorithm. The authors have provided convergence analysis and experiments for the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to read. 

- The authors have provided theoretical analysis and experiments for the proposed techniques.

### Weaknesses
- The motivation of the work is not clear. 
- The authors have mentioned a setting in which server and clients are communicating via wireless challenges, but the unique challenges due to this setting are not clearly mentioned. 
- Why a zeroth order method would address the challenges due to wireless communication setting is not clear. 
- The authors have motivated the use of single point estimates of gradients via mentioning that the ''settings are continuously changing over time", but it is not cleat what settings are referred to here?
- Also, in FL setting, the stochastic gradients a usually easily available, so what is the main motivation behind going for zeroth order optimization? 
- It seems like the authors are trying to look at the physical layer aspect of federated learning? But does it require to change the FL algorithm ?
- The authors have mentioned about sharing the gradients with the server, but in most of the FL techniques, the core idea is to just share the models with the server, what is the motivation to share the gradients? 
- Since the authors are considering to study the impact of wireless impact on FL, it would require to consider the wireless communication settings. In the wireless channel model Hg + n, g is usually the encoded bits which we transmit. But here the authors have used directly g, should it be something like b(g) instead of g directly? 

- It is unclear why considering the effect of wireless channels directly in the algorithm updates would have additional benefits. On the other hand, it would add another challenge of getting to know the channel estimating for each device at each instant of transition. 

- How are the convergence bounds related to other results in the literature such as with FedAvg, FedProx et? 
- The analysis looks like follows directly from the existing analysis of FL techniques in the literature, what are the additional challenges?

### Summary
This study presents a framework that introduces a zero-order method with one-point and two-point gradient estimators. Unlike previous methods, it directly integrates the wireless channel into the learning algorithm, addressing non-convex FL objectives and channel complexities. The authors theoretically prove the convergence of this zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the convergence behavior for both one-point and two-point estimations compared to FedAvg through experiments with different binary distribution scenarios.

### Strengths
The authors propose two zero-order gradient estimators for FL, which include the noisy wireless channel in the gradient estimation.

The authors provide a theoretical analysis of their proposed estimators and prove the convergence of their FL algorithms in the non-convex setting.

The authors conduct a comparison of their proposed zero-order FL algorithm with FedAvg.

### Weaknesses
In the abstract, the authors provide theoretical convergence results as a function of K as well as throught the main paper without defining what K represents. 

In the introduction, the authors use "they," but it is unclear to what it refers. Does it refer to all previous works or to the authors in the work they cite?

In the motivation section, specifically in the "communication bottleneck" paragraph, the authors discuss allowing partial participation to reduce the communication bottleneck. The authors could discuss works that optimized the partial participation to reduce the required number of communication rounds, such as power-of-choice, filfl, and divfl. Even in the experiments, they only compare to FedAvg, while several other variants show fewer communication rounds.

While the authors focus on the non-convex setting in their theoretical analysis, it would be interesting to see the convergence rate in the (strongly) convex setting as well.

I think section 2.3 should precede section 2.2 for better clarity. One needs to understand the estimators of the gradients before delving into the final algorithm.

It is very unclear why the authors only consider binary classification tasks, which seem very simple to learn. This makes it difficult to judge the quality of their proposed solution. We need to see if their proposed algorithm works well in settings with multiple classes.

### Questions
Can the authors explain why it is particularly interesting to train clients in the wireless setting and include the noisy channel in their estimation rather than using wireless communication protocols to encode and decode messages (if needed) and then conducting FedAvg or variants of FedAvg? By construction of the algorithm, the clients send much less but much more frequently. Why and when is this a more interesting approach?

Why the algorithm only considers even integers k?

In section 2.3, Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 do not include the terms "d/2*gamma" and "d/gamma," respectively, as defined in the introduction. Can the authors explain the reason for that?

While their proposed solution is a zero-order method, why the authors did not compare to previous zero-order methods as well as other variants of FedAvg with optimized client participation. 

Can the authors explain why they only consider binary classification tasks in their empirical results? Will their approach perform well in scenarios with multiple classes?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper uses zeroth-order optimization in federated learning over wireless channels with unknown channel gains. The main advantage is to reduce the communication overhead, since clients only need to transmit scalar values to the server in the case of zeroth-order optimization.

### Strengths
- The reduction of client-to-server communication by leveraging zeroth-order optimization is interesting.

### Weaknesses
- The main Algorithms 1 and 2 rely on Equations (3) and (4) to provide gradient estimates. However, Equations (3) and (4) do not provide estimated gradients due to the unknown channel gain $h\_{j,k}$ and noise $n_{j,k}$ terms. The channel gain and noise can drift the parameter update $\Phi_k$ to arbitrary directions. Since they are unknown, the direction of the gradient remains unknown and the multiplication of $\Phi_k$ in Equations (3) and (4) may not yield a gradient vector in the correct direction. With possibly incorrect gradient estimates, it is unclear how the algorithms can converge to the correct solution.
- The system model multiplies the channel gains directly with the values transmitted by clients. It seems some kind of analog transmission without channel coding is considered. However, in practice, all cellular communication nowadays use digital communication with encoding, where the resulting bit error or noise will have very different mathematical expressions. The current system model and result does not seem to extend to such practical systems. It is further unclear why there is no channel considered in server-to-client communication (Line 3 in Algorithms 1 and 2).
- The experiments are simplified and do not really have a baseline that is compared with, since FedAvg runs in an idealized setting without channel effects. The paper should compare with baselines in the same system setup (i.e., with channel effects of the same statistics). Some well-known FL algorithms with communication efficiency, such as top-k parameter compression with error feedback, should be compared with too.
- Only very simple binary classification tasks using MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets and simple models have been considered in the experiments. It is not clear how the algorithms perform with more advanced datasets and models. 
- The writing of the paper needs significant improvement. To me, the main contributions (and especially the usefulness of such contributions) remained unclear before page 5, while pages 6-8 include mostly a list of mathematical assumptions and results with only a limited amount of explanation on what it is useful and novel.

### Summary
This paper proposes algorithms for one-point and two-point zero-order gradient estimators for federated learning, which relies on querying function values. This is in contrast to first-order and second-order methods for federated learning. The paper claims to be the first method that involves the effects of the wireless channel without explicitly requiring the knowledge of the channel state coefficients. Finally, the paper provides theoretical and experimental evidence for convergence and provides an upper bound on the convergence rate for both their one-point and two-point estimators.

### Strengths
To my knowledge, the application of zero-order one-point and two-point estimates without explicitly estimating the channel state coefficients is novel in federated learning.

The algorithm and theoretical contributions are not trivial and warrant more experimentation to determine the relative performance among other competing methods which also claims to save communication resources.

### Weaknesses
The experiment set-up is questionable in comparison to existing work, especially when compared to the experiments done in the baseline FedAvg federated learning algorithm. It is not clear why the authors decided to pick only two digits “0” and “1” from the MNIST dataset and only “shirts” and “sneakers” from the FashionMNIST dataset. On the other hand, the experiments done in the original FedAvg paper were done on the full multi-class datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. 

The results were also only compared to FedAvg, with no comparison done against the competing methods (which also use less communication resources) cited in section 1.1.

The inconsistency in the 2 examples in Section 4 (Experimental Results) makes the discussion unconvincing without a supporting explanation or ablation study. For the first example, a logistic regression model is used, and the images were preprocessed using a lossy autoencoder, and was based on 2 class-labels from MNIST. The second example uses a different model, without compression and on a different dataset. The results would have been more convincing if the set-ups on the 2 dataset were similar. As it stands, I am unsure if the differences between the 2 examples, as illustrated by Figure 2 and 3, are due to the different dataset or the difference in compression or the different type of model used.

The experiment results and short discussion left much to be desired. It is not clear what the conclusions are from Figure 2 and Figure 3. Are the number of communications rounds the bottleneck or the number of scalar values the bottleneck? It would be better to provide a clearer discussion of the main advantage of the methods proposed in the paper.

### Questions
1. Why were the experiment set-ups reduced form (only binary labels) of the MNIST and FashionMNIST? Are the results for ZOFL methods limited to experiments for binary classification tasks?

1. Could the evaluation for the 2 examples (Figure 2 and Figure 3) use a similar model and preprocessing? This would help isolate the reason for the difference in performances. For instance, 2P-ZOFL in Figure 2 shows a much faster rate of convergence initially, when compared to FedAvg, but this is not the case for Figure 3. It is not clear if this means that 2P-ZOFL only converges faster in terms of communication rounds only when logistic regression is used and not when multilayer-perceptron is used.

1. For clarity, can the authors provide the main metric of consideration? Are the number of scalar values more critical than the number of communication rounds in the context of the federated learning example? Perhaps it would be clearer if results on the time taken and capacity of the wireless link is provided.

1. In Section 1.1, under communication bottleneck, several competing methods that save communication resources were cited. How do these methods compare to 1P-ZOFL and 2P-ZOFL?

1. It seems that the proofs hold for a general class of perturbation vectors as stated in Assumption 2, beyond vectors that only consists of 2 unique values for every dimension of the vector (in Appendix E.2), which is interesting. Are there experimental results for these vectors?

1. The results were also only compared to FedAvg, with no comparison done against the competing methods (which also use less communication resources) cited in section 1.1.

### Summary
This paper considers Federated Learning over wireless channels and proposes a zero-order FL method with one-point and two-point gradient estimators. Only scalar-valued feedback from the devices to the server is considered and the effect of the wireless channel is incorporated in the learning algorithm. Theoretical results in terms of convergence guarantees are provided with some experimental evidence.

### Strengths
The main strengths of the paper are the following:

1) The paper considers some realistic bottlenecks of implementing FL algorithms over wireless channels, e.g., IoT applications and introduces some new ideas in zero order optimization that do not require calculation of gradients at the devices.

2) With the assumptions made in the paper, the convergence analysis for the proposed 1P and 2P ZOFL algorithms seems concrete.

### Weaknesses
The paper has the following weaknesses:

1) The wireless channel model assumed in this work is highly simplistic. Eq. (1) refers to a "flat fading" channel which completely ignores the effect of multipath and inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by it, which requires more sophisticated processing at the receiver to mitigate its effect. One cannot simply assume a simple channel model that is unrealistic in order to admit tractable analysis of FL algorithms. Furthermore, in the case of IoT devices for which FL methods are applicable, the channel conditions can vary a lot from more stationary in time to highly time-varying. 

2) In the 1P-ZOFL algorithm, how does the device know the value of $\sigma_h^2$ to be able to send $1/\sigma_h^2$ to the server? This assumes that the device has knowledge of the wireless channel for the link from itself to the server, which in practical scenarios is only possible if the base station has transmitted pilot/reference signals to the device in prior communication rounds. However, the paper does not specify this at all. Also, the terms $h_{i,k}^{DL}$ are not defined when they first appear.

2) Secondly, most IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, sensors, etc.) as well as the server (which is likely co-located at the cellular base station) have multiple antennas (i.e., MIMO technology) which make estimating the wireless channel not equivalent to estimating a single real-valued scalar value. This may render some or all of the derivations regarding the convergence analysis to be inapplicable.

3) The experimental evaluation is insufficient. It needs evaluations beyond binary image classification. Also, evaluation on more realistic channel models, e.g., those specified by 3GPP such as CDL or TDL models would be helpful to observe the degradation in the proposed algorithms when the assumptions on the channel do not hold.

1) Please refrain from using abbreviations such as "it's", "there's", etc.
