## Abstract
We investigate the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem where an action is to select $k$ arms from a set of base arms, and its reward is the maximum of the sample values of these $k$ arms, under a weak feedback structure that only returns the value and index of the arm with the maximum value. This novel feedback structure is much weaker than the semi-bandit feedback previously studied and is only slightly stronger than the full-bandit feedback, and thus it presents a new challenge for the online learning task. We propose an algorithm and derive a regret bound for instances where arm outcomes follow distributions with finite supports. Our algorithm introduces a novel concept of biased arm replacement to address the weak feedback challenge, and it achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of $O((k/\Delta)\log(T))$ and a distribution-independent regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, where $\Delta$ is the reward gap and $T$ is the time horizon. 
Notably, our regret bound is comparable to the bounds obtained under the more informative semi-bandit feedback. 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through experimental results.

### Summary
The paper focuses on solving a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem that incorporates both maximum value and index feedback, a structure that falls between semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback scenarios. The authors introduce an algorithm and establish regret bounds for the case where arm outcomes are subject to arbitrary distributions with finite supports. They examine a broader range of arms and employ a smoothness condition to analyze regret. The algorithm achieves regret bounds that depend on the specific distribution as well as bounds that are distribution-independent, and these results are similar to those found in more informative semi-bandit feedback situations. Experimental evidence validates the algorithm's effectiveness.

### Strengths
The paper presents an innovative feedback structure called "max value-index feedback," positioning it between the well-explored semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback frameworks. This introduces a fresh approach to understanding combinatorial bandit problems. The authors establish regret bounds for their algorithm, encompassing situations that rely on distribution-specific and distribution-agnostic characteristics. These bounds are demonstrated to be on par with those obtained in more informative semi-bandit feedback settings. In the paper, algorithms are introduced for both binary and arbitrary discrete distributions of arm outcomes, incorporating the max value-index feedback, and they exhibit effective performance.

### Weaknesses
The known ordering case is a simple extension of the cascading bandit.This should be more emphasis that this is not a contribution but rather a simple first case for better understanding of the new and non-trivial unknown ordering case.

Although the paper presents the application scenarios that motivate it, it is necessary to explore in more detail how the proposed approach could be applied to a wider range of problems. The paper focuses on one specific problem, the k-MAX bandit problem with maximum value index return, and I'm not convinced that this is a fundamental step towards dealing with the full-bandit CMAB problem.

The paper is specifically centered on addressing a particular combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem that incorporates maximum value and index feedback. However, it does not delve into exploring how this approach might be applied to different types of bandit problems or alternative feedback structures. The paper does not thoroughly clarify the algorithm's limitations when dealing with diverse problem settings.

The paper assumes that arm outcomes follow arbitrary distributions with finite supports, allowing for a broad treatment of the problem. Nevertheless, it may not accurately capture the characteristics of real-world scenarios. The implications of these assumptions on the algorithm's performance and regret bounds are not exhaustively examined.

While the paper does provide experimental results that showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, these experiments are conducted on a limited scale and lack extensive benchmarking against other algorithms. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's performance, a more thorough evaluation on a wider range of problem instances and a comparison with existing approaches would be beneficial.

### Questions

### Summary
This paper considers combinatorial bandits with maximum value and index feedback. The new feedback model lies somewhere in between semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback models. The new feedback model has applications in recommender systems. Assuming that the maximum value is unique, if we know the maximum value and the index of the base arm that achieves the maximum value, then we also know that all base arms selected in that particular round have reward realizations less than or equal to the maximum reward. The authors analyze the gap-dependent and gap-free regrets under base arms with finite support. They show that under these assumptions, the dependence of the regret on the batch size k and time matches with that of semi-bandit feedback algorithms.

### Strengths
This paper considers an important CMAB problem with real-world applications. There exists a wide spectrum of feedback models that lie between semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback models. Max-value feedback with an index is one of them that is mainly encountered in recommender systems. Although it seems to provide just a little more information than the full-bandit feedback setting, i.e., the index of the arm that achieves the max reward, correct utilization of this additional information results in performance almost matching with the semi-bandit feedback model. 

The paper nicely develops the theory for the new setting by starting from the Bernoulli reward case with known support values. It starts building the algorithms by borrowing tools from the CMAB-T framework. In particular, extension to arbitrary distributions with finite supports by using the representation of the outcome of a single arm with finite support as multiple binary variables and using an appropriate action selection oracle is interesting. This equivalence allows the use of the techniques formed for Bernoulli rewards in addressing the more general and challenging case.

### Weaknesses
The most practically relevant setting for the proposed work seems to be the case with arbitrary distributions of arm outcomes with finite supports. Technical development in the paper starts from the simpler cases and gives the reader an expectation that the special cases are solved to provide intuition for the general case. Algorithm 4.1 looks like the pinnacle of the paper. However, is there any result (theoretical or experimental) related to this algorithm? If the regret bound in Theorem 3.4 still holds, putting proof of this would be nice. Moreover, simulations are concerned with the Bernoulli case. Verifying the performance of Algorithm 4.1 in simulations would be nice. 

Another weakness is related to the deterministic tie-breaking rule, which is proposed as a way to accommodate non-unique arm reward values. I wonder if there is an application in which this tie-breaking is in the control of the decision-maker instead of its environment. More about this is asked in the questions part of the review. 

Other weaknesses are mostly related to presentation issues and pinpointing the difference between the estimators used compared to the ones in the semi-bandit feedback CMAB-T setting. Please see the questions section.

### Questions
Based on my initial reading, there are several unclear parts in the paper. I will be able to provide a better assessment of the quality of the paper after the authors' feedback. Answers to the following questions are crucial for my reassessment. 

- Section 3 rests on the assumption that for any action $S_t$, there is a unique arm achieving the maximum value among all arms in $S_t$. Then, it is argued that this can be extended to the non-unique values using a deterministic tie-breaking rule. My question is about implementation issues regarding this deterministic tie-breaking rule in a recommender system. A user who likes two of the shown movies out of k can randomly decide to watch one of them. Imposing a deterministic tie-breaking rule puts a restriction on the behavior of the user. I wonder if this tie-breaking rule can be justified in practice, specifically for applications in recommender systems, for instance, in the one that I mentioned above. 

- How is $q^{\mu,S}_i$ related to $q^{p,S}_i$ and $\tilde{q}^{p,S}_i$? 

- As a starting point, the authors extend the CUCB algorithm to accommodate for max value and index feedback for the case with Bernoulli rewards and known ordering of values. The claim is that most of the parts of the regret analysis of CUCB for CMAB-T remain valid under the new setting. Is it the case that in max-value max-index feedback, the estimates of base arm outcomes $p_i$ are still unbiased? This seems crucial for event E2 from the previous work Wang & Chen 2017 to apply, which achieves unbiasedness thanks to semi-bandit feedback. 

- Please comment on the batch-size dependence of the distribution-free regret bound derived from B.1. Is it the same as cascading bandits upper bound? 

- What about batch size independent regret bounds as in Liu et al. 2022, NeurIPS? Is it possible to obtain them under your current assumptions? Does triggering probability and variance modulated smoothness (TPVM) condition hold for your reward function? If so, what is the most general case in your paper so that this assumption holds? If this condition holds, then providing TPVM-based regret bounds will be good.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of combinatorial bandits with maximum value reward function with a intermediate feedback between semi-bandit and full-bandit. In particular, the learner chooses a subset $S_t \\subseteq [K]$ of $|S_t|=k$ arms as the action at each round $t$ and incurs the maximum realized reward $\\max_{i\\in S_t} X_t(i)$ among those arms, where $X_t(1),\\dots,X_t(K)$ are the i.i.d. stochastic rewards of the $K$ arms at round $t$. The learner then observes the incurred reward together with the identity $I_t \\in \\arg\\max_{i\\in S_t} X_t(i)$ of any arm achieving such a reward within the action. The authors consider discrete distributions with finite support (always including $0$) for the rewards and propose an algorithm achieving a regret bound for binary distributions that is comparable to previously-known bounds under more informative semi-bandit feedback. The results are first presented for the case of binary distributions with known ordering of arms with respect to the nonzero value in the support, and then generalized by first relaxing the assumption of a-priori known ordering. The paper also discusses extensions to discrete distributions with finite supports and presents numerical results that validate their theoretical findings.

### Strengths
- The paper considers a feedback structure for combinatorial bandits with maximum reward function that lies in between commonly studied semi-bandit and full-bandit feedback structures in combinatorial multiarmed bandit problems, recovering similar guarantees as the more informative semi-bandit setting for binary distributions.
- The authors present regret bounds for problem instances with stochastic arm outcomes according to binary distributions that always have $0$ in their support. The authors also argue how their techniques could generalize to the case of discrete distributions with finite support.
- The experimental results show that their proposed algorithm indeed achieves similar performance as an algorithm with semi-bandit feedback in this specific setting.
- The problem of combinatorial multiarmed bandits with maximum reward function can be relevant to many real-world scenarios.

### Weaknesses
- The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the proposed algorithm and its intuition. There is also no explicit definition of regret $R(T)$, which is a fundamental concept in the entirety of this work, especially for readers that might be unfamiliar with the combinatorial bandits literature. Its definition is only left implicit in how results are presented and proved, but the presentation could benefit from a formal definition in the problem formulation section. Only the "event-filtered regret" is defined, but its definition is deferred to the appendix. Finally, the authors keep referring to $R(T)$ as the regret, while its actually a more relaxed version known as $\\alpha$-regret (could be mentioned at least once in the problem setting).
- The paper focuses on binary distributions of arm outcomes always including $0$ in their support, which may not be representative of many real-world scenarios. The paper could benefit from exploring more general distributions of arm outcomes. Even if the authors argue about adapting to more general discrete distributions with finite support, these are also quite limited in the applications of their techniques. Furthermore, no theoretical guarantee is provided for there latter distributions, and the proposed reduction is expected to introduce a linear dependence in the support sizes to the regret. This is therefore unfeasible and undesirable for distributions with large enough supports, let alone countably infinite (or even continuous) supports as per many common distributions.
- The baseline methods used in the numerical results are never explicitly described or properly referenced. It is therefore unclear how meaningful the experimental results are without understanding what assumptions are made in the other algorithms used in the comparison.
- In line 7 of Algorithm 3.1 it says the learner is able to observe value $v_{i^*}$ of $i^*$ while it might happen that no value is observed if all arms in $S_t$ for a certain round $t$ have realized value equal to $0$.
- Some of the main ideas adopted in this paper, while adjusted to fit a setting with simpler distributions but less informative feedback, seem to be taken directly from Chen et al. (2016a) without striking changes.

### Questions
- Is the presence of $0$ in the support strictly necessary? Or do you believe it is possible to lift this assumption? If so, could you hint at the intuition for doing so?
- Please, see weaknesses and further elaborate on those points.

### Summary
The authors consider MAB problems where the action set is combinatorial (subsets with cardinality k) and the reward function is the max reward over the base arms.  Base arms are discrete valued and the authors consider both known and unknown support.  The authors propose a variant of semi-bandit feedback where the agent (only) learns which base arm had the largest value.   The authors then adapt the CUCB algorithm for this setting and obtain problem independent regret bound dependence of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

### Strengths
### Strengths

- Novelty – There is some novelty in the problem, method, and analysis.  K-max has been studied under semi-bandit feedback (all base arm values revealed; Chen et al. (2016)) and for special cases (Bernoulli arms) studied under bandit feedback (see note about (Agarwal et al. (2021)) below).  The proposed max-index feedback considered shares some similarity with other feedback models (cascading, triggering, dueling, etc) but I am not aware of this specific feedback model being studied previously.  The algorithm and analysis largely (though not trivially) follow that for the CUCB for probabilistically triggered arms -- the realization and index of the maximizing base arm are modeled as two arms that are triggered.  
- Significance – I think with stronger motivation for the problem set up considered this would be of some interest to the CMAB community.  
- Quality – I did not go through the proofs, but from my reading the work appears sound.

### Weaknesses

### Related work
- There’s an uncited work that is relevant -- https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16812 “DART” by the same authors of (Agarwal et al. (2021)), for picking K sized subsets with a non-linear rewards.  The former does not have the same FSD assumption as the cited work and in terms of horizon $T$ dependence they get $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ problem independent upper regret bounds and lower bounds.  They show that K-max for independent Bernoulli arms satisfies the assumptions in that paper.  



### Writing & Clarity 
There are a few (addressable) issues with the writing that affect readability.  

- Is the regret $R(T)$ formally defined?  I didn’t see it in the problem formulation or anywhere before it is upper bounded in Theorem 3.4.  In addition to being unambiguous about cumulative vs instantaneous, regret vs pseudo-regret, you mentioned approximation algorithms for the general offline problem and so it becomes ambiguous if you are working with regret or an $\alpha$-regret (and if so specifically a $\alpha=1-1/e$ regret or an $\alpha=1-\varepsilon$ regret).  

- Relatedly, page 5 is the first place “approximation oracle” is mentioned once in the text before the Alg 3.1 pseudocode but what “approximation oracle” refers to is not formally described.  That should be formally discussed in the problem setup or at least before pseudocode for the algorithm that calls it.  Also, for completeness the procedures that are proposed to be used for an oracle should be formally described (appendix would be fine).


- Algorithms – 
    - (minor) I found the discussion in the text confusing about maintaining confidence bounds on not only $p_i$’s but also $v_i$’s, which are deterministic.  Looking in the pseudocode for the $v_i$’s there aren’t any confidence bounds – instead the values are set optimistically to $1$ and (since the support is deterministic) updated exactly once on the first time that arm is the maximizer (if that occurs).  Calling it a confidence bound is confusing in my opinion.
    - (Minor) – In Section 3.2 I would suggest linking to the pseudocode earlier, such as at end of second paragraph “Due to limited space, the pseudocode is presented in Algorithm B.1.”  

- I think it would be valuable to have a fuller discussion of the hardness for the offline setting and corresponding approximation methods (Bernoulli (which seems easy based on (Agarwal et al. (2021))’s DART results), non-Bernoulli binary (you mention can be solved exactly with dynamic programming, but are hardness results known for the non-Bernoulli binary case?), and general (you cite Chen et al. (2016a).) to give the reader a fuller intuition.  E.g. explicitly state that the general offline problem (and non-Bernoulli binary offline problem too) is NP-hard; don’t just state that greedy methods can get an $\alpha$ approximation.


### Experiments
- Semi-bandit CUCB is good to include; it would be good to also include Agarwal et al. (2021))’s DART since that has  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ guarantees under bandit feedback when the arms are Bernoulli.  It would probably do worse since its assumptions might not hold for non-Bernoulli arms, but it might be more competitive than UCB.
- The distributions in the experiments are all binary?  That should be mentioned in the main text.  
- “three different arm distributions representing different scenarios” is quite generic and suggests potentially distinct problems (such as modeling three different applications), but the ‘different scenarios’ are almost identical manually constructed examples with a single arm changed from scenarios 1 to 2 and then from 2 to 3.  That is ok to do but the description in Section 5 should be revised to reflect both of those issues (manually designed and single arm changes from one scenario to another).

### Questions
1. Motivation – What would be a motivating application of K-max with the max-index feedback for which the arm supports would be unknown? Elaborate more on how one or multiple applications motivate the problem set up you consider.  The ‘concrete’ scenario mentioned in the introduction of recommender systems “The goal is to display a subset of k product items to a user that best fit the user preference. The feedback can be limited, as we may only observe on which displayed product item the user clicked and their subsequent rating of this product.”  For most systems I can think of, the numerical feedback would be on a known, fixed scale (like 1-5 stars, or on a 1-10 scale) meaning the support is identical for all arms and known a priori.



### Minor 
2. In the contributions, “Our work may be seen as a step towards solving full-bandit CMAB problems with non-linear reward functions under mild assumptions.”  Can you elaborate on that (if that's kept in the main contributions)?  The feedback model and modifications to CUCB to appear specialized for the max reward function and thus the work does not seem extendable to other non-linear rewards.
