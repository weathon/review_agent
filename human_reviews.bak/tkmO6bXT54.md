# Mining latent labels for imbalance classification: a regrouping perspective

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Deep learning-based models are sensitive to class imbalance. Existing approaches often involve rebalancing tricks such as loss reweighting and class resampling to emphasize the minority class. In this work, we explore a novel baseline method to deal with class imbalance by regrouping the majority class into smaller pseudo-classes and turning the imbalanced classification problem into a balanced multiclass classification. This simple modification helps to make the class frequencies more uniform in the training data and, simultaneously, helps the representation learning by imposing a structure on the majority class. Experiment results on binary and multiclass classification show that the proposed method can substantially boost the classification performance as measured by average precision metric. Our code will be released before publication.

### Summary
To handle imbalanced data, the authors propose RG (Regrouping) by
clustering instances in the majority class, create pseudo-classes
from the classes, and learned a classifier with more classes.  If the
score for the minority class is larger than the pseudo-class, the
minority class is predicted; otherwise, the majority class is
predicted.  For multi-class data, all classes except the smallest
class are regrouped.  The proposed approach is quite straightforward.

For binary classification, RG was evaluated on two datasets.  For
multi-class classification, RG was evaluated on one dataset.

### Strengths
The problem of imbalanced data in multi-class classification is
interesting.  RG outperforms existing techniques in balanced accuracy
(BA) in one dataset.

### Weaknesses
The efficacy of RG is not well demonstrated.  In Table 1, RG only
outperforms in one of 3 metrics in one of 2 datasets.  For the
multi-class problem only one dataset is used.

The choice of datasets could be improved.  The 9 classes in CIFAR 10
are quite different and merging to simulate a single majority class
might have a quite diversified class.  For example, a majority class
has many images of dogs, but the different kinds (subclasses/clusters)
of dogs have commonalities to be dogs.  Hence, Binary CIFAR 10 might
not be a good dataset to use.  Binary HAM10000 on "dermatoscopic
images of 7 common skin lesions" is more appropriate.

The presentation could be improved.  For example:

Sec 2.2: Sum aggregation was discussed, but it seems to be not used
in any experiments.  Also, the motivation for Sum aggregation was not
discussed.

Sec. 2.2 does not discuss how clusters are formed via regrouping.
k-means is mentioned in 4.1 Setting of experiment.

### Questions
RG+WCE: since RG tries to balanced class sizes, why do you need WCE
(weighted cross entropy)?  Why did WCE help?  Could you describe WCE
or cite a source?

p7.  "Considering that AUPRC is agnostic to the decision rule and is
often approximated by AP given finite sample sizes"--any citations or
evidence to support the statement?

### Summary
This paper proposes a regrouping method to improve the performance of imbalanced learning, which decomposes the majority classes into subclasses by clustering and trains the model under the extended classes. The authors analyzed the ability of the proposed RG , demonstrating its ability to facilitate learning efficient representation and synchronizing the training progress across different classes, and verified the performance thorough a range of experiments.

### Strengths
1) ReGrouping method is different from the conventional loss reweighting or re-sampling methods that changes the class importance explicitly. By regrouping, the learning pace of each class (especially for rare classes) can be directly intervened as shown in the loss variation illustration in Figure 5. 

2) The authors provided some interesting validations to support the design about the proposed method like the synchronous learning, and presented how to design the clustering number and extend to multi-class learning as well as the underlying tricky points for the optimal performance. 

3) The authors conducted a range of experiments on both binary and multi-class imbalanced learning tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of balanced accuracy (BA) and average precision (AP) metrics.

### Weaknesses
Although the methods shows the interesting points of the proposed regrouping method, some critical concerns remained and are summarized as follows.

1) The novelty concern can be a big problem. As the authors mentioned about the COG method (local clustering for imbalanced learning in Wu, et. al., 2010), both the proposed method and COG shares the same spirit for imbalanced learning, and the technical major difference is COG follows the SVM classifier. Despite in different data context, they are both for imbalanced learning, which weakens the novelty of this work.

2) The technical description is not sufficient, as we can see that there is lack of the clustering ways for pseudo labels that are used in the regrouping method. This also connects the lack of the corresponding experiments to verify the clustering impact on the final performance. Especially, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, how to assign the pseudo labels does matter about the performance, which makes the readers care about the clustering effectiveness.

3) The experiments are also not very persuasive although some experiments have shown the improvement about RG. The major concern is about the datasets and the baselines especially for the multi-class classification experiments. There are a range of explorations in long-tailed learning for multi-class classification problems. However, we cannot find any sufficient comparison with the recent advances like Decoupling, LA (logit adjustment), BCL and so on. For the datasets in long-tailed learning, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT or INaturalist are all widely adopted benchmarks, which should be included in this submission.

### Questions
Overall, I am interested in this regrouping idea for imbalance learning, although it has been proposed in previous explorations. What is the intrinsic difference for imbalanced learning should be highlighted, instead of some minor difference as in the description of the submission. For other questions, please see above weakness.

### Summary
This paper proposes a simple solution for class imbalanced problem by grouping the majority class to smaller sub-classes. The paper is well-written and easy to read.

### Strengths
Showcasing how multi-class classification by regrouping the majority class to smaller sub-classes work better than a binary classification.

### Weaknesses
- In the experiments there are no error bars. 
- There is no experiment that any model that is not data hungry has been applied to compare it with DNN.

### Questions
- I would like to see the experiments results with error bars included. For example if you run the experiment n times and calculate standard deviation.
- I would also like to see how the results change if you apply non-hungry methods such as Gaussian processes.
- Sometimes groping the classes to small sub-groups is a difficult task by itself, how do you decide what type of data you can use to have this meaningful sub-groups? What happens if you can't put them into smaller groups?
- What are the limitations of your method?
