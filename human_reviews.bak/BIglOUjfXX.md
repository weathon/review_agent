# Forked Diffusion for Conditional Graph Generation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
We introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework that incorporates forking for conditional generation. In this framework, a single  parent diffusion process is associated with a primary variable (e.g., structure), while multiple child diffusion processes are employed, each dedicated to a dependent variable (e.g., property). The parent process guides the co-evolution of its child processes towards segregated representation spaces. This approach allows our models to manage conditional information flow effectively, uncover intricate interactions and dependencies, and ultimately unlock new generative capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over contemporary baselines in the context of conditional graph generation, highlighting the potential of forking diffusion for enhancing conditional generation tasks and inverse molecular design tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposes the forked diffusion process, featuring one parent process on graph structures and children processes for distinct properties. The method is assessed using the QM9 and ZINC250K datasets in comparison to baselines. While the concept sounds interesting, the current study does not support the authors' conclusion (quoted below) on the last page.

> Specifically, FDP demonstrates exceptional capabilities in the domains of conditional graph generation for molecular structures, inverse
molecule design tasks, and the generation of generic graphs, surpassing contemporary diffusionbased methods.

### Strengths
1. The idea of incorporating forking into the diffusion process sounds reasonable.

2. The algorithm presented on page 6 is concise and aids in understanding the method.

### Weaknesses
W1: The paper lacks specific details on how the diffusion processes operate on graph structures and node features. Figure 1 illustrates the 3-D molecular structure; however, it remains unclear how, or if, these 3-D positions are integrated into the study.

W2: Some claims regarding contributions appear overstated. Recent research [1,2] indicates that achieving high levels of novelty, uniqueness, and validity on QM9 and ZINC250K is not particularly challenging; for instance, merely adding carbons can suffice. It's evident from recent studies [1,2] that both the genetic algorithm [3] and the reinvent method [5] serve as potent baselines. This paper should benchmark against a broader set of baselines to truly showcase its performance in molecular design tasks. Furthermore, molecular properties such as plogp and qed are often deemed impractical [1] and not truly beneficial for real-world inverse molecule design tasks.

W3: In GDSS, node features and graph structures are treated as separate diffusion processes. The connection between this approach and the proposed method requires deeper exploration.

W4: The assumption that "the properties are independent conditioned on the structure" in Equation 15 is unjustified and not reliable.

Other minor points:

W5: The pictures should be of higher resolution.

W6: There are several typos, such as the "}" symbol, in Figure 1.

W7: Definitions of the variables should be clarified. For instance, the dimension of the variable y is not clearly stated.

### Summary
This work presents conditional diffusion framework for graph generation by proposing forked diffusion processes, that models the graph diffusion process as a single parent process over a primary variable (i.e., structure) and multiple child processes over dependent variables, further including additional context. This work provide experimental results on diverse graph generation tasks showing improved generation performance over continuous graph diffusion model GDSS and other generative models.

### Strengths
- This work propose new graph diffusion framework by modeling a system of joint diffusion processes with explicit dependency conditions, e.g., dependency of child variables on parent variable, and additional context. 

- The experimental results on diverse tasks demonstrate that FDP improves generation performance over other graph diffusion models, especially GDSS.

### Weaknesses
- Explanation on key components lacks details:
  1. What do the structure variable ($x_s$) and child variables ($x_p$) actually represent during the experiments?
  2. What does the models ($s_{\\phi_i, t}$) approximate?
  3. How is the training objective derived? Is it a straightforward extension of score matching objective?

- Several claims made in the paper are not clear and requires justification:
  1. ( as explained in Intro) How does the parent process guide the childe processes? From what I have understood, the paraent process and child processes are dependent to each other rather than specific process guiding others, similar to the processes of GDSS. In particular, the proposed diffusion framework seems to be a system of multiple processes (parent and childs) with some dependency conditions given betwen the variables, and the score functions are dependent to all the variables including additional context.
  2. Is the assumption on independence between child variables valid for the experiments? As what I have understood, the child variables represent some chemical properties, for which do not seem to be independent to each other.
  3. (at the end of Sec. 3.4 and Tab. 1) What does the energy guidance mechanism indicate? Why is the additional influence of $s_{\\phi_i}$ characterized as an energy guidance?

- As FDP requires multiple score models (for the primary and child variables), I presume the number of model parameters required  for FDP would be quire large. Ablation study on number of model parameters could strengthen the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- Important experimental details, for example, model architecture or what the variables actually represents, are not provided in the main paper. There seems to be some explanation in Appendix B, but not referenced by the main paper.

- The reason for superior performance on unconditional molecule generation (Sec. 4.4) is not clear. Especially, an important baseline, GDSS, seems to be missing in Tab. 6.

- Missed some previous works on conditional graph generation:

  - Lee et al., Exploring Chemical Space with Score-based Out-of-distribution Generation, ICML 2023

### Questions
- Please address the questions in the Weakeness section.

- Is the Wiener processes ($\\mathrm{d}\\textbf{w}$) in Eq. (2) independent?

- Recent works (e.g., DiGress) find that using Graph Transformer architecture (instead of GNN-based architecture of GDSS) shows improved generation performance. Does FDP show similar improvement over GDSS when using the Transfomer architecture?

### Summary
This paper proposes a forked diffusion model for conditional graph generation that introduces parent process and child processes to learn and generate graphs with desired properties. The contributions of this paper include introducing forking as a new technique for conditional generation, providing a rigorous mathematical framework using SDE, and demonstrating the versatility of the proposed forked diffusion with empirical evidence.

### Strengths
1.	The forked diffusion framework for graph generation is novel.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation behind the proposal of forked diffusion is not clear in the introduction. While the categories of related work are presented, it is unclear what deficiencies these methods have compared to the proposed approach.
2. The related work is not comprehensive enough, as recent diffusion-based methods such as Digress [1], etc., have not been mentioned.
3. Given the computational demands of the diffusion model, I believe that the application of the forked diffusion model to large-scale datasets may be even more challenging. The authors should compare the proposed model's training and generation efficiency with related work on large-scale datasets such as Guacamol.
4. In the conditional generation experiments, experiments on large-scale datasets and additional baselines for comparison should be included. Especially for the task of molecular generation, it would be beneficial for the authors to include recent methods such as DiGress [1], MiCaM [2], MolHF [3], etc.

### Summary
This paper works on conditional graph generation via score-based generative model. Instead of directly input conditional properties as context to model inside generation, the paper proposes to use a separate variable to model each conditional property and jointly model them inside the score-based diffusion framework. The author tested it over many real-world datasets, including molecular datasets and generic graphs. The proposed method shows better performance to naive conditional diffusion models.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is easy-to-follow, and the written is clear.
2. While being a simple extension via introducing additional variables for conditional properties inside diffusion process, the method shows better performance comparing to use these properties as context input directly. 
3. The author did a relatively comprehensive evaluation on many datasets and properties.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is kind of a simple extension to current SDE diffusion models. There is not much technique improvement except introducing additional variables for these conditional properties inside the SDE process. 
2. Most importantly, as the author just directly introducing these additional variables (with a simple conditional independent assumption among properties given the graph), the properties are not aligned with the intermediate graphs during the SDE process. This makes the method not very reasonable. For example, as there is no direct correspondance between graphs and properties, it is possible that the generated properties are not aligning with the generated graph. The alignment between property and graph at individual level is very important, all experiments don't have evaluation on this individual alignment. Only population-level MAE for these properties are evaluated. 
3. In the experiment of generic graph generation, I don't see a clear difference of the population-level MAE between the proposed method and naive baseline GDSS, which may indicates that the method is not very effective. 
4. Table 6 shows the result over unconditional generation, although this is not the intention of the designed method, I'm curious why the baseline only include GDSS-seq instead of the original GDSS. 
5. Figure 3, ego-small should be the right one?

### Questions
1. Can you summarize what you want to prove inside Appendix A.2? I'm kind of confused as I believe the reverse SDE formulation is a well-known result that is directly used.
