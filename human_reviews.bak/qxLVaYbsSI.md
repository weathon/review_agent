## Abstract
Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaboratively training machine learning models using distributed data with label deficiency. Advanced FSSL methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called **Twinsight**, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, Twinsight concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, Twinsight introduces a neighborhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighborhood relationship among data features extracted by both models. Our comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets provide substantial evidence that Twinsight can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods across various experimental settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed Twinsight.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper points out that the objective functions used in federated semi-supervised learning cause gradient conflict, which is attributed to the decentralized nature of federated learning. To tackle gradient conflict, it proposes a dual-model framework, Twinsight, to tackle label deficiency in federated learning. Twinsight trains a supervised paired with an unsupervised model. Meanwhile, Twinsight introduces a constraint to enable the interaction between the supervised and unsupervised models to preserve the neighborhood relation.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of this paper is meaningful, as it raises the gradient conflict problem.

2. The proposed solution is reasonable, and preserving the proximity relationships between samples is indeed a valid approach to address this issue.

3. This paper is well-written and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
1. The algorithm requires training an additional model, leading to increased computation and communication costs. 

2. There are details missing in the method and experimental description, raising concerns about reproducibility. Regarding Equation (9), the authors did not explicitly specify the choices of the metric d and the function N in both the method and the experiments section.

3. The datasets are basic, and it appears that each experiment was run only once, with the random seed not being disclosed.

### Questions
What's the specific selection of d and N in the experiments?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a novel twin-model paradigm for the federated learning in the label deficiency scenario, aimed to enhance the federated model effect by interacting insights of supervised and unsupervised models on labeled and unlabeled data. This paper points out that different objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data could lead to gradient conflict of federated learning. The author introduces supervised and unsupervised models in each client, and uses constraints to preserve the neighborhood relationship between the two models to interact their information, and finally realizes robust and effective federated semi-supervised learning. In addition, this paper conducts comparative experiments and ablation experiments on several benchmark datasets to prove the superiority and stability of the proposed algorithm compared with other baselines.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes to train both supervised and unsupervised models on the client side to avoid gradient conflict caused by different objective functions when aggregating models on the server.
2. This paper introduces a neighborhood-preserving constraint to enable the supervised model and unsupervised model to fully interact with effective insights, collaborate and mutually benefit from each other’s strengths.
3.This paper conducts comprehensive comparison experiments and ablation experiments to prove the advanced performance of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper combines existing techniques to solve the federal semi-supervision problem, but lacks the necessary references and explanations. For example, the unsupervised algorithm adopted in formula (6) is not explained. f(w_u;∙) as an unsupervised model, what are its specific working principles and objectives? What does sim(∙) mean? What kind of neighborhood relation construction function is N(∙) of formula (9), and how does it construct neighborhood relation?
2. The experimental results of this paper lack the necessary convincing. It is mentioned in the experimental setup that the paper will report the results after 500 rounds of training of the global model. What is the meaning of Round in Tables 1 and 2? If Round represents the number of training rounds, then why is the Round of each comparison method different and none reaches 500, which may cause the baseline results not being comparable.

### Questions
1. The authors can introduce the content of the proposed algorithm in more detail. For the parts that refer to other methods (in formula (6) and formula (9)), the authors should indicate the citation and briefly describe how them work.
2. The authors can rereport experimental results and compare baseline performance with the same number of training rounds.
3. In the scenario of both unlabeled and labeled data, some combinations of federated algorithms and semi-supervised algorithms does not perform as well as federated learning using only labeled data, which violates normal cognition. The authors can try to explain the reasons for this phenomenon.
4. The authors can try to prove the global convergence of the proposed objective function.

### Summary
This paper considers the semi-superved federated learning setting, when there are clients with only unlabeled data. Authors recognize a gradient conflict phenomenon, and proposed a two-model solution for the setting, one to conduct supervised learning and the other one unsupervised learning. It also proposed a neighborhood position constrain to align the features learnt by two models.

### Strengths
- The paper considers a practically important problem and proposes a useful and principled solution to it.
- The paper is overal well-written and easy to follow. It is well organized and the presentation is clear.
- The idea is straightforward and well-motivated, and has a certain degree of originality and significance.
- Extended empirical study is conducted.

### Weaknesses
- The motivation needs to be further explained.
  - Since "client drift" has been observed before, how "gradient cliff" is different from it, as the first contribution is claiming the phenonmenon?
  - When exactly will "gradient cliff" happen? Does it happen all the time when training traditional FSSL methods?
  - Since "The twin-model paradigm naturally avoids the issue of gradient conflict.", it would be nice to show how gradient similarities are improved by Twin-sight.

### Questions
- It is nice to consider the partially labeled scenario, which is more realistic. The proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to a more realistic scenario where each client has a different ratio of labeled data. Are there any considerable difficulties? This is only for discussion, authors need not to append experiments.
- What is the neighbourhood function used? Does it consider some graph structure?

### Summary
The authors propose Twinsight, an approach to semi-supervised federated learning that addresses gradient conflicts that may result from training a single model on each client. The Twinsight method is to train two models, one fully supervised and one unsupervised. An additional loss term is added to each model's objective to couple them together. This term quantifies the discrepancy between neighborhood relationships under the action of each model on the input data. The method is demonstrated on four data sets and compared against several baseline methods. The Twinsight method demonstrated improved performance of the supervised model.

### Strengths
The authors explore a novel approach for leveraging unlabeled data in the federated setting and demonstrate improved model performance as a result. The range of baselines and data sets is good.

Overall the paper is well structured and well written.

### Weaknesses
What are gradient conflicts? In vanilla supervised training gradients are averaged over all data. Certainly there are some data points whose gradients differ in their direction. Is this a significant cause for concern? Has it been studied elsewhere? Naturally, the dissimilarity between gradients of different data points will reach an extreme as the loss nears a local minimum. Yet, to my knowledge, this has not concerned anyone. 

The neighborhood relation is a foundational technical element of the authors' method. Yet, it is given almost no technical treatment. How is N(.) computed? What are the consequences of different choices of quantifying the neighborhood?

Can the authors shed some insight into why their method appears so much better than the baselines? "This constraint enables ... to collaborate and mutually benefit from each other’s strengths" is not a strong explanation. Why should the proposed coupling be better than manifold regularization or other forms of semi-supervised learning?

### Questions
Can you please include the default accuracy (accuracy achieved by always predicting the majority class). This should always be included when using accuracy as an evaluation metric.
