- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a particle based approximate inference algorithm with largely well understood theoretical properties. In recent years, many variants of SVGD have been proposed and shown to share those properties. A preliminary test of the hybrid kernel variant (h-SVGD) has demonstrated promising results on image classification with deep neural network ensembles. However, the theoretical properties of h-SVGD have not yet been established, and its practical advantages have not been fully explored. In this paper, we define a hybrid kernelised Stein discrepancy (h-KSD) and prove that the h-SVGD update direction is optimal within an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We also prove a descent lemma that guarantees a decrease in the KL divergence at each step along with other limit results. Numerical results demonstrate that h-SVGD mitigates the variance collapse behaviour of SVGD at no additional computational cost whilst remaining competitive at inference tasks.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the theoretical properties of hybrid Stein variational gradient descent, which uses a different kernel for the attraction term and the repulsion term. It is shown that h-SVGD update direction is optimal in decreasing the KL divergence. An assortment of results for h-SVGD are proved, extending recent theoretical results regarding SVGD. Experiments are performed to verify that h-SVGD can mitigate the variance collapse problem in high dimensions.

### Strengths
* The writing is very clear and generally good, except it seems unmotivated at times.
* The proofs are concise (I have only checked Thm 4.1 closely) and it is more careful (e.g. Remark 3) and has better generalization (e.g. Lemma B.2 and Proposition 4.7) compared to existing results.
* While the idea of analyzing the update direction in the sum of two RKHSes is natural, it is nevertheless clean and well-explained.
* The discussion in Appendix C on why h-KSD does not have an easily computable form (compared to KSD) is an important and interesting addition to the paper.
* Experiments seem sufficient in illustrating the advantage of h-SVGD in mitigating variance collapse.

### Weaknesses
* The analysis seems like straightforward extensions of existing results, e.g., most proofs in Section 4 are 1-liners.
* While the result (Thm 4.1) on the optimality of the h-SVGD update direction and many theoretical results does not require $k_1$ to be related to $k_2$, in all experiments, $k_2$ is simply a scalar multiple of $k_1$, i.e., $k_2 = f(d)k_1$. This seems to suggest the more general theory does not give rise to diverse choices of $k_1$ and $k_2$ in applications.
* Even if we only consider the case of $k_2 = f(d)k_1$, it remains a question of how to choose the scaling function $f(d)$. The paper suggests taking $f(d) = \sqrt{d}$ or $\ln(d)$, but further comparision (either empircal or theoretical) is lacking.
* As discussed in Appendix C, h-KSD is not a valid discrepancy measure, which seems to suggest it is less useful as a metric than the vanilla KSD.

### Questions
1. Could the authors explain why $\phi_{\mu, p}^{k_1,k_2} \in \mathcal{H}_1^d\cap \mathcal{H}_2^d$ in Thm 4.1?
2. Are there any applications of choices of $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{H}_2$ does not include one another?
3. How is the bandwidth of the kernels affecting the variance collapse, compared to the choice of $f(d)$? Or to put the question in another way, how to simultaneously choose the bandwidth and $f(d)$ in applications?
4. At the beginning of Section 5, the authors mention [Zhuo et al. 2018] that puts a "conditional dependence structure". What does this mean exactly?
5. In Table 1, the test accuracy on Yacht for h-SVGD is poor compared to SVGD. Why is this the case?
6. Where is the map $\Phi_p^{k_1,k_2}$ defined in (9)?

### Summary
The paper presents a theoretical justification for using h-SVGD, a variant of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method in which different kernels are used for the gradient term and the repulsive terms. The authors show that this method can mitigate the variance collapse problem without extra computational cost while remaining competitive to standard SVGD.

### Strengths
* The background section surveys the relevant studies and concepts for this paper well.
* The theoretical results in this paper seem to be novel and may be relevant for the community. 
* The authors indeed demonstrate that the variance collapse phenomena is reduced to some extent according to the proposed metric.

### Weaknesses
* The paper focuses on h-SVGD, which is fine, but I am not convinced about the impact of this SVGD variant. The empirical results in this paper do not show a conclusive advantage for preferring this method over the standard SVGD, and the same applies to the original paper by D’Angelo et al., (2021).  
* Following the last point, although the scope of the paper is to provide a theoretical ground for h-SVGD, perhaps it will have a stronger contribution if the authors would clearly state (and evaluate) families of valid kernels for the repulsive term. 
* I find it odd that the test log-likelihood is not correlative with the dimension averaged marginal variance. If indeed the particles are more diverse with h-SVGD then I expected that it will be reflected in a better test log-likelihood.
* The method section is not written clearly enough in my opinion. Specifically, the authors can provide better intuition for some of the results. Also, perhaps the authors should present only the main claims in the main text and provide a proof sketch for them.

### Questions
* In D’Angelo et al., (2021) the authors used a different kernel for the repulsive term from the ones used in this paper. Is there something in the theory that does not apply on their kernel? It may be interesting to evaluate the performance and variance shrinkage of that kernel as well.

### Summary
This paper proposed a theoretical framework for Stein variational gradient descent with hybrid kernels in drift and repulsive terms. This paper mainly leverages the tools from the previous work to analyse the meaning of descent direction in SVGD, large time asymptotics, large particle limits and its gradient flow form. Empirically, the author conduct one synthetic and one Bayesian neural network.

### Strengths
The paper presents a theoretical framework for hybrid kernel SVGD. By leveraging the tools from previous work, the analysis is extensive. If the reader is familiar with the Stein discrepancy, the presentation is clear. Originality is not the strongest selling point of this paper, since the theoretical analysis follows from the previous work and extend the previous analysis to the hybrid kernel space, but it is still good to see the hybrid kernel trick has a proper underlying theory associated with it.

### Weaknesses
My primary concern pertains to the apparent significance of the hybrid kernel approach, as presented in the paper. The paper suggests that the hybrid kernel is proposed as a solution to circumvent the issue of variance collapsing. Nonetheless, it should be noted that there are numerous preceding studies such as S-SVGD, Grassman SVGD, among others, addressing similar challenges. Some of these methods have successfully established a proper goodness-of-fit test, ensuring that the resultant discrepancy is a valid one.
Despite this, I observed a lack of empirical evidence showcasing the hybrid kernel approach’s advantages over these established methods. In light of this, could you please elucidate on the specific benefits and improvements of the hybrid kernel approach, be it from a theoretical or empirical standpoint?

My second concern revolves around the convergence properties of the h-SVGD algorithm. The manuscript demonstrates that the descent magnitude is h-KSD, which, as acknowledged, is not a proper discrepancy. This raises questions regarding the algorithm’s capability to minimize the KL divergence effectively, specifically, whether it can drive the KL divergence to zero. A descent magnitude (h-KSD) of zero does not implies that the distributions are equal or that the KL divergence has been minimized to zero.
This brings us back to the previous point on the need for the hybrid kernel approach’s advantages. It is good to understand how h-SVGD, with its unique convergence characteristics, stands out amidst other existing methodologies addressing similar issues.

### Questions
1. For theorem 4.1, how do you ensure the $H_1 \cap H_2$ is not empty?
2. From the experiment 5.1, it seems that the variance still collapses but at a slower speed. But from the plot in S-SVGD or GSVGD paper, the variance estimation does not drop at $d=100$. So what is the advantages of the hybrid approach?

### Summary
A hybrid kernel variant of SVGD is theoretically analysed in this paper. By defining a hybrid Stein operator and, subsequently, h-KSD, they prove that (1) the h-SVGD update direction is optimal within an appropriate RKHS, (2) h-SVGD guarantees a decrease in the KL divergence at each step and (3) other limit results. Experimentally, h-SVGD also mitigates the crucial variance collapse of SVGD algorithms at no additional cost and is shown to be competitive with other SVGD methods.

### Strengths
- h-SVGD has previously been proposed heuristically by D'Angelo et al. (2021). This paper provides a theoretical analysis of h-SVGD, which is a significant contribution to the literature: both the optimal update direction and the KL divergence decrease are important theoretical results for any new SVGD algorithm.
- The large time asymptotics of h-SVGD are analysed, showing that h-SVGD always decreases the KL and converges to the true posterior in the limit. 
- Seemingly technical theoretical results are given adequate intuition and explanation, making the paper accessible to a wide audience, including applied users of SVGD algorithms.
- Most SVGD algorithms suffer from variance collapse, which is a significant issue in practice. Some results show h-SVGD is shown to mitigate this issue, which would be a significant practical contribution.

### Weaknesses
- Despite rigorous theoretical results, the experimental results are not sufficient to show that it mitigates the variance collapse issue better than previous methods (e.g. S-SVGD and G-SVGD). For (2), it would be useful to study the variance collapse issue with inference tasks in higher dimensions in comparison to previous approaches, such as the experiments in [1], as this is mainly an issue that arises in large dimensions.

### Questions
- What is the computational cost of h-SVGD compared to SVGD? Is it the same or more expensive?
