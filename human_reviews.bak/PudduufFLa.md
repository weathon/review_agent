## Abstract
Learning representations of geographical space is vital for any machine learning model that integrates geolocated data, spanning application domains such as remote sensing, ecology, or epidemiology. Recent work embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features. These embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures with which these functional embeddings are combined. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined. The model code and experiments are available at https://github.com/marccoru/locationencoder.

### Summary
A method to learn features representations of geographical data observed on the Earth's surface is presented.  The method is based on intrinsic neural fields, using spherical harmonic functions for the positional encoding, combined with SIRENs which adopt sine non-linearities as periodic activation functions (the spherical harmonic embedding can of course also be combined with other neural networks).  It is also shown that SIRENs can be see as a form of learned Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) positional embedding.  A number of experiments are presented, across synthetic and real-world problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the representation for machine learning tasks, typcially classification.  The proposed method demonstrates an improvement in performance over existing techniques.

### Strengths
The method is straightforward and flexible since it simply involves a spherical harmonic encoding coupled with a neural network (e.g. fully-connected, SIREN).  The poles on the sphere can be handled directly since the continuous spherical harmonic functions can be evalued for any coordinates, including the poles, whereas alternative approaches based on equirectangular sampling of the sphere often have large numbers of samples near the poles, which can induce artefacts.

### Weaknesses
Positional encoding for implicit neural representations on manifolds, such as the sphere, have been considered previously in Grattarola & Vandergheynst (2022), which is cited, and also in [Koestler et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07967), which is not cited but should be.  Grattarola & Vandergheynst do not specifically consider the sphere and spherical harmonics, instead focusing on graph representations, but consider an emedding based on the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian.  Koestler et al. consider general manifolds, with an embedding based on the eignenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  On the sphere, these eignerfunctions are specifically the spherical harmonics.  So an embedding based on spherical harmonics as presented in this article is not new, although in this work the embedding is combined with SIRENs and extensive experiments on the sphere are performed.

One limitation of the proposed approach is that it is limited to very low degrees L on the sphere, typically L of 20 or at most 40.  The spherical harmonics are precomputed analytically, which while fine for these very low degrees will not scale to higher degrees.

It is indeed the case that combining the spherical harmonic encoding with SIRENS typically gives the best performance (see Table 1).  However, in many cases the improvement is not that substantial, compared to the next-best method.  The improvements for the ERA 5 dataset appear to be more marked.

### Questions
- Could the authors elaborate how their work fits into the context of prior work by Grattarola & Vandergheynst (2022) and [Koestler et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07967).

- It seems combined spherical harmonic encoding with SIRENs is generally best.  However, for the ERA 5 dataset it seems a fully connected network was significantly better than combing with SIREN.  Do the authors have any idea why a fully connected network was best here?  

- Do the authors have any thoughts on how they could extend the method to higher degrees L?

### Summary
This paper proposes a location encoder which combines spherical harmonics (SH) coordinate embeddings with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) and argues that SH encodings enable accounting better for the geometry of the Earth than existing methods using Double Fourier Sphere which project coordinates to rectangular domain. 

Several positional embedding methods in combination with different neural networks to obtain location encoders are compared across 4 tasks. They claim that SH with SirenNets are an effective way of encoding geographical location, in particular for tasks where there is data in polar regions or at a global scale. 
They also find that SirenNets perform competitively on their own (without any encoding of the latitude and longitude) which they explain by showing that SirenNets can written out as DFS embeddings.

### Strengths
- The paper is clear and well-written.
- While neither SH nor SirenNets are novel, their combination appears as a well-motivated approach to location encoding, and has never been used in this context. 
- The proposed method attempts at addressing challenges around the poles, an issue which seems to have been overlooked with methods assuming a rectangular data space. 
- The results obtained on the 4 datasets suggest that the proposed combination of SH and SirenNet is an effective way of encoding location.

### Weaknesses
- While we acknowledge the work put into designing tasks to showcase challenges specific to geographic location encoding, it would have been interesting to see more comparisons on datasets that have been used by previous work on this topic, besides the iNaturalist task (e.g. the fMoW dataset used in the Sphere2Vec paper cited in this work). 
- The task on the ERA5 dataset was designed specifically for this work. It is difficult to assess whether the gain in using SH would also be significant in real-life climate science tasks, which is a domain of application that the paper puts forward. Would it be possible to integrate this method other tasks more common with ERA5 such as downscaling?

### Questions
- I am curious to hear the authors' intuition about the combination of SirenNet and some DFS based encodings performing worse than SirenNet alone? (e.g. SphereC+ + SirenNet on INaturalist 2018)
- I may have missed this information but what is the number of Legendre Polynomials in the experiments results reported in the tables? I would also be curious to have the performance of the different models of Figure 5 with the number of polynomials alongside the computational efficiency. As in, is the extra computational cost associated with using SH worth bearing with a higher number of polynomials in terms of gain in performance for L > 20? It seems that not (from looking at Fig4a) but it would be helpful to compare the performance of the different location encoding methods. 
-  I am surprised that SphereM performs so poorly in comparison to the other positional embeddings (the difference in performance is not as striking in the Sphere2vec paper on their tasks). What is your take on this poor performance?

### Summary
In this paper, authors propose a ML model for learning feature representation for geographical space, based on spherical harmonic basis functions as positional embeddings that are well-defined across the entire globe, including the poles. Specifically, author propose ropose Spherical Harmonic (SH) coordinate embeddings that work well with a few tested neural networks, especially well when paired with Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SirenNet) .

Authors test the proposed embeddings with a few state-of-the-art models and demonstrate improved performance with their method in comparison to previous research.

### Strengths
The paper is well written, the experiments include some key datasets, used in climate science (such as ERA5). the results are well-presented and sound. The paper meets all the requirements for the ICLR publication.

### Weaknesses
The paper is quite dense, with prevalence of abbreviations and mathematical notation over the description, which makes it difficult to read, especially in  sec.3 Datasets and experiments. Readers without the knowledge of the specific datasets won't be able to understand the application. I would suggest reduce the number of the use-cases to 3 (g.g ERA5 and iNaturalist) and describe in details what exactly did authors do.

### Questions
Please see the previous section: part 3 is too dense, please insert more explanations on what was done and descriptions. Alternatively, you can include mere details as appendices for better paper understanding

### Summary
This work considers the problem of encoding geographical locations to facilitate downstream geospatial prediction tasks. The paper proposes a new approach (spherical harmonics / SH) to geographical location encoding and compares it to other approaches on a collection of real and synthetic downstream tasks. A key focus of the paper is separately evaluating the contributions of the location encoding and the network into which the location encoding is passed. 

Generally, I think this paper has value but there are a few concerns about the experimental results that need to be cleared up. 

EDIT: Increase from marginally below to marginally above after discussion.

* Results are presented with error bars. 
* The figures are well-made and informative. 
* The evaluation tasks are reasonable.
* The detailed comparison of different combinations of location encodings and network is useful for the community - as the authors point out, these have not often been studied as separate modules.

* Solid hyperparameter tuning procedures.

### Weaknesses
# When are the performance gains from SH worth it?

When using FCNet or SirenNet (which is not much of a burden in practice), the gains from SH are fairly small (<1%). The gains from SH are only large when using a low-capacity network. Similarly, in Figure 4(a) we see that the difference between $L=10$ and $L=20$ is only significant when using low-capacity networks. To me, this seems to suggest that "expressiveness" is the main issue. From a user's perspective, does it matter whether the expressiveness comes from the input encoding or the network? What's the difference in computational efficiency between SH + SirenNet and X + SirenNet where X is another high-performing input encoding? What's the best argument (combining computational efficiency and performance) that SH is worthwhile to use as a component in a real system compared to the alternatives? 

# What is the trade-off between performance and efficiency? 

Generally speaking, the "take home" efficiencies of the different methods are not clear. Figure 5 shows the computation time required to compute SH under different implementations, but the important thing is the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. E.g. is SH + Linear faster than SH + FCNet? This would be very helpful for evaluating the practical usefulness of SH. 

# Isn't network capacity and degree of fit a significant confounder in the experiments?

Following on from the previous point, FCNet and SirenNet are "typically" implemented with a certain number of layers. I might have missed it, but how many layers does SirenNet have in this work? Are FCNet and SirenNet matched in this sense? Do they behave differently as the capacity of the networks increases? What is the effect of training duration / how well the network has fit to the training data? These factors seem very important for comparing the results for these two networks, but I do not see them discussed in the text. This makes it difficult to evaluate key claims in the paper.

### Questions
See the questions/headings in "weaknesses". 

# Misc. Comments
* I suggest underlining the second-best value in each column in Table 1 to make it easier for the reader to see the magnitude of the change between the best and second-best method. 
* For context, I believe that "FCNet" in [mac2019presence] was based on an architecture found in earlier work in pose estimation [martinez2017simple].
* It's not clear that the set union notation in Eq. (2) is being used to build a vector - please clarify in the text. 
* Is there any intuition for why DFS don't perform well empirically? 
* I think the reader would benefit from a discussion of how the test sets were chosen, and why they are appropriate in a spatial prediction context.
