- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Randomized smoothing-based certification is an effective approach for obtaining robustness certificates of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks. This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.

We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 4.1x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of the approximate model from scratch.

### Summary
This paper study certified robustness with randomized smoothing. The authors present a method that decreases the sample complexity of randomized smoothing in the setting where there is a classifier $f$ and an approximation of the same classifier $f^p$ (for example, $f^p$ is a quantized version of $f$). The method, called Incremental Randomized Smoothing, proposes to compute the certification of $f^p$ via the certificate of $f$. The method relies on estimating the disparity $\zeta_x$ which is the upper bound on the probability that outputs of $f$ and $f^p$ are distinct.

### Strengths
- Randomized smoothing is an important method, and currently the state-of-the-art approach, for certified robustness. Given the computational cost of this method, it is important to investigate how to make randomized more efficient. This paper investigates how to reduce the number of samples necessary for computing the certificate via Monte Carlo sampling. 
- The paper is well-written, the theorems and algorithm are clear.

### Weaknesses
**Main Comment**.
I don't understand the main premise and setting used in this paper. I find one of the assumptions very strong and the practical implications of the method very limited. More detail below. 

The authors state the following sentence in the abstract:

_``[...] when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive.``_

Let $f$ be a base classifier, $f^p$ be a quantized version of $f$, and let $g$ be the smooth version of $f$ and $g^p$ be the smooth version of $f^p$. 
It is true that a certificate computed from the _base model_ $f$ will not hold for the quantized version $f^p$. However, it would be possible to apply randomized smoothing directly to the quantized version $f^p$ via:
$$
g^p(x) = \underset{c \in \mathcal{Y}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \ \mathbb{P}_\epsilon [\ f^p(x + \epsilon) = c\ ]
$$

Instead, the authors propose to compute the certificate of $f^p$ by first computing the certificate for $f$ (which is the unquantized model and therefore expensive to run) and then computing the disparity $\zeta_x$, which is an upper bound on the probability that the outputs of $f$ and $f^p$ are different.  
$\rightarrow$ It seems to me that this method is more expensive than computing the certificate directly on the quantized version $f^p$. 

To claim that the approach is more efficient, the authors **assume** that the certificates for $f$ are available **for all $x$**, and therefore only the disparity $\zeta_x$ is needed to compute the new certificate. The authors state:  

_``The IRS algorithm utilizes a cache $C_f$, which stores information obtained from the RS execution of the classifier $f$ for each input $x$. The cached information is crucial for the operation of IRS. $C_f$ stores the top predicted class index and its lower confidence bound $\underline{p_A}$ for $f$ on input $x$.``_

$\rightarrow$ The authors assume that the test data is already available and that the certificates have already been computed. I don't see how this can be realistic, especially since the authors mention that the quantized version $f^p$ can be used on edge devices, except perhaps if the model is only used for a limited set of inputs that are known in advance.

Can the authors comment on this and provide a practical use case that I may have missed?

### Summary
The paper deals with the problem of providing randomized smoothing-based certificates for modified neural networks. Given a modified version of a base model $f_p$ for some original base model $f$, the task is to provide a robustness certificate for the prediction of smoothed model $g_p$ at a point $x$ by efficiently reusing the values observed when calculating the certificate for smoothed model $g$ at the same $x$. The authors propose to do this using the fact that the difference between the value $g(x + \epsilon)$ and $g_p(x + \epsilon)$ around any point $x$ is very small (close to $0$) and the fact that the number of binomial samples required to estimate a parameter close to 0 is much smaller than the number of samples needed to estimate a binomial parameter close to 0.5. Given the difference in the value of $g$ and $g_p$ around a point $x$ and the certificate for $g(x)$, the authors give a formula to bound the certificate for $g_p$ at $x$.

### Strengths
- The idea of reusing the observations for calculating the certificate for $g$ to calculate the certificate of $g_p$ is novel and interesting. 
- The authors also use a great insight that it is more efficient to estimate binomial parameters at extreme ends than near the middle.
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- The practical usefulness of the proposed method is not clear. As randomized smoothing produces certificates at inference time, in order to calculate the certificate around a given point in this approach, the edge device would need access to both the original as well as the modified neural network models, which is not feasible.

### Summary
This work proposed how to certify a similar neural network via randomized smoothing by re-using the certification result from the original neural network. An IRS certification algorithm is provided in Algorithm 2 and its theory is provided in Theorem 2. The experiments on Cifar10 and ImageNet dataset showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for certifying different quantization models (fp16, bf16 and int8) and pruned models.

### Strengths
1. This work proposed a first incremental approach for randomized smoothing to certify a similar (compressed) version of the original neural network with improved efficiency by re-using the certification results. 
2. The experiments results seem to be promising.

### Weaknesses
1. Demanding prerequisite: I am not sure how likely IRS algorithm is applicable in practice. It seems like IRS will require many prerequisite. For example, IRS needs to know the certification cache from the original neural network, which makes the requirement more demanding. If there is no such information, regular RS is still needed. As another requirement, IRS needs the modified network to be a good approximation of the original neural network. Otherwise, the accuracy might be reduced per theorem 2.
2. Novelty issue with the theory: for the theory part, most of the theorems are built upon theorem 1 in [Cohen et al 2019] and are direct application of that theorem, hence raising a novelty issue.

### Summary
This work studies the efficiency of robustness certification in the case of approximated models by reusing the robustness guarantees in the original models. Specifically, the disparity between the original smoothed classifier and the approximated smoothed one is estimated to speed up the whole certification as it is relatively close to 0. The experiments show that the speed-up is obvious on different datasets with different models and smoothing parameters.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The motivation is clear and important.
- The methodology is sound and it is friendly to read although it can be formally expressed with more complicated notations.
- The experiment is extensive and validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.

### Weaknesses
- Insight 1 in Section 3.1 is not very convincing in the sense of a single setting of n=1k and $\sigma=1$, where it usually costs 10k-100k samples for Monte Carlo sampling in estimation. More examples can be given to show $\zeta$ is small.
- For insight 2 and Figure 2, although the needed samples are much less compared to 0.5, it still needs 41.5k and there is no significant reduction compred to naive Monte Carlo randomized smoothing (10k-100k). A better way is to use an example of current estimation of $p_A$ and to show the needed samples are much less when estimating $\zeta$ compared to $p_A$.
- The choice of threshold $\gamma$ seems to be critical from the experiment results and the authors use grid search to optimize it. If I understand it correctly, whether to estimate $\zeta$ actually depends on whether $\zeta$ is closer to 0 than $p_A$ is to 1. So ideally, there can be some theoretical analysis for choosing $\gamma$ in terms of $\zeta$ and $p_A$.
- I think there is a missing ablation study of directly using naive Monte Carlo to estimate $\zeta$ instead of reusing seeds in terms of both certified radius and certification time.
- There are some typos and text messed up in the last two paragraphs in Section 3.2, e.g. In case, ... are correct with...
