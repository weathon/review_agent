## Abstract
Hateful meme detection (HMD) is critical for determining whether online multimodal content carries harmful information, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining a harmonious internet ecosystem. HMD is predominantly viewed as a multimodal task, where the harmful message in memes is expressed through the information conveyed by the combination of visual and text content (e.g., the contradictions between them) rather than that from one modality. Thus, effective modeling and smooth integration of multimodal information are crucial for achieving promising HMD performance. Current research on HMD conventionally models visual and text data independently, subsequently aligns and merges these multimodal features for HMD predictions. However, existing studies face challenges in identifying hateful information that derives from the complementarities or contradictions between image and text, where in most cases neither image nor text alone carries explicit hateful information. Moreover, these studies do not leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which have been demonstrated effective in cross-modal information processing. Therefore in this paper, we propose a multimodal approach for HMD following the encoding-decoding paradigm with using LLM and a memory module enhanced by self-rejection training. Particularly, the memory module learns appropriate relationships between image and text that lead to hateful memes, where the resulted information is fed into the LLM and accompanied with visual and text features to predict HMD labels. Self-rejection training performs a discriminative learning according to memory outputs and enhances the memory module to improve HMD. We evaluate our approach on English and Chinese benchmark datasets, where it outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of all components in it and our model design.

### Summary
The paper proposes the use of multimodal Large Language Models in combination with a memory module and a self-rejection training approach for improving the state-of-the-art in the task of Hateful Meme Detection. The authors present in detail their approach and detailed experimental results on two datasets, demonstrating improved performance over a number of SotA methods.

### Strengths
- The proposed methodology appears to be sound and well-justified, and it leverages a number of recent advances in multimodal LLMs in order to reach new SotA results on the task of hateful meme detection.
- The presentation is in general very good, including both the writing of the paper and the provided figures.
- The experimental methodology is sound, including comparison to SotA and ablation studies.

### Weaknesses
- The very narrow scope of the addressed task raises some doubts about the fit of this work to a venue like ICLR.
- The experiments are limited to only two datasets.
- There are some key points that would require more elaboration (cf. Questions below).

### Questions
Nicely described context of the problem and the field's current approaches in abstract and introduction. Also, the paper's contribution is well-motivated but not concretely declared as bullet points in the last part of introduction (probably due to space restrictions) which would be very helpful to several readers.

The methodology is clearly presented and the notation is suitable. I would only demand more rigor through providing the dimensionality of all symbols.
Q1: Why perform random sampling to produce x_m? Wouldn't be the same to average the N' first vectors? Please motivate your choice.
Q2: In rejection sampling, it is unclear why should the average memory vector be equal to the vector of highest reward. Maybe I have missed something.
Answer to Q1 & Q2: The randomness is necessary to obtain x_m^*. The process is done for each (I,X) pair, so after it the best memory vector is obtained.
These questions should be answered before the reader gets confused.

Too few datasets are used for evaluation: only two while there are several meme datasets (Memotion7k, MultiOFF, Harm-C, Harm-P, etc. 

Can one gain any explainability with regards to the memory module? What does it actually learn? It seems like a black box that has been named memory module and untenably attributed with correlation-extracting functionality.

The related work is somehow poor. LLMs are missing and the meme literature while sufficient is described only in very high level.

No limitations of this work are provided, including for instance the compute requirements both for training and inference compared with the competing SotA methods for the task. 

Minor issue with respect to terminology: I suggest to use multimodal LLMs instead of plain LLMs to avoid confusion.

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work concentrates on leveraging LLMs to address the challenges of indentifying hateful information from the complementarities or contradictions between image and text. The main network follows encoder-decoder paradigm. A memory module with visual and text features is taken as encoder, and the LLM is the decoder for predicting HMD labels. Both of them are trained with the self-rejecting algorithm.

### Strengths
Taking LLM as the decoder to generate labels is novel for HMD. The authors have clearly presented their motivation and architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform previous works.

### Weaknesses
Although taking LLM for HMD is interesting, the overall methods somewhat lack novelty. 

1)The memory module is designed as a matrix. As there is no introduction about its optimization, I assume they are updated in each iteration by BP. Therefore, the modules suffer from limited novelty. In addition, current introduction cannot reflect why they are memories? What does the matrix memorized? The operations in Cross-modal Memorizing looks like attention mechanisms with visual and text features as inputs.

2)The authors should discuss differences between self-rejection training and previous methods. Current introduction makes it looks like standard contrastive learning。

Other issues:

1)From Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, it is insufficient to observe complementarities or contradictions between image and text. The authors should present more examples to demonstrate effectiveness.

2)Fig. 2 is somewhat complicated and confusing. I suggest the authors present HMD and self-rejection training by different figures.

3)The experiments can be further improved. First, the baseline performance without LLM should present in main manuscript. Second, the right column of Table 3 should be removed. The improvements seem minor. Third, from Table 5, it seems that memory module is actually co-attention mechanism. There are only ablation study for the proposed methods. The authors should present some analyse experiments, e.g., compare self-rejection training with similar methods, influences caused by different prompts.

Please address issues in the Weakness, especially issues of the novelty and experiments.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to detecting hateful memes using LLMs.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and well-motivated. Detecting hateful memes is a challenging task. The authors present a novel LLM-driven approach to detecting hateful memes. They evaluate their proposed approach on two benchmark datasets (in English and Chinese).

### Weaknesses
There are a few typos and grammatical mistakes in the paper. E.g., in Table 7 HMC is written as MHC

What might help to further strengthen/motivate such work is to show the effectiveness of off-the-shelf/fine-tuned LLMs in detecting the hatefulness of memes. With no additional components such as cross-model memorization, can we show if LLMs have the capability of predicting the hatefulness of memes?

### Questions
See my comment in Weakneses. Additionally, in section 2.2 (reward model training), the method to create the positive and negative samples is unclear. Can we elaborate on it?

Why do we restrict the proposed approach to only detect the hatefulness of memes? Why not use it for a broad range of meme understanding tasks such as harmfulness detection, offensiveness detection, etc.?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present a memory-based multimodal approach with LLM to address the Hateful Meme Detection(HMD) task. It introduces a self-rejection training strategy to update the memory vectors so it represents the semantic space for the HMD task.

### Strengths
The paper introduces a novel method to tackle the HMD task, which can be seamlessly integrated with any advanced LLM to enhance performance.
The paper achieves the SOTA performance on two distinct datasets, each in different language (English and Chinese).

### Weaknesses
The writing lacks clarity: 

Sec 2.2: Rejection Sampling, ‘we select the correlation vector with the highest reward score’. Where the concept of ‘reward score’ is introduced without an accompanying explanation. It seems being crucial for comprehending of the work.

As I understand, SRJ is introduced to train the memory vectors, there is no clarification regarding the baseline ‘+SRJ’ without memory module.
It would be helpful if the author could also provide an explanation for ‘+M’. What is the ablation way to update memory vectors without SRJ?

What are the value of N’ and M in Sec 2.1 :: Cross-modal Memorizing and the value of ‘T’ in Sec 2.2::Rejection Sampling. Is there an impact on the efficiency of the proposed approach based on these values?

Within the cross-modal memorizing module, the direct concatenation of visual and text embeddings for comparison with the memory vectors may not efficiently capture cross-modal information. Therefore, the size of the memory vectors, M, becomes crucial. It would be beneficial to include an ablation study on the memory vector size to gain further insights.

In the HMC dataset, 10% are unimodal hateful examples. So the <image, caption> pair could be hateful, do you have insights on why this may not adversely affect the model’s performance? 


Minor issues: 
1). The Figure 2 can be improved by adding explanation for the various arros and lines at the bottom. And consider using different color to distinguish between different modules. 
2). Typo in Table 7, MHC→ HMC. 
3). For the HMC dataset, the label for each split have been made available at: https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/# . Additionally,  the ‘Test’ column in Table 3 could be removed if the authors cannot find the GT labels.

### Questions
This could be an important piece of work. However, I would appreciate further clarification from the authors regarding the mentioned weakness in above.
