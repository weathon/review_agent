# Sub-token ViT Embedding via Stochastic Resonance Transformers

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 5

## Abstract
We discover the presence of quantization artifacts in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), which arise due to the image tokenization step inherent in these architectures. These artifacts result in coarsely quantized features, which negatively impact performance, especially on downstream dense prediction tasks. We present a zero-shot method to improve how pre-trained ViTs handle spatial quantization. 
In particular, we propose to ensemble the features obtained from perturbing input images via sub-token spatial translations, inspired by Stochastic Resonance, a method traditionally applied to climate dynamics and signal processing. We term our method ``Stochastic Resonance Transformer" (SRT), which we show can effectively super-resolve features of pre-trained ViTs, capturing more of the local fine-grained structures that might otherwise be neglected as a result of tokenization. SRT can be applied at any layer, on any task, and does not require any fine-tuning. The advantage of the former is evident when applied to monocular depth prediction, where we show that ensembling model outputs are detrimental while applying SRT on intermediate ViT features outperforms the baseline models by an average of 4.7% and 14.9% on the RMSE and RMSE_log metrics across three different architectures. When applied to semi-supervised video object segmentation, SRT also improves over the baseline models uniformly across all metrics, and by an average of 2.4% in F&J score. SRT also dominates test-time augmentation baselines, which we show severely harms performance. We further show that these quantization artifacts can be attenuated to some extent via self-distillation. On the unsupervised salient region segmentation, SRT improves upon the base model by an average of 2.1% on the maxF metric. Finally, we show that despite operating purely on pixel-level features, SRT generalizes to non-dense prediction tasks such as image retrieval and object discovery, yielding consistent improvements of up to 2.6% and 1.0% respectively.

### Summary
This paper proposes a "Stochastic Resonance Transformer" (SRT) method that improves the performance of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) in downstream tasks. SRT achieves this by applying controlled perturbations to input images (i.e., sub-token spatial translations) and super-resolve features of pre-trained ViTs, capturing more of the local fine-grained structures that might be neglected by tokenization.

### Strengths
Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-written and easily understandable. It effectively conveys the proposed approach and its rationale.
Simplicity and Effectiveness: The simplicity of SRT is a notable strength. Despite its simplicity, it has demonstrated high effectiveness in five vision tasks, which is a valuable contribution to the field.
Generalization Ability: SRT can be applied at any layer and on any task without fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical guarantee is missing

### Questions
1. Can SRT be applied to models beyond Transformers? It would be of interest to see empirical results exploring its applicability to other models such as ResNets or MLPs. 
2. It is important to understand the hyper-parameters involved and perform in-depth analysis when noise level can be effective or harmful. Since stochastic resonance may not be suitable for all cases, how to determine the optimal noise levels in practical applications?
3. It would be helpful to analyze the noise distribution and perform experiments using other augmentation strategies.
4. Why not conduct experiments on the main task in computer vision such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection?

### Summary
In this work, a sub-token VIT embedding based method is proposed to increase the resolution of the intermediate feature maps from VIT. The method is called Stochastic Resonance Transformer (SRT). A set of perturbations(only translations for now) are applied to the input image. These set of perturbed images are then fed into VIT to get a series of token embeddings. These features are then upsampled to higher resolution and aligned using the inverse of the applied perturbations. Statistical aggregation, including mean and median, along the perturbation dimension, produces fine-grained feature representations. This method is evaluated on multiple CV tasks like object segmentation, depth estimation and unsupervised saliency segmentation.

### Strengths
- This work introduce an interesting finding that super-resolution on the token embedding can help improve the VIT's capability
- The effectiveness of this method has been verified in multiple CV tasks.

### Weaknesses
- Perturbations are translation only. Translations are one of the perturbations, and can be replaced by a simple convolution kernel. If translation based perturbation works, then it's possible that other complex perturbations like rotation should also work. Also, since the translation works, it seems it can be replaced by an convolution network, followed by some deconvolution kernels in the upsampling stage, with some conv layers to do the aggregation. Then it will become a learnable model instead of translations only. In this way the model can not only simulate the translation, but also other non-linear perturbations.
- Did not compare with image super-resolution method. Image super resolution is an well-studied area, and it's an natural thought to try some of them and see if the generated super-resolution features can help to improve the down-stream tasks.

### Questions
- Is it possible to try other image super resolution models and see how the performance looks like? Theoretically, if the simple resizing works, then other super resolution should work better. 
- Is it possible to use some convolution kernels to replace the predefined perturbation type?

### Summary
The paper presents the problem of quantisation artefacts in ViT features as a byproduct of the standard tokenisation procedure of partitioning images into non-overlapping tokens. As a remedy, the authors propose resolving patch contributions by perturbing the input by stochastic translation of the input image and subsequent aggregation in the embedding space to extract sub-token resolution features. 

The authors directly refer to their method as a form of stochastic resonance. In classical stochastic resonance, thresholded boundaries are softened through the addition of stochastic noise, and the idea the paper seems to propose is that discrete boundaries of the partitioning can be super-resolved via stochastic perturbation with translations to allow neighbouring tokens to share information when aggregated. The goal seems to be to preserve finer grained spatial details and hence reduce the impact of the general partitioning in classical ViT tokenisation. The approach is reminiscent of classical dithering. The paper also mentions that the approach could easily be extended to other perturbations or augmentations, and is not necessarily 

Applications of the method is demonstrated, but largely limited to post-hoc or few-shot modelling approaches where features are further processed for dense prediction tasks; including upscaled feature visualisations using PCA, experiments on video object segmentation, and monocular depth prediction. Two non-dense downstream tasks are also demonstrated. 

In summary, this reviewer find certain parts of the paper interesting and novel, particularly as a ensembling distillation method. However the methodology is murky at points, and the presented problem statement and applications somewhat undersells what this reviewer consider to be the strong points of the method.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is intuitive and based on well-established principles in signal processing, while being remarkably simple to apply, similar in form to an augmentation and ensembling scheme.
- The method is essentially post-hoc and architecture agnostic as it only requires super-resolving features extracted the final layer, which could then be leveraged in potential downstream tasks, notably dense prediction tasks which require higher resolution feature attributions.
- Aside from the outlined method using translation for super-resolving features, the method itself could be formulated as general augmentation-ensembling method, and is touched upon in the paper. This further makes the method potentially interesting for self-supervision and fine tuning.
- The authors outline a distillation scheme that improves performance in certain downstream tasks. This posits the method as similar to augmentation for an ensemble based fine tuning tasks, which seems apt for further investigation. This distillation process could potentially be used in improved fine tuning for general ViT modelling approaches.
- The paper seems to want to discuss what this reviewer considers an important and often overlooked limitation inherent in the canonical ViT architecture, where uniform partitioning might not align well with the spatial semantic content in the image.

### Weaknesses
- ~~The problem the paper seeks to tackle, while somewhat intuitively reasoned, seems insufficiently motivated. The quantisation artefacts are presented as a result of discrete partitioning into uniform square patches, but the exact nature of these artefacts as well as their effect on predictions are hardly discussed or touched upon. This makes the problem statement more ambiguous than necessary.~~ **Edit:** *The last revision addresses this with a formalisation of the context of SRT.*
- While the upscaled feature visualisations show improvement on the low resolution visualisations of the base model, ~~simpler interpolation methods exist for this express purpose. It is also not clear if these new feature maps can be said to be faithful as interpretations of the importance of the features with regard to the predictions.~~ **Edit**: *The authors expand their experiments with alternative interpolation methods, however the main concern on how useful the visualisations are as attributions for model predictions is not clear. The authors revise the manuscript and does no longer claim this as one of the main contributions of the work.*
- ~~While the authors mention the conceptual overlap with Amir et al. (2021), this connection is not touched on to any further extent in the paper, except for a discussion on computational complexity. It seems natural to contrast against the results in this work since, by the authors own admission, there is an inherent similarity between approaches.~~ *The authors expands the link in their revised work with additional results.*
- Methodology for non-dense downstream tasks (particularly image retrieval) seems unclear, and hardly reproducible. Several questions remain unanswered for practitioners wanting to reproduce the results in the paper. ~~Additionally, there seems to be little to no mention of input resolutions used for the modelling.~~ **Edit:** *Note on resolution was addressed. While the authors seek to address gaps in methodology by releasing their code, more exposition in the manuscript would be ideal, but is further addressed in the last revision*.

We also detail some minor weaknesses:
- ~~The link to stochastic resonance, while somewhat clear to this reviewer, is a little opaque. While this analogy could provide an intuitive understanding of the method, it is imperative to clarify the link and show the extent to which quantisation artefacts inhibit ViTs. Stochastic resonance typically involves the enhancement of weak signals in the presence of noise. In this context, techniques are applied for extracting super-resolved features by treating the discrete boundaries imposed by the partitioning in the tokeniser as the thresholds. In this reviewers opinion, the link should be emphasised and clarified to improve the overall contribution of the paper.~~ *The authors agree that this is an issue, and have substantially revised their manuscript.* 
- While the authors highlight the computational limitations of ensembling, at times the wording in the article seems to point to computational benefits, e.g. "Practical implementations demonstrate efficient execution on even laptop GPUs". ~~At the same time, the study is limited to ViT-S16 capacities due to computational considerations. While we wholeheartedly agree that not all studies need to be extrapolated to models with huge memory footprints, the limitation to small architectures strikes the author as a little too restrictive, and using a base model (ViT-B16) would have been more convincing.~~ *The authors included larger models in subtasks and expand their results for segmentation in the revised paper.*
- While the method is novel, the current applications seem moderately niched.

**Summary from rebuttal:** *Several of the concerns were addressed in the last revision, and while certain doubts still linger on the potential impact of the method given the role of new tokenisation methods to alleviate quantisation artefacts, the method is novel with promising initial results.*

### Questions
- ~~What is the precise nature of the artefacts the authors wish to remedy? Are the authors arguing that the low resolution PCA / attention maps exhibits these artefacts by virtue of having low resolution?~~ *This was addressed in the last revision.*
- Have the authors considered adding metrics for evaluating the faithfulness of the attributions in the visualisations of the features? **Edit:** *The authors downplay the contribution of the visualisations in their contributions, addressing this concern.*
- ~~Why were contrastive comparisons to Amir et al. (2021) (in terms of results) omitted?~~ *The authors diligently expand the discussion and experiments in the revision. The exposition from the rebuttal could be meaningfully be appended to the manuscript for a more nuanced read.*
- ~~Exactly which embeddings were used for the KNN in the image retrieval task? The ensemble of class tokens? Pooled features? This is very unclear.~~ *The authors address this in their revision, however the methodology for non-dense prediction tasks is still unclear.*
- ~~The metrics for results in table 4, are they mAP? What does the columns 1-6 refer to?~~ *The authors address this in the revision.*

An additional question was added in discussion:
- ~~The scores with salient segmentation using TokenCut omit comparisons with post processing using the bilateral solver proposed in the original paper. The reasoning behind this choice seems unclear [...]~~ *The authors addressed this by expanding their results.*
