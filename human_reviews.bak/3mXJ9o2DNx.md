- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Distribution shifts between training and testing datasets, contrary to classical machine learning assumptions, frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. Studies on domain generalization (DG) thereby arise, aiming to predict the label on unseen target domain data by only using data from source domains. In the meanwhile, the contrastive learning (CL) technique, which prevails in self-supervised pre-training, can align different augmentation of samples to obtain invariant representation. It is intuitive to consider the class-separated representations learned in CL are able to improve domain generalization, while the reality is quite the opposite: people observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the CL theory and discover the lack of domain connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. Thus we propose domain-connecting contrastive learning (\model) to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. Specifically, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced into self-contrastive learning to improve domain connectivity. Furthermore, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the domain connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement it with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are provided. The results verify that \model~outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of distribution shifts between training and testing datasets in domain generalization (DG). Contrary to expectations, applying contrastive learning (CL) directly in DG settings leads to performance deterioration due to the lack of domain connectivity. To address this, the authors propose domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), which introduces aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples to improve domain connectivity. They also propose model anchoring to exploit domain connectivity in pre-trained representations. Experimental results on standard DG benchmarks demonstrate that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, even without domain supervision.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents the paper clearly, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. The exploration of why contrastive learning (CL) is detrimental to Domain Generalization is an intriguing topic.
2. The paper offers a noteworthy contribution by highlighting the finding that pre-trained models with better domain connectivity can lead to improved performance. The authors provide a clear and reasonable definition of domain connectivity, enhancing our understanding of this important aspect.
3. Through extensive experiments on standard Domain Generalization benchmarks, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL) method, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. One potential weakness of the paper is that it may overstate its claims regarding the theoretical analysis of why Contrastive Learning harms the performance of Domain Generalization models. The current version lacks rigorous theoretical analysis and relies more on heuristic motivation rather than providing concrete theoretical explanations.
2. Although the paper proposes improving the similarity of representations across different domains as a key contribution, similar ideas have been previously proposed and utilized in the literature, such as in [1]. This could be seen as a limitation in terms of originality.
3. The proposed Generative Transformation Loss for Pre-trained Representations raises concerns. The approach of fine-tuning the model to align $z$ and $z^{pre}$ appears counterintuitive, as it may reduce performance when using $z$ for prediction. This introduces a potential trade-off between the ERM loss and the Generative Transformation Loss for DCCL, which needs to be carefully considered.
4. The paper fails to adequately explain the relationship between domain connectivity and the classification/regression performance, which is the ultimate goal of Domain Generalization. While domain connectivity is an important metric to consider, the authors do not sufficiently address how it directly impacts the predictive performance of the models in real-world scenarios.

### Summary
This paper focuses on self-supervised learning, especially contrastive learning for domain generalization settings. They analyze the phenomenon with the CL theory and discover the lack of domain connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. Thus they propose domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL) to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for
DG.  Some data augmentation strategies are introduced. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. I think applying contrastive learning to DG is very interesting, and might inspire more work in this direction.
2. The proposed idea is very simple but effective.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern is the discussion of domain connectivity. Is this connectivity based on sample connectivity? Recent work, such as [1], also proposes similar connectivity for domain adaptation but is overlooked in the paper. 

2. What is the high-level motivation for the generative transformation loss？Is it necessary to use augmentation of the same sample, acquiring the class knowledge more effectively?

### Summary
The paper focuses on addressing the shortcomings of self-contrastive learning in Domain Generalization (DG). To enhance domain connectivity within Contrastive Learning (CL), the authors introduce two strategies. Firstly, they suggest anchoring learned maps to pre-trained models that already exhibit the needed connectivity between training and testing domains. Secondly, they introduce a Generative Transformation Loss to further enhance alignment. The paper showcases the effectiveness of their approach, termed DCCL, through extensive experimentation on five DG benchmarks.

### Strengths
The majority of the paper is straightforward to understand.

### Weaknesses
Regarding the motivation behind the proposed method, I have three inquiries:
1. Could you elaborate on the challenges faced when implementing self-contrastive learning in DG?
2. What drove the need for more intensive data augmentation and the inclusion of cross-domain positive samples?
3. Please shed light on the rationale for model anchoring, particularly leveraging domain connectivity in pre-trained representations and its synergy with generative transformation loss.

Notably, the model is constructed on the foundation of SWAD. When evaluated across five benchmarks, the performance improvements over SWAD are recorded as 1.0, 2.9, 3.7, 0.9, and 1.0 respectively. An ablation study assessing the effectiveness of the three components of the proposed method was specifically conducted on the benchmark with a 2.9 gain. Would it be possible to also conduct the ablation study on benchmarks that achieved a performance gain of 1.0 or less? My curiosity stems from questioning whether all three components consistently contribute to the effectiveness as presented in the paper.

### Summary
Authors incorporate contrastive learning into domain generalization by modifying the contrastive strategy with the help of cross-domain samples and pretrained representations. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness.

### Strengths
The idea and logic are basically complete. 

Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, including ablation studies for three components each.

### Weaknesses
- The toy experiment of illustrating the drawbacks of directly applying SCL to DG is put in appendix, which is a key part of the entire logic of this paper and should be emphasized. However, this part currently seems confusing and hard to follow, and the removal of data augmentation in this experiment make it too unrealistic. 
- The term "domain connectivity" is a little confusing. It is more like "domain-invariant intra-class connectivity", while "domain connectivity" seems like inner-domain connectivity. 
- Experimental improvement is generally not large compared with current SOTA.

### Questions
- In Sec 3.2, whether samples come from the same domain or not, they belong to positive pairs as long as they are from the same class. I understand this has the benefit of not using domain labels, but if truly targeting at cross-domain positive pairs, only samples from the same class but belonging to different domains should be treated as positive pairs, otherwise it cannot be determined whether "cross-domain" is important here. 
- In Sec 3.4, why is the generative transformation loss needed when there is pretrained model anchoring already? I think both of them serve as regularization to constrain the representation space not far away from the pretrained representation space. From this perspective, generative transformation loss seems a little ad-hoc. 
- In appendix C, paragraphs are duplicated. As stated above, I think this part is an important component of the whole paper story, so I wonder if authors can modify it into a clearer version.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new domain generalization method that consists of a ERM loss, a contrastive learning loss with cross-domain data augmentation and a generative transformation loss that exploits the supervised signal at the inter-sample. Experimental results seem to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper is clearly written and generally easy to follow.

- The experimental results look good and the proposed DCCL achieves very competitive performance on a few benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
- The combination of contrastive learning and continual learning has been explored and shown effective multiple times. See [1,2]. The contribution of this work is mostly on how you augment the positive samples. The way the paper augments the samples across different domains is similar to [3,4].

- I fail to understand why generative transformation helps. Could the authors elaborate more on why learning an additional decoder for the generative transformation can help domain generalization? I can see that this is to exploit more information from the sample itself, but why it can make domain generalization better is unclear.

- Overall, I find the proposed method a bit ad-hoc, as it combines multiple disconnected components to improve the final performance. Why these components can work coherently to benefit the domain generalization task is unclear and also poorly motivated. It is insufficient to simply state that some losses are for intra-sample level and some for inter-sample level. It still does not explain why it works.
