- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Path planning underpins various applications such as transportation, logistics, and robotics.
Conventionally, path planning is formulated with explicit optimization objectives such as distance or time.
However, real-world data reveals that user intentions are hard-to-model, suggesting a need for data-driven path planning that implicitly incorporates the complex user intentions.
In this paper, we propose GDP, a diffusion-based model for end-to-end data-driven path planning.
It effectively learns path patterns via a novel diffusion process that incorporates constraints from road networks, and plans paths as conditional path generation given the origin and destination as prior evidence.
GDP is the first solution that bypasses the traditional search-based frameworks, a long-standing performance bottleneck in path planning.
We validate the efficacy of GDP on two real-world datasets.
Our GDP beats strong baselines by 14.2% ~ 43.5% and achieves state-of-the-art performances.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new technique for path planning, specifically path generation, on graphs such as road networks. 

The key innovation is a diffusion model over a graph, capable of learning a probability distribution of paths from a set of expert demonstrations. Initially, a diffusion model for vertices is defined using the graph Laplacian, which is then extended to create a diffusion model for paths. Once learned, the model can be used for path generation through conditional sampling given a pair of origin and destination vertices. A significant advantage of this approach is its capacity to learn expert paths without assuming that they minimize linearly accumulative costs, a departure from standard search-based path planning.

The proposed method is evaluated on real-world road network datasets and is shown to outperform several existing methods.

### Strengths
**Originality**: Although previous work has leveraged diffusion models for path or motion planning, the use of diffusion models on a graph for path generation tasks seems novel. The ability of the proposed model to generate paths without assuming linearly accumulative costs is intriguing.

**Quality**: The overall quality of the work is high. The proposed method is well-designed and technically sound.

**Clarity**: The paper is well-written, with clear statements of the work's motivation and contribution.

**Significance**: The significance of the proposed method is evaluated on a real road network dataset, a strong point of this work, although I have some concerns about the dataset itself, as shown below.

### Weaknesses
While the proposed method's ability to bypass the linearly accumulative cost assumption is appealing, it's unclear if the path planning tasks for the collected datasets used in the experiment require such assumptions. In other words, I'm not sure if the dataset is fully suited to demonstrate the proposed method's significance.

In fact, the performance improvements over Dijkstra search are not very significant in terms of the DTW metric. With only average scores reported, it's unclear whether the proposed method demonstrates overall small improvements or if there are a few samples in the dataset where baselines completely failed to work. Similarly, the performance difference between the proposed method and CSSRNN is relatively small in Table 3. Does this suggest that path planning on the new dataset can be mostly solved by existing approaches that assume linearly accumulative costs?

Another concern is the computational cost. Classical path planners like Dijkstra are appealing because they can run quickly even on CPUs. In practical situations, people use path planning (e.g., route search on a map app) on mobile devices that don't always have sufficient GPU resources. It's not clear how much computation resources are required by the proposed method and other baselines.

### Questions
- Does the dataset contain a sufficient number of paths that don't follow the linearly accumulative cost assumption? At least the standard deviation or confidence intervals should also be reported in each table, but I wonder if the proposed method's strength could have been demonstrated more systematically using synthetic data that simulate paths that existing methods cannot plan or imitate from demonstrations? Such controlled experiments can be as important as real-world data evaluations.
- How does the proposed method compare to other baselines in terms of computational costs?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a diffusion-based model for end-to-end data-driven path planning, called GDP. GDP models path planning as a conditional sampling task. Its objective is to determine the probability distribution of paths given an origin and destination. To solve this task, GDP uses a diffusion-based architecture.

The authors evaluated the GDP model using two real datasets, City A and City B. They compared against traditional optimization methods as their baselines, including Dijkstra's algorithm, NMLR, Key Segment, and Navigation API from Amap. The result shows that the paths generated by GDP are closer to the ground-truth paths than those baselines.

### Strengths
* The paper proposes a sound diffusion-based model for path planning. The proposed model achieves better performance than the traditional methods on public datasets.

* The paper is very well-written. The structure is clear, and the evaluation is thorough.

### Weaknesses
* The improvement from the GDP model over the Navi baseline is relatively small.

### Summary
This work propose a GDP, a diffusion model on graphs, which is able to conduct path planning in an end-to-end manner. The experiments are conducted on two real city datasets and compared against four baseline planners, showing that GDP is able to generate paths very close to the groundtruth.

### Strengths
1. The technical part is solid and using diffusion model to address the path planning is interesting.
2. The performance is evaluated on big and real city datasets and promising results are shown.

### Weaknesses
I can not accurately tell the weakness of this paper. Please see my questions below.

### Questions
1. How do you deal with the unsuccessful planning tasks? 
2. Have the authors compared the latency of GDP with other models, because latency is also crucial in giving real-time path solution, and I am concerned that diffusion model can be slow due to many iterations of run.
3. What is the motivation for unconditional path generation? Is it for preparing a high-quality roadmap for the following specific tasks?
4. How do you compare your method/contributions with Motion Planning Diffusion [R]?

I hope the authors can address my questions and I will be glad to adjust the score afterwards.

### Summary
The paper tackled the problem of building a novel conditioned sampling method to mimic user historical paths on a graph. To implement the sampling process in the manner of diffusion models, the authors reviewed requirements based on previous work. They formulated the forward and backward process following the heat conduction on the graph. Experimental comparisons with the proposed method and existing methods show the promising performance of the diffusion-based method for the task.

### Strengths
- Clear explanations of the motivation and background concept (of conditioned samples through diffusion models) for the targeting task (i.e., end-to-end path planning).
- Mathematically solid contribution through the heat conduction on graphs to build diffusion models.
- Good experimental performance for the end-to-end path planning.

### Weaknesses
- Following the existing literature (e.g., Austin et al. 2021 and Yi et al. 2023), the novelty of the contribution is less explained (the background idea and reasons to follow the heat conduction on graphs, although the performance is good).
- Possibly, the discussion between the continuous space (i.e., latitude-longitude vectors) and discrete space (i.e., the sequence of nodes on a graph) is not included in the paper (e.g., NeurIPS'23 DiffTraj.); the difficulty of discrete spaces or similarity between the two models are better to be explained.
- Many details are included in the appendix, making the main paper hard to read and follow the details.

### Questions
- Do we have any discussions on the parameters of diffusion processes: examples are the length of diffusion time (i.e., t=100 in Fig. 3 in city B).
- Related to the 2nd point of the weakness above, I'm curious about the relation between the diffusion models among those for continuous spaces and those for discrete spaces (i.e., this paper). I found that DiffTraj in NeurIPS'23 tacked a similar problem, but they seem to focus on the continuous space. Therefore, please clarify the difficulty of discrete spaces or the similarity between the two models. (Of course, if such a paper overlaps with the submission of ICLR, you can refer to other papers used as baselines of DiffTraj). To clarify the difference, your contributions are expected to be clarified and explained well.
- I cannot completely follow the discussion of introducing U-net for the purpose of $\mathbf{x}_0$: Could you give some additional explanations? (In experiments, for example, they are static (OD-pairs seem to be known), but some probabilistic characterization as a distribution p(x0) is required for the diffusion process; is this right? In Line 2 of Alg1, $\mathbf{x}_0$ is sampled from $p(\mathbf{x}_0)$, but I'm confused that $\mathbf{x}_0$ is already known?)
- As the dataset contains multiple OD pairs, I’m curious about the std. of the metrics (DTW, LCS): Does the GDP show good performance for almost all OD pairs? Are there any specifically difficult trajectories according to their conditions?

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of sampling paths on a graph. Their approach makes use of recent developments on argmax flows, that allow for the definition of diffusion with categorical variables. 
Their insight is that they can use a heat equation to model the transition probability matrix of a specific graph, with the heat transfer defined by the adjacency, balanced by the degree.
They then use this to define their forward diffusion process. They use a sequence of conditionally independent nodes to model a path, and use post processing to ensure connectivity. They demonstrate the value of their approach on a series of datasets, outperforming baselines.

### Strengths
- Algorithms on graphs are very useful in practical applications
 - The heat conduction approach is elegant, and I think quite clever

### Weaknesses
- The work seems to cut some corners when it comes to sampling connected paths, post-hoc processing is required
 - The path length seems like an integral part of the problem, but is only discussed very briefly in the appendix.

### Questions
Overall I enjoyed reading this paper. I think the core of the method is good, interesting, and useful. I do have some questions:

 - In Table 3, the authors present an ablation as "trivial uniform diffusion". Do the authors mean the "generic categorical diffusion" with Q = $\alpha_t I + \beta_t 1 1^T / V$? If this is the case, the authors should make that more clear so that readers may enjoy the significant improvement their work brings. If this is not the case, and the authors mean something else, they should run another ablation using "generic categorical diffusion" as a baseline, since that seems like the relevant benchmark to beat.
 - Can the authors elaborate on the beam search aspect, and how often a sampled path is actually invalid (i.e., disconnected, or with loops, etc), and what heuristics are used to fix those sampled paths?
 - Can the authors discuss their Guassian mixture model for path lengths in some more detail? While some metrics are provided in the appendix, it is not clear what information this model takes, if any. It seems to me that path length is highly dependent on origin and destination, so I assume their mixture model takes these as input. Can the authors elaborate exactly what the structure of this model is?
 - What is the scaling of the algorithm? Especially compared to Dijkstra? Both in terms of path length, and number of graph vertices.
 - Can the authors elaborate on how they generalize to paths without learning a joint distribution across time? Sampling nodes independently certainly would not yield a sensible path. I could imagine this would work if the reverse process was conditionally independent (i.e. $x^i_{t-1} | x_t$, the latter $x_t$ being _all_ nodes instead of $x_t^i$), but eqn 9 does not actually seem to suggest that. The text touches on this (end of paragraph 3 in 4.3, "masking $\hat{x_0}$"), but to me this statement is quite uninformative, and seems like a very essential point of the paper.
 - Does it generalize to different graphs? i.e. do you need to retrain for each city?

Minor points:
The text is generally well written, but it seems like a few paragraphs were missed during the proof reading stage.
A non-exhaustive list:
 - first paragraph of 4.2 
 - first paragraph of sec 5
 - App. D
 - 6.2 paragraph 2
 - typo in Fig 2. "Pais", it is also confusing for 3rd panel to say "Real", since the text says these were generated using Navi
