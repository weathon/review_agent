# Enhanced Bayesian Optimization via Preferential Modeling of Abstract Properties

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 1, 3, 3

## Abstract
Experimental (design) optimization is a key driver in designing and discovering new products and processes. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an effective tool for optimizing expensive and black-box experimental design processes. While Bayesian optimization is a principled data-driven approach to experimental optimization, it learns everything from scratch and could greatly benefit from the expertise of its human (domain) experts who often reason about systems at different abstraction levels using physical properties that are not necessarily directly measured (or measurable). In this paper, we propose a human-AI collaborative Bayesian framework to incorporate expert preferences about unmeasured abstract properties into the surrogate modeling to further boost the performance of BO. We provide an efficient strategy that can also handle any incorrect/misleading expert bias in preferential judgments. We discuss the convergence details of our proposed framework. The empirical results show the efficacy of our proposed method.

### Summary
The authors propose to ease black-box optimization tasks by integrating both black-box function evaluations over input designs as well as human preferences between different designs. In the Bayesian framework, this boils down to a combination between Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Preferential BO (PBO). Human preferences can be of significant interest as 1) they are cheaper with respect to black-box function evaluations for costly objectives and 2) humans perform comparisons at an abstract level using concepts that may not be easily measurable. The proposed method, Bayesian Optimization with Abstract Properties (BOAP), integrates human preferences directly into the statistical surrogate used during BO by extending the input space with additional dimensions that contain learned human preferences. To further account for unreliable human feedback, BOAP keeps track of two surrogates, with and without human preferences, and selects which one should be used to obtain a new design at every iteration based on a criterion.
 BOAP is then evaluated on a range of problems and demonstrates an improvement over the vanilla BO setting, even for unreliable experts.

### Strengths
- The method is easy to understand and well-described throughout the paper. It provides a simple way to leverage different kinds of data (scalar values of a black box function and human preferences).
- The authors give some hints from a theoretical perspective as to why using expert feedback might lead to faster convergence.

### Weaknesses
- There is no notion of human query cost compared to the black-box function evaluation cost. For expensive black-box functions, I can easily imagine that querying the human is cheaper, but if many comparisons are needed. However, as such, it is difficult to assess the benefit of the method. BOAP provides a way to integrate expert preferences, and yes this yields an improvement for relevant preferences, but this is assuming a null human query cost, and perhaps things would be different 
This is even more salient for unreliable expert feedback. For instance, Figure 6 shows the performances of the method for noisy expert preferences. While it seems that BOAP is somehow robust to noisy expert feedback, reverting back to vanilla BO in the worst case, it most likely would be the worst competitor if the expert query cost is now added. 
This being said, this "weakness" is directed towards the evaluation protocol rather than the method itself.

This is more of a remark than a weakness properly speaking: I believe that the ICLR conference is generally skewed towards Deep Learning methods and the many approaches that revolve around that field. Bayesian Optimization has been quite successful for hyperparameter optimization of complex deep learning models and therefore fits the scope. However, the present submission does not seem to aim for such applications. In particular, no deep learning-related applications were provided in the experiments. Furthermore, as this submission proposes a way to integrate human preferences to the BO setting, I would say that comparing hyperparameter sets is probably not the most manageable problem for human experts, hence I think that the submission may not wholly fit the scope of ICLR.

### Questions
Q1: During experiments, we begin with $p = (t' 2)$ preferences, ``that gets updated in every iteration of the optimization process''. Can you clarify this? If we begin with 5 initial observations, there are 10 preferences. Once the 6th sample is acquired, is it compared with the 5 previous ones, so that we now have 15 preferences, and 21 in the next iteration, and so on? If so, this leads to a great number of comparisons, which again raises the question of the human query cost w.r.t. black-box function evaluation cost mentioned above.

Q2: In all the experiments considered, the expert is simulated, and considered to reason over high-level features which are then used to perform the comparisons and learn the preferential Gaussian process whose posterior mean is then added as additional input dimensions to the BO surrogate. How would this method compare with actually using the high-level features directly as additional dimensions? e.g. for Benchmark-1d, the input space would be $[x, \exp(2-x)^2, \frac{1}{x^2}]$. I think this can be intriguing specifically given that preferences are only ''identifiable'' up to a monotonous transformation (e.g. if an expert would have latent utility function $x \mapsto x$ or $x \mapsto \sqrt{x}$, he would still give the same answer for a given comparison). If performances are significantly different, one could investigate whether this has to do with this identifiability issue or not. This can also be done in "real-world experiments" as high-level features are also derived in this case.

Q3: P5 of the appendix, it is mentioned that ``if we use all training instances for the computation of the log marginal likelihood, there are chances that only Control arm may get selected in majority of the rounds. Therefore, to avoid this, instead of using all the training instances for computing the marginal likelihood, we use only the subset of the original training data for finding the optimal hyperparameter set and then we use the held-out instances from the original training set to compute the (predictive) likelihood''. I must say that I don't fully understand this phenomenon, could you clarify why this happens?

Q4: To select which GP surrogate to follow (with or without human preferences and additional dimensions), the predictive likelihood of both models is compared. But the latter does not incorporate a notion of model complexity, right? I would have thought that the augmented model better fits the data given that it has more flexibility, even though for Gaussian Processes in a low-data regime (as in BO), having extra dimensions might not be a blessing. 
From a more general perspective, I think that mentioning additional ways of selecting which surrogate to use would have benefited the paper. I can think of at least one: placing a sparsifying-prior on the (squared-inverse) lengthscales, such as the horseshoe prior, as was done by Eriksson and Jankowiak [1]. 

Some additional remarks:

- Simple regret and Bayes Regret are never defined formally in the paper, adding a definition in supplementary would be valuable.
- On the contrary, the UCB acquisition function is defined in the supplementary, but nowhere used in the paper.
- In the Supplementary, Eq.17 involves two different notations for a function $\Gamma$
- I don't think the search space for the synthetic experiments is mentioned anywhere in the text.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for incorporating abstract properties, a novel form of prior information, into of the objective function into the Bayesian optimization loop. Abstract properties refer to auxiliary, immeasurable traits of the objective, which by assumption are indicative of performance. User preferences over abstract properties are modeled by a rank GP. The rankings are subsequently incorporated by adding dimensions to a conventional GP regression that is subsequently used for BO.

### Strengths
__Interesting idea:__ Querying the user for feedback (specifically for ranking-based feedback) appears useful and digestible for practitioners.

__Novel quantities:__ I have not seen abstract properties be discussed as a concept previously, and while I am not convinced of their prevalence in practical applications, the notion of incorporating _immeasurable_ auxiliary quantities is enticing.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, I believe this paper has substantial flaws in terms of the validity of the method, the presented theory, results and communication. As such, I believe this paper needs substantial re-work for it to be publishable. 


- __Convergence remarks:__ This subsection is rather informal. I do not believe that postulation is appropriate when considering theoretical convergence, but the assumption also appears incorrect based on existing theory.
_(...) accurate feedback of relevant abstract properties should, we postulate, reduce the eluder dimension of the model_.

Regarding convergence of the proposed method, I believe there is only one certainty: the proposed method _adds_ dimensions to the problem. As shown by Srinivas. et. al. (2009), the information gain scales exponentially in the dimensionality of the problem, assuming equal lengthscales (Bergenkamp et. al. 2017). Furthermore, the eluder dimension clearly increases in the dimensionality of the problem ($\mathcal{F}$ changes with the added dimensions) so the above statement is, to the best our knowledge, incorrect.

Lastly, the bounds on _information gain_ (IG) only hold for a select few kernels, and spatially-varying kernels are not included in this class. As such, IG bounds do not hold, either.

The entirety of Sec. 3.4 is based on seemingly incorrect assumptions. Further, it contains no _proven_ theoretical insights. As such, I believe this section should be fundamentally reworked or removed.  

- __Addition of dimenions:__ I struggle to see how adding dimensions to the problem aids in optimization. This is a counterintuitive action, and the authors should undertake great effort to shed light on this. This is currently missing from the paper altogether.

- __Obscure aspects of method:__ I believe a collection of methodological choices are not sufficiently communicated. These are all outlined in the questions section.

- __The concept of abstract properties:__ Moreover, the abstract properties that are introduced appear measurable, and as such, amenable to multi-objective (or multi-fidelity, depending on the property) optimization. Since these properties are _abstract_, I would encourage the authors to further motivate why they are abstract (i.e. immeasurable) and why existing BO approaches are ill-suited. 

- __Structure of the methodology section:__ A substantial part of this section (3.1.1, 3.1.2) appears to be background work, and 3.1.2 (MAP estimation) specifically is standard BO convention. The methodology should primarily cover the novel aspects of the work, so including these here blurs the contributions of the work. I suggest for 3.1.1. to be moved to Sec. 2 and 3.1.2 to be moved to the Appendix. The same goes for ARD (3.2 second paragraph).

- __Notation:__ The set $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}, y = h(\mathbf{\hat{x}}) \approx f(\mathbf{x})\})$ is incorrect notation and difficult to parse regardless. Moreover, observations are occasionally denoted $(\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{x}))$, should be $(\mathbf{x}, y)$.
- __Results:__ Few tasks, very few iterations and low repetitions (as seen by the very non-smooth regret plots) yield results that have low credibility and offer few substantial takeaways. Moreover, the high-level features seem _very helpful_, so I believe these should be substantially ablated.


__Minor:__ 
- Variables are re-declared multiple times throughout
- The rank GP is frequently referred to as _"Rank (preferential) GP"_. Please use either rank or preferential, as the dual naming and parentheses do not add clarity.
- _Information gain_ versus _information-gain_. Please use the former.

### Questions
__Methodology-related questions - should be clarified:__
- Why are the lengthscales fixed (as opposed to the conventional ARD) for the original input dimensions? How are they fixed?
- What is the _"maximum predictive likelihood"_ by which the model is chosen -  the one with the highest marginal log likelihood? 
- One model strictly has more capacity than the other, so how would the non-user input model ever be chosen? 
 - How frequently is each model chosen?
- How is the next input chosen along the added $m$ dimensions, which are dictated by human feedback? 
- Are the $m$ dimensions amenable to typical acquisition function optimization, and do they actually result in a point to query?  (it seems like _output_, rather than _input_)

__General questions__:
- What is the procedure for providing abstract features in the results? Can these be provided as continous functions, or are they given pointwise? If pointwise, how are they provided for the synthetic functions?
- What is the definition of an abstract property? Immeasurable? If so, I would suggest calling it "immeasurable", as calling it "abstract" is, quite fittingly, a bit abstract.
- How frequently does the user have to be queried for feedback / how many user queries does a 20 iteration run entail?

### Summary
This paper proposes novel human-AI collaboration BO algorithm: Bayesian Optimization with Abstract Properties (BOAP) where the input of the main GP f in BO is augmented with latent preference GPs posterior means to construct an augmented GP h. BOAP then adaptively switch between f and h when performing BO. The author examined BOAP via theoretical discussion and empirical evaluation.

### Strengths
- Incorporating human feedback into BO is an interesting and important problem.
- The proposed method is well-motivated as it seeks to incorporate human feedback.
- The paper has contained both theoretical and empirical evaluation, with the experimental results consist of both various synthetic and real-world problems

### Weaknesses
While this work presented a well-motivated method, many design choices throughout the algorithm appears to be arbitrary, and the author did not provide enough theoretical or experimental justification to those choices. Some examples include:

- (in 3.1) “To do this, we utilize an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) kernel where we set the lengthscales of the augmented input dimensions in proportion to the rank GP uncertainties” —> why this instead of learning the parameters as one would typically do with GP models? Have we run ablation studies on how exactly we are choosing the scale parameter \alpha? inverse std? inverse var? or some other notion of uncertainty? The author has provided some explanation to that choice, but it is not convincing that this is the best choice here without additional evidence.
- If we are able to model those abstract properties with preference models that we believe are compositional parts (or contain important information) of the function of interest f, why don’t we explicitly exploit this compositional structure as done in Astudillo and Frazier (2020)?
- Similar to above points, the author does not describe how the preference P is constructed and updated (i.e., how are the queries selected. Randomly?). Does P gets updated? If yes, how (L13 in algorithm 1 is unclear) If not then the number of possible comparisons entirely depend on the initial dataset, and are either very limited or we need a large init set, which isn’t feasible.?
- Theoretical discussion seems a bit hand-wavy and are based not entirely justified assumptions (e.g., “If neither model has a consistently higher likelihood…”)

The experiments section can also be significantly improved by exploring

- The paper would benefit more from investigating the impact of preference data P. Querying human experts is an expensive procedure, and in the BOAP algorithm, we have to query human expert p times for each of the
- Human mistakes are mentioned multiple times throughout the paper but the author doesn’t investigate how different kinds/scales of human errors can affect the performance of BOAP. Similarly, different human preference querying strategies are not explored. Astudillo and Frazier (2020) and Lin et al. (2022) have shown that querying the DM different questions (e.g., using the EUBO acquisition function) can have significant impact on the downstream model performance.

The writing, particularly implementation and design choices details (e.g., how are expert preferences dataset being constructed precisely), can be improved.

Finally, while the author has experimented with different test functions, there are only two real-world problems and the performance of BOAP in those problems are only marginally better than the baseline methods.

Minor points:

- L12-13 should be indented to be inside the loop.

### Questions
- “Although we anticipate that experts will provide accurate preferences on abstract properties, the expert preferential knowledge can sometimes be misleading” —> what does misleading mean here?
- Have the author compared the impact of using log-likelihood of rank GP instead of Evidence, as the former appears not to take uncertainty in \omega into consideration, where the latter marginalize out the (latent) GP function distribution, arguably a more principled Bayesian treatment.

### Summary
This paper explores a new Bayes Opt method that incorporates human rank-based feedback as well as direct experimental feedback. As such, it is a human-in-the-loop algorithm. To achieve this, multiple GP models are trained. For the human feedback, $m$ rank GPs are trained. The mean values of each rank GP are then incorporated as additional predictor variables in the main GP that predicts the overall objective. The uncertainty in the rank GPs are used to guide the lengthscales in the kernel of the main GP. Finally, a GP trained without any of the human-derived extra features is also trained, in case expert feedback turns out to be inaccurate. Experiments conducted: synthetic experiments, real dataset experiments where some data fields are regarded as expert derived ranks instead.

### Strengths
- The paper clearly describes the scenario that it is designed for
- The authors have attempted to use the uncertainty from the rank GPs in the main GP by incorporating the uncertainties into the lengthscale
- Some theoretical discussion is advanced to suggest that the convergence rate of BOAP will be the maximum of the convergence rates that one would find with the augmented and unaugmented GP models in isolation

### Weaknesses
- The concatenation of different GP models, using some as inputs to others, is not rigorously investigated. What happens when kernel lengthscales are dynamically set based on a different model at different inputs? Is this provably a positive definite kernel still? 
- The approach is based on modelling both the objective functions and the user-derived feedback given $\mathbf{x}$ where neither are yet observed. What assumptions tell us that predicting the $\omega$ properties first and then predicting $y$ is easier than predicting $y$ directly? In the synthetic experiments this is clear- the functional relationship between $y$ and the $\omega$ is somehow simpler than the relationship between $y$ and $\mathbf{x}$ directly. It would be nice to clarify and understand these assumptions more carefully. 
- The theory quoted in this paper from Russo & Van Roy, 2014 may not be directly applicable. The theory assumes the model is a GP, which is not guaranteed with this input-dependent lengthscale. The theory further assumes the GP model itself is fixed, whereas in the paper both GP hyperparameter optimization and updates to the $\omega$-GPs are applied at each step. (Cf. Section 6.3 of the Russo & Van Roy paper)
- The real-world experiments synthesise human feedback by converting some columns of real data into unobserved rank data. No actual human-in-the-loop experiment is conducted

### Questions
- what existing work has been done on using GP-predicted values as inputs to another GP? Has anyone studied this model? Do we know if it is actually a (mathematical) GP?
