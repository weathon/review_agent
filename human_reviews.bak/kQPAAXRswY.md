# Stabilizing Policy Gradients for Stochastic Differential Equations by enforcing Consistency with Perturbation Process

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Deep neural networks parameterized stochastic differential equations (SDEs) received increasing attention from the machine learning community due to their high expressiveness and solid theoretical foundations, with a wide range of applications in generative models. However, maximizing likelihood of training data, the objective of generative models, does not always meet our requirements in many real-world problems. Fortunately, introducing reinforcement learning (e.g., policy gradient) here to maximize a reward, using SDE-based policy, may bridge this gap. Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories, it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled. These challenges compromise the stability of policy gradients and negatively impact sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned problems. Our framework offers a general approach for training SDEs using policy gradients, allowing for a versatile selection of policy gradients to effectively and efficiently train SDEs. We evaluate our algorithm on the task of structure-based drug design and optimize the binding affinity of generated ligand molecules. Our method achieves the best Vina score (-9.07)  on the CrossDocked2020 dataset.

### Summary
This paper aims at mitigating the inherent instability associated with policy gradient estimation when employing Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based policies rooted in the physical modeling of the diffusion model. This principle exhibits a broad applicability, adaptable to diverse policy gradient techniques. Empirical findings from experiments demonstrate a substantial outperformance of benchmark models, underscoring the considerable promise of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
This paper offers a simple principle to alleviate the instability of the policy gradient estimation with SDE-based policy from the physical modelling of the diffusion model itself. The principle is general to be instantiated to various policy gradient methods. The experiment results  significantly outperform benchmarks, which shows the convincing potential of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
Although the proposed method appears to have the potential for instantiation in REINFORCE and DDPG, empirical evidence regarding the improvements from the perturbation process sampling remains unclear for both of these methods. While the authors have explained the necessity of the perturbation process using toy examples in Section 3, it would be more instructive and convincing if they could illustrate the quality of policy gradient estimation for both the vanilla policy gradient method and the perturbation process-enhanced versions.

Furthermore, the experimental results are limited to the SBDD task, which does not fully demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method in a more convincing manner.

### Questions
Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the definition of the perturbation process and ensure consistency in Definition 1? I am not an expert in diffusion models, and at this point, I can only regard the perturbation process as a mechanism capable of generating realistic sample paths for the estimator. A more intuitive definition and explanation would greatly enhance understanding for readers like myself who may not be well-versed in this area.

### Summary
Deep neural networks parameterized stochastic differential equations, which are especially important for their use in generative modeling, are trained by maximizing likelihood of training data. To use this for generating samples that maximize a user-desired criteria, reinforcement learning can be used for training. However, policy gradient-based optimization methods for reinforcement learning suffer when data is scarce, leading to instability and increasing sample complexity during training. The authors propose to mitigate this problem by making the trained SDE consistent with the associated perturbation process, which is global and covers wider space than training samples. The authors propose actor-critic policy gradient algorithm, and showcase their method’s efficacy on the problem of structure based drug design.

### Strengths
The authors described the problem and motivation in their abstract and introduction. The section about the challenges of applying policy gradient to SDEs (section 3) demonstrates that the author makes an effort to show motivating examples. The figure captions are detailed, and the related works are cited.

### Weaknesses
After reading the paper, I am not sure what the authors are trying to achieve. It seems to me that SDE is a tool for distribution modeling (modeling maximum likelihood), and they would like to use this approach to maximize some "rewards". If this is what the authors are trying to do, why should I care about distribution modeling? I mean, how does this improve standard optimization approaches, such as local search, monte-carlo tree search, reinforcement learning, etc? Why do I need to use this fancy SDE idea to search for molecules of some good properties? I think the authors have an intricate problem to solve, but the presentation is far from clear.

The authors need to make the equations and their associated explanations easy to read for general readers. The organization of the paper can be improved to increase clarity. Here are a few questions that the authors may consider clarifying in their revised manuscript. For example:

1.	In equation 1, what is sigma_t?
2.	Why is it natural to train SDEs with RL? What if the training data only consist of samples with desired characteristics? Do we still need RL in that case? The authors cited relevant work, but the basic idea/counterexample should be mentioned here (in a sentence)
3.	In equation 5, where is p_t as mentioned afterwards?
4.	Figure 1 and 2 needs to be further up in the paper, as they are the motivating examples for authors’ rationale of the paper.
5.	In section 2.3, it is better to state that the MDP is mapping to Equation 5 rather than Equation 1.
6.	In definition 1, what is p0,q0? There are no such symbols in Equation 1.

### Summary
This paper proposes a regularization methods to improve the insufficient coverage issues in policy gradient estimation for the task of applying reinforcement learning to fine-tune diffusion model. Numerical result on a highly-relevant example shows promise of this method comparing to existing a number of baselines.

### Strengths
The method has good intuition and is interesting. Numerical performance of the proposed method outperforms the other baselines by a substantial margin.

### Weaknesses
It was not clear why reinforcement learning can effectively respect the boundary conditions of the underlying problem while supervised learning approach fail to do so beyond the numerical results. How would an alternative method fail, for example, one that encodes both model matching score and the desired properties into the objective function and then solve the corresponding supervised learning problem, was not articulated.

### Questions
- Is the superiority shown in Figure 3 (and also Figure 5 in the appendix) a statistically consistent behavior across majority of examples? Are the numbers shown in the table in Figure 4 possible to have the standard deviation annotations next to the mean and medium values?
- It is surprising that from Figure 4 it seems that TargetDiff does not respect the boundary at all, which seems to be contradicting one of the contributions claimed by the TargetDiff authors. Are there some structural properties associated with these scenarios? Is this a consistent behavior in the majority of the cases?
