# Communication Bounds for the Distributed Experts Problem

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 8, 3

## Abstract
In this work, we study the experts problem in the distributed setting where an expert's cost needs to be aggregated across multiple servers. Our study considers various communication models such as the message-passing model and the broadcast model, along with multiple aggregation functions, such as summing and taking the maximum of an expert's cost across servers. We propose the first communication-efficient protocols that achieve near-optimal regret in these settings, even against a strong adversary who can choose the inputs adaptively. Additionally, we give a lower bound showing that the communication of our protocols is nearly optimal. Finally, we implement our protocols and demonstrate empirical savings on real-world benchmarks.

### Summary
The article focuses on the expert problem in the distributed setting, where an expert’s cost needs to be aggregated across multiple servers. Each server is faced with a different instance of the Expert problem. In this work, the authors considered various communication models such as the message-passing model and the broadcast model, along with multiple aggregation functions, such as summing and taking the maximum of an expert’s cost across servers. This article presents the first communication-efficient protocols that guarantees near-optimal regret in these settings, even against a strong adversary who can choose the inputs adaptively.

### Strengths
In this article, communication versus regret tradeoffs in various scenarios are considered, which are of great interests to the distributed online learning field. The proposed algorithms have achieved near-optimal regret using much less communication than the baseline EWA algorithm, that is DEWA etc. Moreover, lower bounds are provided to show either the regret or communication bound of the algorithms is optimal.

### Weaknesses
My major concerns lie in the motivation of this work.
The problem considered in this paper should be better motivated with convincing application examples. Admittedly, the expert problem has achieved great success with broadly employed in may practical application scenarios, but regarding the distributed setting, it is hard for me to map it to any specific application scenario. To make the contribution clear, please provide some examples and discussions on that in the introduction part.
In addition, both the communication protocols mentioned in this paper rely on a coordinator. Why is it a reasonable assumption. Does it make any difference on the results if we change the model to a fully distributed one? 

Also, all the experts are forced to commit to the same expert according to the depicted problem setting. Please provide reasons for making such an assumption. 

The presentation of this work is poor and should be substantially revised.

The simulation results are too simple without any support of real-world data traces and lack comparison to other related works.

### Summary
This paper studies the communication efficient algorithms for a distributed expert problem. In this problem, the cost function associated with each expert is split among multiple servers, and hence, the goal is to find the most communication-efficient learning strategy considering the cost of fetching information from the server as the communication cost. The paper considers two types of cost functions (sum and max) and two communication models (broadcast and message passing) and proposes multiple algorithms to tackle this problem.

### Strengths
++ The studied problem is interesting, timely, practically relevant, and intellectually challenging. 

++ The authors consider multiple settings of the problem and propose algorithms for diverse settings of the problem.

### Weaknesses
-- Overall, the writing of this paper needs substantial effort to be ready for publication. The current format does not provide enough details and insights into algorithms and theoretical and numerical results. For example, in the current presentation of the introduction, there is no direct mapping between the theory results summarized in Tables 1 and 2, and those descriptive statements of the paragraphs on top of page 3 of the paper. 

-- Also, earlier in the introduction, the authors try to distinguish their work with the streaming algorithms claiming that in their setting, the coordinator does not have any memory constraints. However, later in the introduction, they talk about lower bounds in the case of limited memory.

-- I am not sure how much making an assumption of $T=O(\log(ns))$ makes sense since, typically, in an online learning setting, the time horizon is assumed to be sufficiently large such that the sublinear regret in $T$ makes sense. 

-- The description of the algorithms is very brief and technical and does not provide any insights into the algorithmic steps and ideas. This reduces the paper's readability for a broader audience. In addition, the paper's organization in terms of theoretical results is not clear a lot of theorems are presented inside the algorithm section, while there is a separate section for formal guarantees. 

-- The numerical evaluation is very brief and does not provide any comparison between the proposed communication-efficient algorithms and other possible algorithms that try to be aware of the communication costs. Also, the benchmark is not introduced and even cited in the paper. The experimental setup is not clearly defined, and the impact of parameters is not investigated.

### Summary
This paper presents a distributed variant of the expert problem. In this problem, there are a set of several servers, and there is an instance of each expert on each server. The authors consider two objectives; one objective is to minimize the sum of costs across the servers, while another objective is to minimize the maximum cost achieved across the servers. The authors also consider two message passing protocols, namely a protocol in which the central coordinator communicates directly with one server at a time, and a protocol in which the central coordinator can broadcast a message to all servers. The authors develop several algorithms with associated regret and communication costs, and also provide a lower bound communication cost for this problem. Some computational experiments are provide, applying these algorithms to a benchmark related to hyperparameter optimization.

### Strengths
The problem considered is interesting, and the theoretic results are reasonably strong.

### Weaknesses
Some critical assumptions made by the authors seem to be going unstated. Most critically, the authors don't state any assumptions about the costs $l_i^t$ other than that they are in $[0,1]$. It seems that the authors are assuming that $\\{l\_i^t\\}\_{t=1}^\infty$ are i.i.d. or something similar, but this is not stated anywhere.

Overall, I thought that the problem could be motivated better. It would help to provide more details about the HPO-B benchmark, as well as providing other instances where the distributed experts problem could apply.

The computational experiments are pretty sparse. I'm not sure why Exp3 is only compared against against the authors' algorithms with $b_e=1$ and EWA is only compared against authors' algorithms with $b_e=n$. It would also be useful to show experiments with $b_e$ taking a wider range values, to understand how this value affects the performance of the algorithm.

### Questions
What are the assumptions placed on $l_i^t$?

### Summary
This paper proposes the experts problem in the distributed setting. The idea is that each expert i experiences a loss at each step j at each time step t. Thus, the losses are l^t_i,j \in [0,1]. Looking at (generally a subset of) historical data, the algorithm needs to pick an expert at each time step t, so as to minimize regret (as compared to choosing the best possible fixed expert with hindsight). The key distributed twist to the problem is that communication cost is considered alongside regret, thus obtaining obtaining historical data from servers has a cost; in this context, two cost models are considered: message-passing and broadcast. Furthermore, multiple aggregation methods are considered for total loss: in summation aggregation, the cost of an expert is the sum of the cost of an expert across servers; in maximization aggregation, the cost of an expert is the max cost of that expert across servers.

The paper gives algorithms and lower bounds, and discusses trade-offs between regret minimization and communication minimization. The upper bounds are in the strong (adaptive) adversary model, where an adversary get to observe the full history realization before choosing the costs at the next time step. Lower bounds are in the weaker, oblivious adversary model; this means the lower bounds are more powerful, since they apply even if the adversary is weak. However the lower bounds require memory bounding assumptions; this means that the lower bounds are less powerful, since they only apply when the memory restrictions exist.

The paper also provides experimental data comparing its algorithms with distributed adaptations of classical multiplicative weights.

### Strengths
Originality: To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper on Distributed Experts. I believe the problem is interesting, non-trivial, and has the potential to kick off a series of papers on the topic. There is also scope for expansion of the problem, by adding in extra factors, such as privacy and asynchrony. 

Result Quality: None of the theorems are proved in the body of the paper. I don’t anticipate that their proofs involve substantial novelty. I think the more substantial contribution of this paper is its model which expands the scope of the experts problem to the distributed setting. That, I feel, is a good quality contribution.

Writing Quality / Clarity: The paper was readable with effort (this is not true of all papers).

Significance: I think the topic of study is novel, and interesting, especially in a world where distributed systems, distributed machine learning, and distributed inference are increasingly relevant.

### Weaknesses
Originality: The algorithms and analyses are not particularly novel, but they do need to adapt ideas from the non-distributed world appropriately, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they took some effort to adapt correctly.

Result Quality: The results likely involve limited technical ingenuity. 

Writing Quality / Clarity: The paper could use improvement in the writing. In particular, the first paragraph should describe the problem in more detail: when it says the experts make predictions, a reader would assume the prediction matters; however, in the model of the paper, experts don’t matter; it is also relevant that the adversary must pick the costs in a bounded interval, in this case [0,1]; without explaining these types of details clearly, the substance would be confusing to readers who are not familiar with the experts problem, or even those who are familiar with it, but have seen other versions of the problem.

Significance: Like most papers at ICLR, this paper is probably of interest to a small subcommunity at the conference. Once again, I believe this is true of most papers, so it is not a negative comment towards a paper.

### Questions
My assessment of the paper is that the major contribution of this paper is in the problem definition, lifting the experts problem to the distributed setting. However, I’m of the impression that the algorithms and analyses are largely straightforward, given what is known about the experts problem in the sequential setting, and given the statement of the distributed setting—which is a novel contribution of the paper. Is this assessment correct in the authors’ opinion? If not, what are the most interesting technical contributions of this paper in terms of algorithmic ingenuity or analysis?
