## Abstract
Distributed learning has gained significant interest recently as it allows for the training of machine learning models across a set of *heterogeneous* agents in a privacy-preserving manner with the growing amount of distributed data. In this paper, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of Generalized Distributed SGD (GD-SGD) under various communication patterns among agents, including Distributed SGD (D-SGD) and its variants in Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. We examine the influence of agents' sampling strategies, such as *i.i.d.* sampling, shuffling methods and Markovian sampling, on the overall convergence speed of GD-SGD. We prove that all agents will asymptotically reach consensus and identify the optimal model parameter, while also analyzing the impact of sampling strategies on the limiting covariance matrix that appears in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our results theoretically and empirically support recent findings on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, and generalize previous findings on the efficient Markovian sampling strategies from vanilla SGD to GD-SGD. Overall, our results provide a deeper understanding of the convergence speed of GD-SGD and emphasize the role of *each* agent's sampling strategy, moving beyond a focus on the worst-case agent commonly found in existing literature.

### Summary
The manuscript studies the asymptotic convergence of a generalized distributed SGD method (GD-SGD) for distributed leaning problem. The authors consider various communication patterns and different sampling strategies, including iid sampling and Markovian sampling, for GD-SGD. They show the influence of sampling strategies on the limiting covariance matrix according to the definition of Loewner ordering, which is also examined in a regularized logistic regression task.

### Strengths
1. The authors analyze the asymptotic convergence of the D-SGD algorithm under more general communication topologies and different sampling strategies including iid sampling and Markovian sampling. The theoretical analysis seems solid.

2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. There have been many studies on communication topology in existing work, e.g., [Koloskova et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2021)]. Generally speaking, as long as assumption 2.5 is made, the consistency of the distributed learning algorithm can be guaranteed, so the GD-SGD algorithm designed in this paper is not novel.

2. Technically, the main proof techniques used in the paper can be found in [Li et al. (2022)] and [Hu et al. (2022)], except for the expansion of the communication patterns. Therefore, combined with the first weakness, the technical contribution of the paper is insufficient.

3. The analysis and comparison of different sampling strategies in Cor. 3.4 are trivial. The authors only give a qualitative comparison of different sampling strategies based on existing work [Hu et al. (2022)]. In fact, this simple relationship can be easily generalized in existing works with both asymptotical and non- asymptotical results. From this point of view, the contribution of this article seems to be over-claimed.

4. Logistic regression is a toy model, it is better to further consider other real-world models.

### Questions
One of the key concern of the reviewer is on the fundamental difference in proof techniques compared to [Li et al. (2022)] and [Hu et al. (2022)]; the authors should properly address this. 

Another concern of the reviewer is that the results established in this paper are in an asymptotic sense; can these results be extended to non-asymptotic ones?

### Summary
This work revolves around distributed learning and specifically studies  the asymptotic behavior of Generalized Distributed Gradient SGD under various communication patterns and sampling strategies. The authors provide theoretical results showing asymptotic consensus convergence across clients and analyze the impact of different sampling strategies on the limiting covariance matrix. Those results provide useful insights and the generalized framework under consideration incorporates numerous results as special cases such as SGD and Distributed SGD. Experimental results on CIFAR10 further support the theoretical findings.

### Strengths
-This paper studies an interesting framework in distributed learning. Analyzing the Generalized Distributed SGD provides useful insights and the derived theoretical results are aligned with the results from numerous prior works (observed as special cases).

-The importance of sampling strategies for the convergence rate is being explored as well as different communication patterns in Generalized Distributed SGD.

### Weaknesses
-The theoretical results of this paper appear to be straightforward extensions of existing works (Morral et al., 2017; Koloskova et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2022). As a result the theoretical contribution, novelty and impact of this work appears to be marginal.

-The analysis although insightful is asymptotic in nature which somewhat diminishes the impact of the results.

-Although, there is extensive description on how the current findings are aligned with known results, the authors do not emphasize enough on the new challenges they had to overcome in order to derive their theoretical results or discuss how their work is more challenging from related works. 

-The structure of the introduction could be improved curving out a related work section.

-The experimental results provided are limited to the CIFAR10 dataset.

### Summary
This paper provides an asymptotic convergence analysis of generalized distributed SGD (i.e., with a time-varying communication graph, c.f., Kolosokova et al.). It underlines the dependence of the limiting covariance matrix on each client's data-sampling strategy. The paper's main contribution is identifying that while non-asymptotic analyses of GD-SGD using Markovian sampling rely on the mixing time of the worst agent, the asymptotic analysis can benefit from every agent (not just the slowest one), improving their sampling strategies (c.f., Corollary 3.4). Simulations are provided to judge how quickly optimization enters the asymptotic phase and whether client sampling strategies affect the convergence rate.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, and the results are rigorously discussed. The paper highlights an essential difference between asymptotic and finite time bounds and how the latter might sometimes be misleading while looking at client sampling strategies. While the idea of looking at asymptotic regimes and Markovian sampling is not new (as can be seen in Table 1), the paper offers an interesting insight.

### Weaknesses
I feel that technical comparison to existing work is lacking. While the table summarizes the existing results and what settings they operate in, it does not discuss what are precisely the bounds obtained by papers such as Doan et al. (2017). As a result, it is unclear whether these bounds actually fail to capture the effect of sampling on all the clients. All the results in this paper require Assumption 2.3. Was that required by the previous papers as well? The experiments at least seem to suggest that an increasing number of local steps is not needed (I am assuming a constant step size was used in the experiments).

### Questions
- Can the authors comment on technical comparison to related works, as I mentioned above? 
- What were the technical challenges of going to the distributed setting from the known serial analyses? Are any novel techniques needed? Theorem 3.2 seems like a corollary for an existing result.
- What is the step-size schedule in the experiments?
