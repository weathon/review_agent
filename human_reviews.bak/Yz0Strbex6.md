# A Note on Some Statistical Properties of Signature Transform Under Stochastic Integrals

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 8

## Abstract
Signature transforms are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time time series data, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection. This paper revisits some statistical properties of signature transform under stochastic intergrals with a Lasso regression framework, both theoretically and numerically. Our study shows that, for processes and time series that are closer to Brownian motion or random walk with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, the Lasso regression is more consistent for their signatures defined by Itô integrals; for mean reverting processes and time series, their signatures defined by Stratonovich integrals have more consistency in the Lasso regression. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing appropriate definitions of signatures and stochastic models in statistical inference and machine learning.

### Summary
The paper investigates signature transforms of time series data using a Lasso regression framework:

For time series resembling Brownian motion with weak correlations, Lasso regression aligns better with Ito integrals.
 For mean-reverting processes, Stratonovich integrals are more consistent. 

The paper supports the theoretical findings with numerical experiments on synthetic data like Brownian motion and OU processes.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written, with a great review for signatures. 

The propositions and the numerical results are well presented.

### Weaknesses
The paper is mainly concerned with the whether Ito or Stratonovic signatures to combined with LASSO will result in a higher statistical consistency. However, the investigation is limited to very specific examples (such as Brownian motions and OU processes). It would have been a stronger paper if it provided a more detailed guideline as to when each of these should be applied. Even an extensive empirical study leading to an intuitively appealing empirically supported guideline would have made the paper stronger.

### Questions
While it is obvious from Figure 1 that Ito signatures are more consistent, the conclusion that Stratonovic signatures are more consistent can not be drawn from Figure 2 (as far as I can see).  Is there a theoretical explanation as to why this is happening?

### Summary
Signature transformation transforms a time series $\mathbf{X}\_n$ into point statistics $ S(\mathbf{X}\_n)\_T^{\ldots}$. In this paper, the authors study relationship between a random process (Brownian motion, random walk, OU process, and AR(1) model) underlying $\mathbf{X}\_n$, an integral method (Itô  or Stratonovich) for defining the signature transformation, and result of signature-based Lasso: they discuss consistency properties of “estimate of sign of parameter” when performing Lasso regression for $\\{(S(\mathbf{X}\_n)\_T^{\ldots}, y\_n)\\}\_n$ with $y\_n$ generated from a linear model with noise based on $ S(\mathbf{X}\_n)\_T^{\ldots}$. Through this study, the authors state “Our study shows … the Lasso regression” and a more generic fact “Our findings highlight … and machine learning” (both of which are written in abstract).

### Strengths
I have understood that the authors claim “Our study shows … the Lasso regression” (claim1) and a more generic fact “Our findings highlight … and machine learning” (claim2), both of which are written in Abstract. I have focused on verifying claim 1 only since claim 2 is too generic and trivial (if this is wrong, please let me know what problems have arisen due to existing studies’ indifference to the integral method). According to this standpoint, I have wrote following comments.

1. The paper is well-written (presentation is good).
2. Propositions and Theorems are correct.
3. Feature selection techniques may be a good option to improve regression based on signature transformations. This is because users will want to use somewhat large $K$ since an appropriate value of $K$ is not known in advance, but in that case the number $\frac{d^{K+1}-1}{d-1}$ of predictors becomes large (when $d\neq 1$).
4. Discussion between Proposition 7 and Example 1 supports claim 1 to some extent.
5. Program codes are reliable.

### Weaknesses
6. I have thought that the sentence “Given the successful application … time series data” expresses the motivation for this study. However, this motivation is too abstract. I would like to see a concrete description as to why discussion to support claim 1 is demanded.
7. Most of the related studies seem to be published by the same research group. I am concerned about this point. For example, all the application paper cited in Section 1 (except for the arXiv paper (Arribas, 2018)) were published by the same research group. I cannot know if unrelated researchers recognize the usefulness of signature-based techniques in their applications. Please tell me about some interesting applications that unrelated researchers have done. Also, I think that the authors should cite such papers as well. I think that this is needed for an ICLR paper. This comment has nothing to do with whether the authors of this paper belong to that research group.
8. In recent years, “series-to-point non-linear (neural-network-based) regression”, which is an end-to-end regression in the setting of this paper, has been well studied. For example, studies referred in Section 3.3 of “Ahmed, S., Nielsen, I. E., Tripathi, A., Siddiqui, S., Ramachandran, R. P., & Rasool, G. (2023). Transformers in time-series analysis: A tutorial. Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, 42(12), 7433-7466”. Is there a practical advantage to doing “point-to-point linear regression via signature transformation”? (I may have missed a cited paper that makes such a comparison. I'm sorry if that's the case. Please tell me that paper.) Considering readers of ICLR, it is worth mentioning the comparison between such techniques and signature-based ones. Also, the input dimension $\frac{d^{K+1}-1}{d-1}$ of “point-to-point linear regression via signature transformation” can be larger than the input dimension $d T$ of “end-to-end regression”. Is this a negative factor of “point-to-point linear regression via signature transformation”?
9. I would like to ask for additional explanation of interpretations of signature $ S(\mathbf{X}\_n)\_T^{i\_1,\ldots,i\_k}$ for each combination of $i\_1,\ldots,i\_k$. There are generally two main types of evaluation strategies of Lasso: regression error or parameter estimate error. This research focuses on the latter, which means emphasizing the interpretability of the parameter estimate itself. For that position, the interpretability of signatures should be important.
10. I could not understand the meaning of the experimental comparisons for Figures 1 and 2 to support claim1. When integral methods are different, the generated data (in particular, $\\{y\_n\\}$) are different, and data analysis methods (the sets of features used for Lasso regression) are also different. For example, for data analysis in real situation, only one data is given, so analysis with different generated data is useless. In particular, since the comparison uses different data, I think that there is a gap between the experimental results and claim 1. Contrary, if the authors want to focus their discussion on the influence of the integral method on the distribution properties of the signature, it would be natural to consider with a single data analysis method. Please tell me more specifically what the authors want to claim with the experimental comparisons for Figures 1 and 2, and in what situations that claim is useful.
11. Another problem is that consideration and explanation of reasons for the experimental results are not sufficiently described. (I imagine that multicollinearity among the explanatory variables $ S(\mathbf{X})\_T^{\ldots}$ influences the experimental results; is it right?)
12. Regarding “Other feature selection techniques” in Section 5. The ridge regression is not used for feature selection typically. Rather, it will be better to cite, for example, bridge regression (Frank, I. E., and Friedman, J. H. (1993), “A Statistical View of Some Chemometrics Regression Tools,” Technometrics, 35, 109–135).
13. $\\{\epsilon\_n\\}\_n$ in (3) requires 0-mean assumption at least (otherwise $\tilde{\beta}\_0$ will be biased).

### Summary
The paper presents an analysis of signature transforms applied to Lasso regression of synthetic continuous time series data. Signature transforms are known for their ability to linearize the problem of feature selection. 

The main contribution of the paper is the exploration of the correlations of these transforms when applied to Brownian motions and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. This is done for signatures defined by Ito and Stratonovich integrals. They achieve this by analyzing the signatures' definitions in the context of different stochastic integrals and directly manipulating the resulting expressions. Then, using the Irrepresentable Condition (which, as proved in [Zhao & Yu '06], is almost equivalent to sign consistency of the Lasso estimator), study the consistency of the Lasso estimator when applied to the inference of labels generated from the signature transforms of these stochastic processes.

These results are then contrasted with numerical simulations that compare the performance of this signature-based regression under both Ito and Stratonovich integral definitions. Their findings suggest concrete settings under which signature transforms defined over one or the other integral definitions should be preferable.

### Strengths
The paper is structured in a clear way and is well written, which makes the results easy to understand. While the results are mainly theoretical, the authors contrast them with numerical simulations which allows them to strengthen their conclusions. Also, Proposition 7 an easy-to-check condition to establish the sign consistency of the Lasso estimator studied. Finally, the discussion regarding the preference for different integral definitions in signature transforms is interesting and could provide insights that could be relevant for further research in the field.

### Weaknesses
There are two main issues that prevent me from recommending the acceptance of the work:

- It is not entirely clear to me that Lasso regression combined with signature transforms constitutes a widespread methodology used by numerous researchers/practitioners. The references listed do not seem to be enough to support this. Furthermore, in the introduction it is claimed that, on several important Machine Learning problems, this methodology yields state-of-the-art results. But many of the references provided to support this are rather old for the standards of the field. Thus, it is not clear that this is indeed the case. All lead me to think that, although the paper has clear merits, it could maybe be a better fit for a more specialized venue than ICLR. However, if the authors could provide further references to change this opinion, I would be willing to upgrade my evaluation.

- The second one being that consistency does not appear to be the most relevant performance metric for this kind of problems. First because it only describes the large sample limit of the estimator and does not give insights about its performance for, the usually more realistic, finite sample scenarios. But also because, as discussed by the authors themselves, this measure can be too restrictive. It is true that the authors go on to explore other performance metrics in the appendices; but they do so only in a numerical way. Finally, sign consistency cannot be defined in a misspecified setting.

### Questions
In this section I list some minor questions and suggestions aside from the major ones expressed in the "Weaknesses" section.

- Although the results presented rely on the Irrepresentable condition, little is discussed about it. It is also stated that it "is almost a necessary and sufficient condition for Lasso estimator to be sign consistent". But the meaning of "almost" is never explained. It is my opinion that, if some further discussion were added on this respect, the results could be better appreciated.
- Is the bound in Proposition 7 expected to be tight under certain regime? When is it loose? It would be good if some details about this could be added.
- In the discussion of the main results it is said that, because experimentally good regression results are obtained for fairly small K, then this bound "can be fairly easy to verify". I think this phrase is somewhat vague.
- I think it would be good if some heuristic interpretation of why different performances for signatures defined with Ito and Stratonovich integrals are observed.

### Summary
This paper studies the Lasso consistency of signature transformation of time series. A signature of order k for a d dimensional time series is defined as a path integral of the time series over a sequence of indices $i_1, i_2, \cdots, i_k$. Signatures are powerful tools in machine learning.  The universal non-linearity property states that any continuous function of the time series may be approximated arbitrarily well by a linear function of its signature.
This paper studies the consistency issue of Lasso for signature transforms.  Feature selection with lasso regression has been studied extensively in the literature. Consistency is an important metric for out-of-sample model performance. This paper determines which signature gives a more lasso consistency of a given time series. Particularly, Ito integrals are more suitable for time series  close to
Brownian motion or random walk; whereas Stratonovich integrals have more consistency for mean reverting processes.

### Strengths
This is a solid paper that provides both a theoretical and numerical study of the lasso consistency of different signatures. The paper rigorously defines and analyzes the consistency of Lasso regression in signature transformations. Given the useful properties of signature transformations in feature selection, this is a nice result determining which signature transform provides better consistency for Lasso regression.

The paper reads well and seems correct, but I did not check all the proofs.

### Weaknesses
I do not see any major weakness in the paper. I think the paper is a bit compressed, which probably makes it harder to read for a broader set of readers. It would be nice if the authors gave more explanations of their results in the main body of the paper.

### Questions
What is the domain of $\beta$'s values in (3)? How does this equation relate to the feature selection problem where one selects a subset of features from a the larger original collection of the features?
