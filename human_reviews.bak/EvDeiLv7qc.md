- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 8

## Abstract
The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a widely known neural architecture where  an ensemble of specialized sub-models optimizes overall performance with a constant computational cost. However, conventional MoEs pose challenges at scale due to the need to store all experts in memory. In this paper, we push MoE to the limit. We propose extremely parameter-efficient MoE by uniquely combining MoE architecture with lightweight experts.Our MoE architecture outperforms standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and is on par with full fine-tuning by only updating the lightweight experts -- less than 1\% of an 11B parameters model. Furthermore, our method generalizes to unseen tasks as it does not depend on any prior task knowledge. Our research underscores the versatility of the mixture of experts architecture, showcasing its ability to deliver robust performance even when subjected to rigorous parameter constraints.

### Summary
The authors propose a new Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method which uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. In particular, the authors target two pre-existing PEFT methods which are (IA)3 and LoRA, and replace the vectors in (IA)3 and LoRA components in LoRA with MoE modules - MoV (Mixture of Vectors) and MoLoRA (Mixture of LoRA) respectively. The authors show the effectiveness of the proposed methods by comparing the downstream task fine-tuning performance. MoV and MoLoRA outperforms (IA)3 and LoRA performance and show similar performance as full weight fine-tuning. The authors also add various ablation studies including different routing strategies, varying number of experts, and expert usage on different tasks.

### Strengths
- The authors show that a simple combination of two well-known methods (PEFT and MoE) can achieve better quality.
- Overall, the proposed method is well described and the paper is easy to follow

### Weaknesses
- Training and inference efficiency analysis is missing. Table 6 briefly touched on the training of MoV case, but it would be good to have more comprehensive analysis such as memory consumption and training time. Also, LoRA has an advantage that the LoRA components can be added to the original weight and no additional inference cost is incurred. On the other hand, MoE might introduce some overheads. As this paper is about an efficient method, this kind of analysis will make the paper more comprehensive.
- Even though MoV and MoLoRA use small fraction of the original model parameters, they are using quite more parameters than (IA)3 and LoRA. This is important because we are handling quite larger models these days and those information would be useful to consider. Therefore, the information about how much memory consumption and the number of parameters will increase (not full fine-tuning experiments) would be useful to have.

### Questions
- 'efficiency side-effects': side-effect usually means negative, but here constant inference cost is a positive thing.
- page 2, Contributions (3): 'higly' -> 'highly'
- Do you have any insights why more number of experts doesn't always give better results?

### Summary
This paper aims at conducting efficient instruction tuning with language models equipped with mixture of expert layers, while to manage the large computational cost, the authors propose to consider each single copy of PEFT parameters as an expert instead of a copy of MLP, the common definition of experts, for better usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MOV and MOLORA architectures.

### Strengths
- The authors utilize extensive accuracy vs. compute figures to demonstrate the superior efficiency.
- The authors emphasize the scalability of the proposed methods, which is important for large models.
- The paper writing and architecture is clear with easy to read.

### Weaknesses
- About expert specialization and load balancing: 
  - One of the fundamental reasons to utilize MoE-style architecture is expert specialization.
  - In Sec. 3, the authors mention to apply load balance loss specifically for discrete merging. Is load balancing applied also for soft merging? And does soft merging rely on load balancing loss to prevent expert collapse? 
  - If not, how to specilize the abilities of each expert to obtain the results in Fig. 5 with simple token-level routing without any explicit control?
  - If indeed we can get specialized experts, does the similar distribution shown in Fig. 5 suggest that the evaluated tasks still have connection with the several training tasks, otherwise it is hard to understand why a linear router can generate such a low entropy distribution on the evaluated tasks with a zero-shot setting?
  - In other words, if the evaluated tasks differ from the training tasks a lot, the reasonable routing distribution should be close to uniform, especially for a linear router.
- About parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT):
  - Another way to view this work is another way to increase amounts of PEFT parameters.
  - But one perspective of current development of PEFT is that the amount of parameters is the most important, while how you deploy the parameters does not make much differ.
  - In Tab. 1, comparing LoRA (r=4) & MoV-10, LoRA (r=8) & MoV-30 and LoRA (r=16) & MoV-60 (all pairs with similar learnable parameters), the performance gaps are 2.42%, 1.72% and 0.29%, greatly shrinking with respect to the number of parameters, doubting about the scalability of the proposed method. 
- Overall, 
  - From the perspective of MoE, this paper shares similar architecture with [1], and unfortunately still cannot answer the basic question including why the specialized architecture can benefit instruction tuning on novel tasks.
  - From the perspective of PEFT, the methods can still not convince me that it is non-trivial to other PEFT methods by simply adding more parameters for better results.

### Questions
- Implementation details:
  - Soft vs. discrete merging: There are two things to decide, including how many experts to choose and how to combine these experts. According to the equation in Sec. 2.2, does soft merging suggest that you first ensemble different expert weights according to the router output and then conduct forward propagation for only once? If so, does this manner only apply for (IA)3 or for LoRA with discrete merging also, since the previous manner is different from our common modeling of MoE architecture? Would you mind further explain how you conduct this ablation?
  - What is the "average median score", the main evaluation metric used by the authors, first mentioned in the first line of Page 6?

### Summary
The authors propose a parameter-efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) training approach. By combining MoE architecture with lightweight experts, the paper introduces Mixture of Vectors (MoV) and Mixture of LORA (MoLORA), optimized for parameter efficiency training.  In particular, each expert is replaced with a lightweight PEFT adapter such as $(IA)^3$ vectors or LORA adapters. The proposed MoV and MoLORA, are highly efficient in terms of parameters. By updating less than 1% of the model’s parameters, MoV and MoLORA consistently maintain higher performance compared to standard PEFTs and achieve comparable results with full fine-tuning.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, presenting a clear and sound approach. The subject matter is highly relevant to the ML community, addressing a critical challenge: while MoEs holds great potential, its practical application has been notably hindered by prohibitive computational expenses and training instabilities, rendering it inaccessible to many researchers. Showing that parameter-efficient methods such as $(IA)^3$ or LORA can substantially improve the feasibility and effectiveness of training MoEs is a significant and valuable contribution to the field.

The authors have provided extensive ablation studies, systematically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed MoV and MoLORA approaches against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies, and full fine-tuning. The evaluations cover multiple model sizes from the T5-family, adapter types, the number of experts, and routing mechanisms.

### Weaknesses
- All experiments in this paper have been conducted exclusively on T5 model family (encode-decoder architecture). Showing that the proposed light-weight MoEs additionally works for decoder-only architectures would significantly strengthen the paper’s contributions and findings.

- The zero-shot evaluation tasks considered in this paper are mainly classification/multiple choice selection tasks and require generating a single token. The paper does not clearly articulate the adaptability of the proposed method to more complex tasks, such as summarization, translation, or coding, which necessitate the auto-regressive generation of longer sequences. It would be beneficial to explore and elucidate how the experts and routers operate in such long-seq generation scenarios.

### Questions
The authors show that token routing performs better than sentence routing across various model sizes. An alternative input to the router could be the representation derived from the last encoder layer of T5. How does this encoded representation perform in comparison? This could also offer considerable computational advantages, particularly in situations involving a large number of experts, as it would allow for the pre-computation of the weighted average of experts immediately following the generation of the encoder representation. On the other hand, it would be interesting to see if adding or concatenating the encoder's representation to the representation of tokens further improve performance.

### Summary
The paper addresses how to leverage MoEs for instruction fine-tuning and presents MoV and MoLORA. The use of MoE in fine-tuning leverages the fact that conditional computation is efficient while avoiding the disadvantage that MoE requires relatively large storage by combining MoE with (IA)^3 and LoRa. In-depth experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results with full fine-tuning, only 1% of the parameters involved, and no limitation to the model scale, and can also adapt the model to unseen tasks.

### Strengths
1.	Leverage the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of the MoE structure when combined with PEFT methods.
2.	In-depth ablation study demonstrates the capabilities and scalabilities of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1.	MoE takes advantage of the inherent heterogeneity of the data, allowing different parameters to handle different distributions in the data. However, fine-tuning usually focuses on one or a few downstream tasks. In this case, the motivation for using ten or even dozens of experts for learning requires further justification.
2.	LoRa exploits the inherent low-rank properties of large models. However, multiple parallel LoRa matrices are mathematically equivalent to higher rank LoRa. The effectiveness of MoLoRa proposed in this article cannot be proven without comparison with higher-rank lora.

### Questions
The article mentioned that the larger the batch size, the easier it is for MoE to collapse to an expert. However, the difference between fine-tuning and pretrain is that the model has entered a relatively stable and better-performing landscape before training begins. Why under such conditions, the more common gradient direction brought by a larger batchsize will still cause a certain expert to dominate the gradient descent direction of the parameter space?
