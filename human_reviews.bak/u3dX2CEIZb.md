## Abstract
Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an ``expert'' through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.

### Summary
This work aims to reduce the cost of imposing hard physical constraints in deep neural network training by utilizing Mixture-of-Experts. The proposed approach is scalable and allows multi-GPU training. The improved stability and efficiency of the proposed method over existing approaches are well demonstrated on non-linear systems.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is overall well written.

(2) The problem addressed in this paper, which is how to impose physical constraints into large-scale deep neural network training, is of importance.

(3) The improvement of the proposed method over baselines is significant.

### Weaknesses
Major: As claimed by the authors in the last paragraph in page 4, the utilizing of Mixture-of-Experts is motivated by two reasons/challenges. (A) In complicated systems, compared with global physical constraints, local constraints are more manageable. (B) The scalability of the non-linear least squares solver impeded the increase in the number of sample points (m), thereby affecting the accuracy of predictions. 

Reason A aligns with the phenomenon we have observed in language tasks [1]: data from different domains can interfere with each other and hinder training. However, the authors did not provide evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon in dynamic systems, nor did they demonstrate that the improvement of the PI-HC-MoE over PI-HC is due to avoiding such interference. One possible experiment to demonstrate the latter is to randomly assign data points to experts and compare it to the allocation based on spatio-temporal coordinates.

Challenge B can be overcome by utilizing MoE. However, a more straightforward solution will be employing scalable non-linear least squares solvers, e.g. [2][3]. The authors didn’t comment on this line of works. If there are suitable solvers available, I would like to see a comparison between PI-HC and PI-HC-MoE with the same number of data points.

Furthermore, the performance of the baseline appears to be inconsistent with the results reported in [4], e.g., 1D non-linear diffusion-sorption equation results, see [4], Appendix E.

Minor: There are several errors and confusions in the use of mathematical symbols in the text, including but not limited to 
(1) in section 3, first paragraph, line 1, $0$ should be in bold.
(2) in section 3, first paragraph, line 4, the definition of $\mathcal{G}$ and in the second paragraph, line 4, the definition of $f_{\theta}$, other notation should be used to denote the spaces of $\phi$, $u_\theta$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
(3) In section 3, second paragraph, line 5, $f^i: \phi \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ should be $f^i: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
(4) In section 3, second paragraph, third to last line, $f_\theta(\phi(x))$ should be $f_\theta(\phi)(x)$.
(5) In page 4, two lines above Property (1), the definition of $S_{\mathbf{b}}$ and $S_\omega$.

Similar errors are repeated throughout the paper and should be corrected.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new method to apply strict physical rules in mixture-of-experts (MoE) for intricate dynamic systems. The authors believe that when training neural networks, using well-known physical rules, like conservation laws, can enhance results and speed up learning processes. But, there's a drawback: this method can take up a lot of computing power and storage, especially with big systems.

To solve this, the authors suggest using MoE. Here, the data is split into sections, with each section having an "expert" to apply the rules. Every expert works on a specific part of the data, and a special network decides how much importance to give each expert's output. This method saves on computing power and storage but still gives accurate results.

They test their method on various physical problems, such as fluid movement and quantum mechanics. They compare their results with other top methods and find their method is just as good, if not better, and uses less resources. Plus, it can handle big systems. In conclusion, the paper offers a fresh and effective way to use MoE to apply strict physical rules, which could make neural networks better and faster at solving complex systems.

### Strengths
1. Novel approach: The paper presents a novel approach to enforcing hard physical constraints using a mixture of experts (MoE) that significantly reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining accuracy and convergence guarantees.

2. Scalability: The authors demonstrate that their approach scales well to large-scale systems, making it suitable for complex dynamical systems.

3. Comparative analysis: The paper provides a detailed comparative analysis of their approach with other state-of-the-art approaches, showing that it achieves comparable or better performance while being significantly more efficient.

4. Real-world applications: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several physical problems, including fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and quantum mechanics, showing that it has real-world applications.

5. Clear presentation: The paper is well-written and clearly presents the approach, methodology, and results, making it easy to understand and follow.

### Weaknesses
While the paper presents a novel and scalable approach to enforcing hard physical constraints using mixture-of-experts (MoE), there are some potential weaknesses that should be considered. 

Firstly, the paper lacks empirical evaluation of the approach on a wider range of physical problems. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several physical problems, including fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and quantum mechanics, it would have been beneficial to have more empirical evaluation of the approach on a wider range of physical problems. This would have helped to better understand the generalizability and limitations of the approach.

Secondly, the paper does not provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the approach. While the authors provide a detailed description of the approach, they do not provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the method. This could have helped to better understand the underlying principles and assumptions of the method, and to provide a more solid foundation for future research.

Thirdly, the paper does not discuss the limitations of the approach. While the authors discuss the advantages of their approach, they do not discuss the limitations of the method. For example, the assumptions made about the physical system or the potential impact of the choice of experts on the overall performance. This could limit the ability of readers to fully understand the applicability and limitations of the approach.

### Questions
What are the benefits of imposing known physical constraints during neural network training?

How does the MoE approach differ from standard differentiable optimization in enforcing hard physical constraints?

Can you provide an example of a complex dynamical system where this scalable approach would be particularly useful?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel Physics Informed (PI) framework to scale the imposition of "Hard Constraints" (HC) with the use of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Network. The hard constraints are imposed on $m$ sampled points $x_1, ..., x_m \in \Omega$ by solving a non-linear least squares problem (NLSS), and the optimization is made possible by using a differentiable solver. The paper proposes a framework that decomposes the domain $\Omega$ into subdomains $\Omega_k$ before solving the NLSS problem on each subdomain.

They tested the framework as a neural PDE solver on 1D diffusion-sorption and turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a data-constrained regime. The method outperforms existing soft and hard-constrained methods in terms of accuracy, and scales well at inference w.r.t the number of sampled points.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and easy to follow. The method takes inspiration from the domain decomposition which is standard in the the literature for solving Partial Differential Equations.
I appreciated the details in the Methods section, particularly the explanations on the forward and backward pass of the architecture.
The method clearly outperforms the existing  soft- and hard-constrained baselines. The claim of the paper to the scaling is well supported with a solid inference time analysis.

### Weaknesses
Unless I am mistaken, there is no clear formulation of the output function $u(x, t)$ at inference except in Figure 1, and if I understand the figure correctly, then $u(x, t) = \sum_k b(x,t)^T w_k =b(x,t)^T( \sum_k w_k)$. In this case, the sum of $w_k$ is the weights used to query the function over the domain $\Omega$, and  as $w \neq w_k$ a priori, we do not know if the constraints are hardly imposed on any sampled points. Therefore, at inference I do not think that the PDE can be constrained in a hard setting with this architecture.

I also assume that solving an equation on a domain $\Omega$ with boundaries $\delta \Omega$ is not always equivalent to solving the equation separately on different subdomains and that precautions must be taken. There is no mathematical derivation of the domain decomposition problem, and therefore we do not know if the solution found with the subdomains is close enough to that of the solution on the full problem. 

I also understood from Figure 1 that the different domains were not overlapping and represented "chunks" of the domain, but I am puzzled by the grid artifacts of the method in Figure 3. The solution seems to showcase some strange aliasing which would suggest overlapping domains.

### Questions
Could you explain the artifacts of the method in Figure 3 ?

Did you explore the aspect of each basis function ? What do they learn ? Do the different weights overlap over the domains or are some weights "activated" only on specific subdomains  ? 

Did you check the PDE residuals on the sampled points to the see if the constraint was respected ?

Could you provide more explanations on the way to compute $\frac{\partial z^*}{\partial \theta}$ ?

### Summary
Methods
- This paper utilizes the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) as the NN architecture to learn a set of N scalar-valued functions as the basis functions; enforces the hard constraints by using differentiable optimization to find a linear combination of basis functions to satisfy the constraints.
- To deal with larger systems which contain a large number of sampled points and basis functions, mixture-of-experts is used to decompose the spatialtemporal domain.
- In backward pass, to compute the gradients of the differentiable optimization, the implicit function theorem is used. For mixture-of-experts, the Jacobian is reconstructed from the individual Jacobians from all experts. 

Experiments:
- Two cases: 1D diffusion-sorption and 2D turbulent Navier-Stokes 
- Compared to training via a physics-informed soft constraint (PI-SC) and physics-informed hard constraint (PI-HC). 
    - Achieve higher accuracy and lower time cost.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a new way to decompose the complex dynamical systems with a large number of points in the spatiotemporal domain to smaller solvable systems, by utilizing the mixture-of-experts method. It makes the system scalable and performant (with parallel computing).
- In the 2 test cases provided in the paper, the paper’s method has higher accuracy and lower time cost compared with other two methods.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are relatively limited - the paper only tests on 2 cases, one for 1D and another for 2D. In each experiment, only one set of environment parameters (e.g.,, only Reynolds number = 1e4 is used for the Navier-Stokes case) are tested.

### Questions
- What are the temporal intervals used for generating the training data and for testing the model? 
    - In the 2D case, “Both the training and test sets have a trajectory length of T = 5 seconds.“. But it’s not clear for the 1D case. 
- How does the model's performance extend to temporal domain outside the training dataset? For example, if we generate the training data within the time frame of [0 seconds, 10 seconds], how well does the trained model predict the system in the interval of [10s, 20] compared with predict the interval of [0s, 10s]? And how about the spatial domain outside the training dataset?
- The paper only gives examples in 1D and 2D, what are the potential risks of using the proposed model for predicting 3D systems? Alternatively, can it be seamlessly adapted for 3D applications?

### Summary
This paper proposes a scalable way to enforce hard constraints expressed as partial differential equations into neural networks in order to faithfully model physical phenomena. The problem they try to tackle is given by the fact that backpropagating through constraints over large meshes is a highly non-linear problem that grows in dimensionality with respect to the mesh and neural network size. The authors propose to impose the constraints over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an expert.

### Strengths
**Novelty:**

I am not in a position to judge the novelty of the paper as there is very little overlap with my work. From the related work mentioned in the paper, the paper seems novel. 


**Significance:**

The paper is of high interest to a subset of the ML community.

### Weaknesses
**Clarity:** 
 
The paper is mostly quite clear. Personally, I would have benefitted from an ongoing example, where it is made clear what the outputs of the neural networks are, what the constraints are, and how the problem is divided in that case. Even better, it would have been nice to use the same example to move from one constraint to multiple ones.

### Questions
**Experimental Analysis:**

The experimental analysis seems quite comprehensive. My main question is: are PI-SC and PI-HC the only models against which you can compare? 

Also, the authors compare the execution time of PI-HC vs PI-HC-MoE, what about PI-SC?

I am not sure I understand the scales in Figure 3. If the row below represents the difference between the predictions made by the NN and the prediction made by the numerical solver, how is it possible to have a scale between -3 and 3? 

The authors compare their method against PI-HC and PI-SC in terms of computation time, what about space? Is the memory requirement of PI-SC-MoE also advantageous and/or comparable?
