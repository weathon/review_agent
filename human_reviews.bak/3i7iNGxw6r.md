# Where Does In-context Machine Translation Happen in Large Language Models?

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Self-supervised large language models have demonstrated the ability to perform Machine Translation (MT) via in-context learning, but little is known about where the model performs MT with respect to prompt instructions and demonstration examples.
In this work, we attempt to characterize the region in layer-wise attention heads where GPT models transition from in-context learners to translation models. Through a series of layer-wise context-masking experiments on GPTNeo2.7B and Bloom3B, we demonstrate evidence of a "task recognition" point where the translation task is encoded into the input representations and attention to context is no longer necessary. Our layer-wise fine-tuning experiments indicate that the most effective layers for MT fine-tuning are the layers critical to task recognition. Next, we examine redundancy in layers following task recognition, observing that masking these later layers  does not hurt performance significantly. Finally, we train discrete attention head gates with $L_0$ regularisation and find evidence that the most pruneable heads occur after task recognition.

### Summary
While large language models (LLMs) show in-context learning capability, our understanding is still quite limited. This paper explores where the in-context ability occurs in LLMs with machine translation as the testbed. The authors adopt a layer-wise context-masking method on GPTNeo and Bloom, discovering a "task-recognition" point in LLMs beyond which attending to the context is less significant. Further analysis reveals that finetuning layers around such a point are most effective and that layers after this point show higher redundancy.

### Strengths
1) The analysis in this paper is intuitive and easy to follow, and is based on two different language models;
2) The findings are very interesting, which show some insights about how the in-context capability evolves in LLMs and may benefit works on inference efficiency and sparsity modeling;

### Weaknesses
Experiments are limited to a few language pairs and LLMs of one size, making the generality of the findings questionable.

### Questions
While the findings are interesting, I have concerns about how generalizable they are. 

Firstly, the authors picked En<->Fr as the translation task, but En<->Fr is often regarded as a relatively easy task due to high language similarity and minimal reorderings. It would be great to have experiments on other languages as well, such as En<->De.

Secondly, the findings are only based on LLMs of one size, i.e. 3B. It's unclear whether readers could expect similar findings on other model sizes.

Besides, based on Figure 1, retaining access to instructions pushes the task-recognition point to earlier layers. Does this also apply to prompt examples? For example, 5-shot prompting often outperforms 1-shot prompting. Can we get an early task recognition point by retaining access to 1 prompt example? If so, we might retain the 5-shot prompting performance but only attend to 1 example for most layers, indicating a high inference efficiency.

Lastly, the statement "the most prunable heads occur after task recognition" might be inadequate. In Figure 5, the head distribution for BLOOM is quite random.


==== After Author Response
Thanks for the response and new experimental results. It seems that the findings could generalize to other language pairs and models to some extent, though the pattern in LLama shows some differences. I tend to keep my positive score.

### Summary
The paper provides insightful findings that GPT models locate, or learn, the translation task at a specific layer during in-context learning. This paper seems extremely interesting to read but the presentation is hard to follow. The set-up is a bit not optimal to me. Meanwhile some finding is not that ``solid". I am happy to consider reading it again and adjust my score if the authors revise the paper to make it easier to follow, plus answering several questions I asked below.

### Strengths
* The paper provides insightful findings that GPT models locate, or learn, the translation task at a specific layer during in-context learning. I found the very fascinating and want to learn more about them.

### Weaknesses
While I like the work, I don't think it is at the bar of ICLR at the moment. I wanted to point out 3 biggest weaknesses to me - the presentation, the set-up and the conclusion.

* The biggest weakness of the paper to me is that the presentation. I was very excited to read the work but later on I realize it is not that easy to follow the paper at all. I think the difficulty in following the work lies in several parts, to name a few as follows. First, the notations of −, ◦, • as well as Instr−Ex− are somewhat hard to follow and remember to me. I often have to go back and forth to understand this more. Second, there are difficult sentences/paragraphs (examples as below that I could not follow well). Third, I totally get lost at Figure 3 (what are instr_L1L2? what are instr_none?). Fourth, I have an issue with the section of 4.2, while this is nice "Using the example of GPTNeo (32 layers), with a prompt size of 10, and lr = 20, the savings are approximately 35%.", there is no detailed comparison of translation accuracy at all.


* Context masking before a certain level of task- recognition results in a translation model that is often worse than the baseline which sees no instructions or examples. -> I have an issue with this sentence and I always want to take this chance to talk about my concern for the set-up. I consider this is not a surprising fact at all given that the prompt and translation examples appear BEFORE the input. Because of that masking them would obviously distort the representation of the input anyway. It maybe odd but I think the best set-up experiment for this is as follows:
Translate this input: input from english to french, given the following translation examples: ....
I think with this set-up, masking the prompt (from english to french, given the following translation examples: ) and the examples (....) will NOT make that much impact to the translation.

*"Contrary to common fine-tuning wisdom, we show that fine-tuning of model layers is most beneficial in layers associated with task recognition, i.e. the middle layers of the model." -> I found this argument is very weak. The paper already mentions that "Note that this setup is designed to tune the layers for task location. It is highly unlikely that the model can learn translation knowledge from this small amount of supervision", so we cannot take results from such a set-up to say the above finding is correct.


Other notes:
* Interestingly, there is a strong inter-dependency amongst a sequence of layers, where masking out the context results in very poor task recognition. -> I really get lost at this sentence

* Finally, we see that when instructions are masked with the examples (Instr•Ex•), model behavior closely follows that of models which do not receive instructions in their context at all (Instr−Ex•), suggesting that instructions are largely ignored when the examples are present. However, if the model is given complete access to instructions (Instr◦Ex•), it can use the intermediate processing of examples to achieve "task recognition" earlier. -> Somehow this paragraph is also not clear to me.

### Questions
* For the analysis in section 4, I understand that the prompt is "Translate English to French." I wonder the case where we change the prompt, e.g. something as follows: "Below are different examples for the translation of English to French. Use them and translate the following input". In the case of different prompt, I was wondering if the specific layer where the plateaus appears (e.g. 20 for GPTNEO, 25 for BLOOM) will change?
* Please elaborate more on Figure 3 about instr_none, intrst_l1l2

### Summary
The paper studies in-context learning of MT tasks in LLMs, with a view towards identifying where (at which layers) in-context MT occurs in GPT-style LLMs and characterizing the extent to which layers are redundant for the task in question.  Using GPTNEO2.7Band Bloom 3B for en <-> fr translation on FLORES, the authors explore combinations of instruction prompts and in-context examples and analyze model behavior by layer-from context masking. The authors find that 'task recognition' occurs in middle layers and that masking context earlier significantly disrupts model performance and access to instructions can encourage earlier task recognition. One implication is that increased efficiency can be achieved by masking context (avoiding computational overhead) starting at a certain layer. Additionally, LoRA fine-tuning applied to different layers showed that fine-tuning earlier-to-middle layers is more important than fine-tuning later layers.  The authors then apply the same masking strategy to attention heads, with inconclusive results.

### Strengths
The paper succeeds in shedding more light on the phenomenon of in-context learning for MT, specifically the importance of specific layers. Results are intuitively plausible though not entirely surprising. The interpretation of early-to-middle task recognition layers is supported by multiple series of experiments. The methodology used could be applied to other NLP tasks, and implications regarding efficient inference and design of fine-tuning strategies should be of broad interest.

### Weaknesses
The paper could have been strengthened by evaluating on more MT tasks, including different language pairs (e.g. high-resource and low-resource pairs) and different complexity (e.g., sentence-level vs. document-level translation). 
The section on the importance of attention heads seems fairly preliminary as conclusions differ for the two models investigated. Rather than the model architecture, the training strategy or training data set may play a role here as well (e.g., instruction tuning), there should be a more in-depth discussion of this. 
With respect to importance of attention heads for in-context learning, the study by Bansal et al 2022 (arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.09095) may be relevant here.

### Questions
1. Do you have any interpretation of the zig-zagging of the green curve in Fig. 1 for  GPTNeo prior to reaching stability?

### Summary
The paper is an study of where does the "in-context" Machine translation happens on LLMs. 
With that goal in mind,  authors analyze 0-shot and few-shot prompts with and without instructions.
Then they perform several ablation studies to understand when the models generate a task embedding from where there is no degradation.
This is done in several ways: 
* masking the context and/or the few-shot examples form one layer onward
* masking the full attention on some layers
* masking attention in all tokens 
* studying the sparseness pattern of attention heads via L0 reg ft
* some LORA finetunning. 

They try to models GPTNeo and BLoom.

### Strengths
They tackle a very difficult and challenging problem and attempt to decipher some conclusions out of the process.
They methodically run experiments with 2 models to attempt to obtain generality. 
Their findings are interesting. 
The paper is well written and mostly understandable.

### Weaknesses
The paper exhibits certain limitations in its experimental approach, which consequently restrict the breadth of its conclusions. The exclusive reliance on the en-fr language pair raises concerns about potential biases. It remains unclear if the observed behavior would persist in en-sp or en-zh pairs or in direct transitions like fr-ge. By analyzing only two LLMs, both with a similar scale of 2.7B and 3B, the conclusions' applicability gets limited as well. This limitation becomes especially pertinent given that other studies, as acknowledged by the authors, like Wei et al. (2023) who suggest that In-Context Learning (ICL) procedure may be model size-dependent.

The paper's predominant focus on the attention mechanism during its ablation study might inadvertently introduce alternative explanations for task embedding, such as the potential for it to merely represent a semantic compression of input tokens. It is not clear which is the alternative research hypotheses to the task vector explanation and the found layer-wise behaviour. 
For instance, one could have used a misleading instruction like 'write a summary in French', or 'plan how to solve the enumerated task in English'; or used several alternative instructions to perform the translation task, e.g. "how can I say  '{{sentence}}' in French ?", "what is the English translation of "{{sentence}}" ? , ... etc. 

While Figure 1 and Figure 2 seem to display congruent patterns, it's challenging to reconcile them with Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3, in particular, is ambiguous;  the legend terms, like 'instr_L1L2' and 'instr_none', are not clearly defined. Similarly, the patterns oscillate and it is difficult to grasp conclusions w/o another task baseline finetuning.  Figure 4's alignment with the study's conclusions is also complicated due to the presence of layers exhibiting unexpected behavior. the main difference with Figure 1 is that  attention is limited to all other tokens, including the partial decoding and the input to translate. Maybe another interesting experiment is to mask attention from all input (not only instructions and examples), this could help understand this picture better or at least it will help to get a better hypotheses of why masking some initial layers. It might be that the task layers are simply compressing the input similarly to an encoder-decoder architecture and then the upper layers are simply decoding for which incrementally refining the hypotheses can provide limited gains. 

Regarding  the L0 regularization optimization, there might be several masks that can lead to similar solutions with different patterns. It would have been nice to see what happens if one biases the L0 masking loss towards both the "task identification layers" and the non-relevant layers. This modification would have been a stronger evidence towards the conclusion. 

Additionally, conducting analogous experiments in other domains, such as summarization, would undoubtedly offer a more comprehensive perspective specially for figure 1 and figure 2. 

Lastly, the use of "Instr-Ex*" nomenclature was frequently perplexing, especially when it often seems synonymous or expandable in the same manner as 'instr_L1L2'.

### Questions
Following the week points of the paper: 
* do the findings generalize to other languages ?
* should we expect similar behaviour on larger LLMs ?
* can the transition of layer mechanism be understood as "encoder"-like compression and "decoder"-like refinement ? 
* Would different instructions to achieve translation generate different pictures ? 
* how relevant are the specific examples selected in few-shot example ? 
* would other tasks behave similarly ? 
* where are inputs stop being used ? What is the missing plot between Fig 1 and Fig 4 -- if that included all layers above a given layer --
* are the L0 masks unique ? can we bias them against our conclusion and still mask 30 % of the heads ?
