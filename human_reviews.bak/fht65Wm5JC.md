- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Dueling bandits are widely used to model preferential feedback prevalent in many applications such as recommendation systems and ranking. 
   In this paper, we study the Borda regret minimization problem for dueling bandits, which aims to identify the item with the highest Borda score while minimizing the cumulative regret.
    We propose a rich class of generalized linear dueling bandit models, which cover many existing models.
    We first prove a regret lower bound of order $\Omega(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$ for the Borda regret minimization problem, where $d$ is the dimension of contextual vectors and $T$ is the time horizon.
    To attain this lower bound, we propose an explore-then-commit type algorithm for the stochastic setting, which has a nearly matching regret upper bound $\tilde{O}(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$. 
    We also propose an EXP3-type algorithm for the adversarial setting, where the underlying model parameter can change at each round. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde{O}(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$ regret, which is also optimal.
    Empirical evaluations on both synthetic data and a simulated real-world environment are conducted to corroborate our theoretical analysis.

### Summary
In this work, the authors consider the problem of linear dueling bandits, both in the stochastic and the adversarial setting. Dueling bandits is a variant of the standard multi-armed bandits problem, particularly well suited for practical applications, where at each round the algorithm selects two arms (also called items) to play and receives receives feedback that expresses which of the two items was preferred, As this preferences don't necessarily imply the existence of a unique ranking between the arms, the authors of the papers consider the Borda score (which is the average win rate against all arms) as the measure used to define the regret.
The goal of this work is to take advantage of the side information given by the linear bandit structure to learn faster. 

The first contribution of the paper is a well detailed lower bound proof, which shows that the difficulty of the problem scales as $d^{2/3}T^{2/3}$, where $T$  is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the contextual vectors.
They then present a simple Explore then commit strategy that achieves near optimal performance for the stochastic version of the problem, and a variation of the EXP3 algorithm that also achieves near optimal (and optimal rate when the number of arms is of order $2^d$). 
Finally, they present experiments on both generated and real world datasets showing that the presented algorithms can successfully use the linear structure of the problem to outperform the all the baselines.

### Strengths
This paper considers a new variation of the linear dueling bandits problem using Borda regret and provide very complete results. Specifically, the most important result presented in this paper is the lower bound, which is well detailed.

This first result is crucial to justify that the proposed algorithms, that shine by their simplicity, are sufficient for the problem at hand. I find the dual explore structure of the ETC algorithm fairly interesting: in the first part, the exploration is uniform to initialize correctly the algorithm, but then the exploration is refined to be tuned according to the precision required for each pairs of arms. The authors derive near optimal high probability bounds for this algorithm, which are stronger guarantees compared to results holding in expectation.

The second algorithm builds upon the very standard EXP3 algorithm, and its DEXP3 variant for dueling bandits. This algorithm is more robust, as it holds for the adversarial version of the problem, which is more challenging. Interestingly, the proposed bound is actually tight when the number of arms is exponential in the dimension of the contextual vector, and in the experiments, BEXP3 outperforms its ETC counterpart.

It is also appreciated that the authors discuss how to modify the algorithms to adapt for small number of arms as well as infinite number of arm, and it is worth noting that the paper is particularly well written, with details like ensuring that all notations are clearly defined and visual representations of the lower bound.

### Weaknesses
This work seems very solid overall.

One limitation that seems perhaps unnecessary is the fact that the time horizon has to be known. It would be nice for the authors to discuss which approaches (such as a doubling trick) could be used to remove this limitation, which would make these algorithms even easier to use in practice. (For the EXP3 algorithm, it is now standard to use a time varying learning rate for more applications).

In the experiments section, it would be nice to see more experiments that compare the two presented algorithms with different number of arms and time horizons: Will the ETC algorithm always have larger regret than the BEXP3 one due to the cost of the exploration phase or are there problem settings in which the ETC algorithm is better? as the BEXP3 algorithm is more robust and performs better in the experiments, I wonder if there is any case where one would prefer the ETC algorithm?

### Questions
Besides for the original version of the EXP3 algorithm (Auer et al. 2002), it is more common to find this algorithm stated with the use of losses rather than rewards, as it is not necessary to include extra exploration. Have you considered converting these rewards into losses and relying on EXP3 with losses (and possibly with time dependent leaning rate?)

(as stated in the weaknesses:) Will the ETC algorithm always have larger regret than the BEXP3 one due to the cost of the exploration phase or are there problem settings in which the ETC algorithm is better? as the BEXP3 algorithm is more robust and performs better in the experiments, I wonder if there is any case where one would prefer the ETC algorithm?

### Summary
This paper delves into the realm of generalized linear dueling bandits within a stochastic setting and linear bandits within an adversarial setting. The scenario involves K arms with fixed features, and at each time step, the agent selects a pair of items (i_t, j_t), receiving stochastic feedback indicating whether i_t is preferred over item j_t. The probability model adopted encompasses a generalized linear model with an unknown parameter $\theta^*\in\mathbb{R}^d$ for the stochastic setting and linear model with $\theta_t$ for the adversarial setting. Regret is assessed through the Borda score, defined as the average winning probability of an arm over the other arms.

The authors establish a lower bound for both the stochastic and adversarial settings. For the stochastic setting, they introduce an algorithm based on ETC, tightly matching the lower bound concerning T and d. In the adversarial setting, they propose the BEXP3 algorithm based on EXP3, achieving regret of (dlog K)^{1/3}T^{2/3}. The paper concludes with a demonstration of the proposed algorithms using synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
The authors explore generalized linear dueling bandits with Borda scores, conducting an analysis of regret lower bounds and presenting algorithms for both stochastic and adversarial settings with upper bounds on regret.

### Weaknesses
-The authors assert that previous work by Saha (2021) on linear contextual duel bandits can be considered a special case of their model. However, the cited work involves a contextual set of arms that may change over time and a more generalized Multi-nomial logistic model, in contrast to the fixed feature vectors and dueling bandits considered in this study. Notably, the previously proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\sqrt{T}$, while the algorithm presented in this work achieves a $T^{2/3}$ regret bound.

-As acknowledged by the authors, Saha (2021a) addressed adversarial duel bandits. While this present study introduces a linear model for the adversarial case, the extension to a linear model appears to follow the adversarial linear bandit algorithm outlined in "Bandit Algorithms" by Lattimore and Szepesvari and D-EXP3 [Saha 2021a]. There is a concern regarding whether there are discernible factors indicating that this extension is not a trivial one.

### Questions
-As indicated in the Weakness section, what accounts for the fact that the previously proposed algorithm in [Saha 2021] attains a regret bound of $\sqrt{T}$—which appears to be superior to the results presented in this work, specifically $T^{2/3}$ in both lower and upper bounds?

-Regarding Theorem 4.1, what constitutes the primary technical challenge in analyzing the lower bound for the linear bandit model compared to the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) scenario discussed in [Saha 2021a]?

### Summary
The paper studies generalized linear dueling bandits with the goal of tracking the Borda winner and minimizing Borda regret. They have matching upper and lower gap-free regret bounds in the stochastic setting and a regret upper bound in the adversarial setting.

While I believe the proofs are technically correct, I think the results are not surprising and so the novelty is limited. Overall, this paper seems to mostly combine two well-known theories in a straightforward application: (1) that of Borda regret minimization in dueling bandits (especially calling on the results of Saha et al., 2021) and (2) known techniques for generalized linear bandits (e.g., Li et al. 2017). Plese see "Weaknesses" below for specific discussions.

### Strengths
* I appreciate the honest and consistent references to prior works to help understand where the proof strategies were borrowed.
* The proofs and constructions are generally easy to follow, and the paper is overall well-written.
* There are also experiments to support the theoretical findings.
* The paper is the first to study generalized linear dueling bandits with Borda objective, to my knowledge. So, the results are not subsumed by any prior works. 
* In particular, the first lower bounds are shown for this settin and a matching minimax upper bound is shown.

### Weaknesses
* I am curious why the authors pursued the Borda setting over the more established Condorcet setting where one targets a Condorcet winner and minimizes Condorcet regret. It is somewhat debatable in the literature which setting is preferable. In my opinion, since the Borda setting relies on pure exploration tactics (e.g., explore-then-commit in stochastic setting or EXP3 with T^{-1/3} exploration in adversarial setting), it is very amenable to the generalizing to this GLM model without hassle. Thus, I think the regret upper bounds in this paper are not surprising. The stochastic BETC-GLM regret bound seems to follow almost immediately from well-known sample complexity bounds for optimal design, where estimation of $\theta^*$ is completely decoupled from regret. Meanwhile, the adversarial regret bound for BEXP3 seems to be identical to that of DEXP3 in Saha et al., 2021 except for plugging in slightly different variance bounds at the end. 
To contrast, in the Condorcet setting, where pure exploration is innapropriate to target $\sqrt{T}$ reget, one would have had to carefully decouple estimation of $\theta^*$ and regret minimization. So, I think the Condorcet setting would have been more technically interesting to study.
* Alternatively, it would have been more interesting to study instance-dependent regret rates (e.g., those appearing in Jamieson et al., 2015) as it's more unclear to me how those would behave for GLM dueling bandits.
* The adversarial regret upper bound seems to only be able to get the $(d\log(K))^{1/3}$ dependence and not the $d^{2/3}$ dependence if $K \gg 2^d$ because there is an unavoidable $\log(K)$ appearing in the EXP3 analysis. Therefore, it is not necessarily optimal in all regimes. 
* As is the case for generalized linear MAB, there is a mysterious dependence on $\kappa^{-1}$ in the regret upper bounds. It is unclear to me if this dependence is optimal and calls into question how realistic this regret bound can be.

### Questions
# Questions
* As mentioned above, can the adverserial dueling bandit analysis be improved to $d^{2/3} T^{2/3}$ for very large $K$?
* Can the authors comment on the dependence in the regret of $\kappa^{-1}$ in the regret and whether it is optimal or realistic for common link functions?
* It seems like BEXP3 seems to perform the best in your experiments. This seems a little confusing to me because the constructed environments seem to be stochastic and not adversarial. Can the authors comment on this?

# Writing Notes
* The term "contextual vector" or "contextual dueling bandit" is used many times to refer to the feature ${\bf x}_i$ of arm $i$. This can be easily confused with contextual bandits where one observed a context $X_t$ independent of the arms, and so some clarification in the language might be helpful.

### Summary
The authors prove a regret lower and upper bounds for the Borda regret minimization problem for generalized linear models with K arms, which largely depend polynomial on d is the dimension of the contextual vectors and T is the time horizon. Specifically, they achieve matching upper and lower bounds of d^{2/3}T^{2/3} for the stochastic setting, as well as a d^{1/3}T^{2/3} upper bound in the adversarial setting.

### Strengths
The authors extend the previous works by allowing the regret bound to not inherently depend the number of arms K (generally log(K)); rather it depends on the inherent dimensionality of contextual vectors, which are given apriori. They study both the adversarial and stochastic settings, with generally similar conclusions. Furthermore, their lower bounds demonstrate that their upper bounds are in fact tight due to the dual-regret nature of Borda regret. Their lower bounds seem to imply that the preference information + regret structure makes Borda regret minimization inherently harder than typical bandit regret settings as note that the action pair with the highest reward does not lead to optimal minimization.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness is the novelty of the paper and it's derived bounds. It appears that the lower bounds use the standard hypercube + info theoretical argument from [Dani et al 08 or survey on bandits by Lattimore] and fails to clarify the novelty in their lower bounds from previous works. Furthermore, the upper bound uses a simple ETC algorithm and analysis and it is unclear how the novelty from the typical ETC analysis [see survey on bandits by Lattimore]. 

Furthermore, the paper mentions Borda regret in the adversarial setting but it becomes less obvious why Borda regret in this setting is even possible without assumptions 3.2 and 3.3 (it appears that Algorithm 2 does not use the structure of mu at ALL!). If that is indeed possible, why is there no reduction from adversarial to stochastic?

### Questions
In algorithm 2 (adversarial setting), where does mu show up? How can it work without inferring mu at all and without assumptions 3.2/3.3?

Can you explain the novelty in your lower/upper bounds in the stochastic setting?
