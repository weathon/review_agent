# AED: Adaptable Error Detection for Few-shot Imitation Policy

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
We study the behavior error detection of few-shot imitation (FSI) policies, which behave in novel (unseen) environments. FSI policies would provoke damage to surrounding people and objects when failing, restricting their contribution to real-world applications. We should have a robust system to notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. Thus, we formulate a novel problem: adaptable error detection (AED) for monitoring FSI policy behaviors. The problem involves the following three challenges: (1) detecting errors in novel environments, (2) no impulse signals when behavior errors occur, and (3) online detection lacking global temporal information. To tackle AED, we propose Pattern Observer (PrObe) to parse the discernable patterns in the policy feature representations of normal or error states. PrObe is then verified in our seven complex multi-stage FSI tasks. From the results, PrObe consistently surpasses strong baselines and demonstrates a robust capability to identify errors arising from a wide range of FSI policies. Finally, the visualizations of learned pattern representations support our claims and provide a better explainability of PrObe.

### Summary
This paper studies a novel problem: detecting behavior errors online in novel environments and name it adaptable error detection (AED). The problem setting comes with several challenges, including how to deal with unseen objects/backgrounds, subtle behavior differences between success and failure as well as detecting failure during policy execution. 

The authors propose to learn pattern flow in the policy’s representation space and design novel architectures, such as a pattern extractor to extract discriminative patterns of different rollouts. It also applies several novel training tricks: rollout augmentation and temporal-aware triplet loss to stabilize training.

Besides the contribution of a new method, this paper also designs new challenging FSI tasks to evaluate AED methods and baselines.

### Strengths
- Studies an interesting problem that is essential for the deployment of robotic learning systems in safety-critical settings. 
- The proposed method is novel and achieves superior performance compared to some error detection baselines.
- The designed tasks and paired environments (base and novel) will be beneficial for the community to study policy generalization and benchmark deployment performance.

### Weaknesses
- Baselines are not recent and strong enough for meaningful comparisons. All the baselines do not have access to the policy network while the proposed method utilizes it. There are a couple of recent works in error detection in robot manipulation, including MoMaRT [1], ThriftyDAgger [2], and some model-based approaches [3] worth comparing.

- Since both the policy and error detector are conditioned on demonstrations, it’s worth seeing the performance of the error detector under different demonstration qualities. When deploying a human-robot interactive system, we should be able to separate out human error and robot error.

- In the visualizations, the failure is detected after the fact (5 frames later), which is undesirable if the damage is already happened. This is expected as the design doesn’t include a world model to predict possible failures. I hope the authors can discuss this in more detail and point out the intended application of the proposed error detector.

### Questions
How does the method compare with recent papers, such as MoMaRT, ThrifyDAgger, etc.?

How does the PRAUC change with different demonstration qualities?

What’s the use case of the proposed system if it only detects failure after the fact?

### Summary
This work formulates the adaptable error detection (AED) problem for monitoring few-shot imitation (FSI) policy behaviors. The main goal is to have a robust system that can notify operators when FSI policies are inconsistent with the intent of demonstrations. To address the three challenges while achieving the main goal, this work proposes Pattern Observer (PrObe) parse the state patterns in policy feature representations. Experiments demonstrated that PrObe outperforms strong baselines in seven complex multi-stage FSI tasks.

### Strengths
1.	This work first emphasizes the importance of the adaptable error detection (AED) problem in few-shot imitation. Then, it indicates the previous error detection methods are infeasible in the three challenges of AED: (1) working in novel environments, (2) no impulse signal when errors occur, and (3) it requires online detection. 

2.	Pattern Observer (PrObe) is then proposed to address the three challenges in AED. They first compute the policy feature embeddings for the successful and failed rollout frames. Then, PrObe uses an extractor to parse patterns in the policy features. Next, PrObe leverages existing temporal information by computing the pattern flow over time. Finally, PrObe distinguishes the feature source by comparing the fusion of pattern flow and transformed task embeddings. 

3.	This work designed challenging multi-stage FSI tasks to validate PrObe’s effectiveness. The experiments demonstrated that PrObe outperforms baselines significantly.

### Weaknesses
1.	As discussed in related work, adaptable error detection (AED) is more challenging than few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD), and previous error detection methods are infeasible for AED. After reading the introduction, I understand that the main goal of AED is to monitor FSI policies and report their behavior errors. PrObe is proposed to address the challenges of AED. However, sections 4 and 5 are relatively not well connected to each other. If Figure 2 describes the whole framework of this paper, which part does PrObe contribute to? In AED training of AED inference? What is the relationship between equations (1) (2) and (3)?

### Questions
1.	Regarding the rollout augmentation (second paragraph of section 5.1), the authors iterate each frame from sampled agent rollouts and randomly apply the following operations: keep, drop, swap, and copy, with probability 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.2.  Is there any specific reason for choosing the four operations with the mentioned probabilities?

2.	If Figure 2 describes the whole framework of this paper, which part does PrObe contribute to? In AED training of AED inference? What is the relationship between equations (1) (2) and (3)?

### Summary
The paper proposes a problem called AED to monitor few-shot imitation (FSI) learning policies. It also proposes a solution for this problem called Probe that utilizes FSI policy features.

### Strengths
1. AED is a fairly novel problem
2. A variety of experiments across the newly created FSI tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. It is very hard to read the paper. The prose could use significant improvements. There are also too many abbreviations in the paper making it hard to follow the content. What does "No impulse signals in behavior errors" mean? The problem and its challenges itself are unclear.
2. The papers makes many claims without supporting evidence, e.g. "We emphasize that addressing AED is as critical as enhancing FSI policies’ performance". 
3. As far as I understand, the term "vFSAD" refers to OOD detection in time-series data which includes a large quantity of work that has not been compared with or even mentioned. Example: Kaur et al. "CODiT: Conformal Out-of-Distribution Detection in Time-Series Data." 
4. The related work subtitles of "Policy" and "Evaluation tasks" are not descriptive and seemingly unrelated to the actual content.
5. There is repeated, unnecessary emphasis on the importance of the task: "FSAD is an innovative research topic", "FSI is a framework worthy of attention".
6. The stated aim of the experiments is confusing -- do you aim to check if detection is useful or if detection works?
