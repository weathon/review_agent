## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{FROSTER}, an effective framework for open-vocabulary action recognition. The CLIP model has achieved remarkable success in a range of image-based tasks, benefiting from its strong generalization capability stemming from pretaining on massive image-text pairs. However, applying CLIP directly to the open-vocabulary action recognition task is challenging due to the absence of temporal information in CLIP's pretraining. Further, fine-tuning CLIP on action recognition datasets may lead to overfitting and hinder its generalizability, resulting in unsatisfactory results when dealing with unseen actions.
To address these issues, FROSTER employs a residual feature distillation approach to ensure that CLIP retains its generalization capability while effectively adapting to the action recognition task. Specifically, the residual feature distillation treats the frozen CLIP model as a teacher to maintain the generalizability exhibited by the original CLIP and supervises the feature learning for the extraction of video-specific features to bridge the gap between images and videos. Meanwhile, it uses a residual sub-network for feature distillation to reach a balance between the two distinct objectives of learning generalizable and video-specific features.
We extensively evaluate FROSTER on open-vocabulary action recognition benchmarks under both base-to-novel and cross-dataset settings.  FROSTER consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets across the board.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present FROSTER, a clip-centric approach tailored for open vocabulary action recognition. They propose a simple but effective residual feature distillation and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on five datasets in both base-to-novel and cross-dataset scenarios.

### Strengths
1. The proposed residual feature distillation is simple but effective. 

2. The proposed method achieves promising performance on five datasets under both cross-dataset and base-to-novel settings.

### Weaknesses
My major concerns are on the experimental part. 

1. The authors touch upon "Text rephrasing" in Sec. 4.2, yet there's an absence of any ablation study related to it.

2. In the caption of Table 1, the authors mentioned that 'The results of most of the other papers are taken from Open-VCLIP and
ViFi-CLIP.', where are the results for Open-VCLIP? From Table 2 and Table 3, if my understanding is correct, the reported results use the Open-VCLIP as the backbone. Hence, showcasing Open-VCLIP's results in Table 1 becomes critical to underscore the effectiveness of the suggested method.

3. It would be beneficial to incorporate columns for "encoder" and "pretrained dataset" within the table for clearer comprehension.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents a CLIP-based framework for open-vocabulary action recognition, which distills the CLIP features by treating it as a strong teacher.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. 

2. The proposed Residual Feature Distillation is interesting and inspiring and outperforms the previous methods by a large margin (As shown in Table 1 and 2).

### Weaknesses
1. It would be better to report the finetuned results on all datasets (including K-400) for a better comparison.

2. The performance gains compared to baseline methods (in Table 1 and 2) are indeed surprising, and it would be better to visualize the learned embeddings on both base and novel datasets to see the effects of RFD on feature learning.

### Questions
Please refer to the Weakness. In addition, I still have a few questions:

1. The results in Table 1 are a little bit confusing, as the "Top1 accuracy" is only 77.8 on base categories. It would be better to further clarify the training and evaluation protocol, and the number of clips/crops used.

2. As the paper employs rephrased action descriptions, instead of action names, it would be interesting to show the video-text retrieval results.

### Summary
This paper proposed FROSTER as an open-vocabulary action recognition framework. Due to the gap between image and video domains, it is difficult to fine-tune CLIP model on video datasets without hurting its generalization ability. To this end, FROSTER employs the knowledge distillation strategy by treating the frozen CLIP as a teacher. The proposed method is evaluated on both base-to-novel and cross-dataset settings, and achieves better accuracy than existing methods without knowledge distillation on all datasets.

### Strengths
1. This paper has a good motivation to explore how a good open-vocabulary classifier transfers CLIP to the video domain, which is clearly shown in Figure 1.
2. The experiment is conducted comprehensively on 5 popular video datasets in terms of different network architectures.
3. The proposed method is practically useful and should be not difficult to implement.
4. The authors promise to release the source code.

### Weaknesses
1. I have concerns on the novelty. Knowledge distillation on CLIP is not new in this field. The authors didn't discuss related references as follows. Besides, the authors almost follow the classic knowledge distillation framework except for residual feature distillation.
[a] CLIPPING: Distilling CLIP-Based Models with a Student Base for Video-Language Retrieval, CVPR 2023.
[b] Enabling Multimodal Generation on CLIP via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation, ACL 2022.
2. The authors didn't employ compact student model as in normal knowledge distillation. I am wondering if the performance is better if we use ViT-B/32 as teacher and ViT-B/16 as student.
3. In Fig. 1, why CLIP performs more stable on larger Kinetics dataset than HMDB51 or UCF101?
4. What is the contribution of text rephrasing in Section 4.2?

### Questions
Please see the weaknesses. The authors should clarify the difference from the previous knowledge distillation works and add the corresponding subsection in the related work.

### Summary
The paper addressed the problem of adapting image-based CLIP models to open vocabulary action recognition in videos. The starting point of this paper is an observation that adapting CLIP on a particular video dataset will likely reduce its performance on other distinct datasets. Based on this observation, the authors proposed a method that combines a variant of feature distillation (Residual Feature Distillation) with standard cross entropy loss for adapting CLIP to videos. The proposed method can be attached to existing adaptation methods, and demonstrated strong empirical results on public benchmarks.

### Strengths
* The paper addressed an important and trendy topic on adapting CLIP models for video recognition tasks. 

* The paper is fairly well written. Technical details are clearly described and easy to follow.

* The proposed method is well motivated, and offers a reasonable solution.

* The experiments are extensive. The results are solid.

### Weaknesses
My main concern lies in the technical innovation of the paper. The proposed feature distillation falls into the framework of knowledge distillation, which has been extensively explored for adapting pre-trained models. While I agree that many prior works are insufficient for the objective of this paper, there are a few very recent papers that share the key idea of using feature distillation to adapt CLIP models for video tasks (see e.g., [a]). With this prior work, the technical innovation of the paper seems a bit incremental.

### Questions
I am a bit confused by how the results were reported for the proposed method in Table 1. Sec 4.2 (implementation details) states that “Otherwise stated, we use VCLIP for conducting experiments.” Is the proposed method (FROSTER) also built on VCLIP in Table 1? If so, VCLIP should be included as a baseline here. If not, a description should be included.
