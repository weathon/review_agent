- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
Factor analysis (FA) is a statistical tool for studying how observed variables with some mutual dependences can be expressed as functions of mutually independent unobserved factors, and it is widely applied throughout the psychological, biological, and physical sciences.  We revisit this classic method from the comparatively new perspective given by advancements in causal discovery and deep learning, introducing a framework for Neuro-Causal Factor Analysis (NCFA).  Our approach is fully nonparametric: it identifies factors via latent causal discovery methods and then uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) that is constrained to abide by the Markov factorization of the distribution with respect to the learned graph.  We evaluate NCFA on real and synthetic data sets, finding that it performs comparably to standard VAEs on data reconstruction tasks but with the advantages of sparser architecture, lower model complexity, and causal interpretability.  Unlike traditional FA methods, our proposed NCFA method allows learning and reasoning about the latent factors underlying observed data from a justifiably causal perspective, even when the relations between factors and measurements are highly nonlinear.

### Summary
The authors proposed Neuro-Causal Factor Analysis (NCFA) method, which is a nonparametric approach for modeling latent causal factors in deep generative models. They have proved theoretical results for the proposed method. They proposed an algorithm and applied it to simulated and real datasets. They compared their method with standard VAEs and showed that their method performs comparably and is more causally interpretable.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written and theoretically solid.

### Weaknesses
The experiment section is a bit weak, and it lacks comparisons with other causal inference methods for deep generative models.

### Questions

### Summary
Neural Causal Factor Analysis (NCFA) was proposed in this submission to understand source-measurement causal relations in a factor analysis framework. By utilizing clique cover based latent structure constraints and variational autoencoder source-measurement mapping, the authors claimed that NCFA has the identifiability guarantee and also achieves nonlinear factor analysis with interpretable and flexible causal understanding. Experiments using simulated and real data (MNIST and TCGA) shows effective reconstruction of NCFA under certain settings.

### Strengths
NCFA emphasizes the identifiability guarantee with the focus on source-measurement two-level dependence structures. 

With identified unconditional dependence graph (UDG), the authors reasoned that the corresponding minimum MCM graphs with minimum edge clique cover are identifiable under certain conditions, for example, 1-pure-child assumption. 

NCFA leverages existing causal structure discovery and deep generative models to achieve computationally feasible source-measurement factor analysis. 

The experiments showed that incorporating causal constraints, VAE has reasonable reconstruction performance.

### Weaknesses
The positioning of NCFA for causal structure discovery may be problematic as both causal understanding and interpretability are quite constrained. 

It is not really clear how the identifiability guarantee may be beneficial for causal understanding under the constrained settings of NCFA. 

The presented experimental results appear to be preliminary, without much explanations on causal relationships, interpretability, benefits from identifiability and flexibility by having nonlinear mapping using VAE. 

The first part of NCFA depends on the quality of UDG and minimum MCM graphs. UDG appears to be a Markov Network for statistical independence representation. By the nature of Markov Networks, UDG can be guaranteed to be an I-map but not be a perfect map for the data generation distribution. The UDG and induced minimum MCM graphs therefore may not always capture the underlying causal structure faithfully. For example, when we have a M_1 to M_5 forming a Markov chain. Based on the described algorithm, the UDG may just have a complete graph with 5-node clique, which does not really provide any additional causal understanding or constraints in NCFA. 

The authors may want to clearly define what they meant by NCFA being 'non-parametric' and 'identifiable'. For example, the overall FA framework is a parametric setting and VAEs also typically are considered parametric for the source-measurement mapping. If the authors meant that there is no need to specify mapping functional families as being 'non-parametric', it may need to explained clearly. It may also not be fair to claim the advantages on identifiability of minimum MCM graphs in NCFA over the existing other causal structure discovery methods due to the assumed specific settings. 

Math notations may need careful proofread. For example, in Section 4, $\hat{U}$ was referred as 'estimated UDG' in the second and third paragraphs but then as the MCM graph at the beginning of the fourth graph. It is quite confusing. There are in fact many of these examples in the submission.

### Questions
1. What does MCM stand for? Medil Causal Models? If so, please provide the full name in the main text too. 

2. What are the details of model structure and training, especially the VAE model constructed following the induced minimum MCM graphs? These do not appear to be included either in the main text or appendix.

### Summary
The paper combines advancements in causal discovery and deep learning, to propose a new nonparametric framework called Neuro-Causal Factor Analysis (NCFA). It uses variational autoencoder (VAE) with Markov factorization constraints of the distribution with respect to the learned graph for learning causal factors in a neuro mode.

### Strengths
1. The presentation is clear.
2. The experiements concerning the validation delta of the learning process is enough.

### Weaknesses
1. Some aspects concerning the theoretical soundness should be improved.
2. The efficiency should be further analyzed.

### Questions
1. Fig 2: it seems that all graphs can be aligned as the hierarchical structure. Is this an assumption or based on some theoretical results?
2. Definition 3.5: why this is called "observationally equivalent"? How about calling “equivalent wrt d-separation”?
3. Algorithm 1: it is clear that the partition of variables into "two groups" are critical to the performance of the algorithm. Is there any analysis about the efficiency, and the error cascade if an inaccuracy partition appears?

### Summary
This work proposes to use the VAE for modeling the factor analysis and aim to identify the factor via latent causal discovery.

### Strengths
- This work Neuro-Causal factor analysis using a VAE framework.

### Weaknesses
- Clarity is one of the main issues of this work. Many terminology descriptions are missing or without explanation. For example, what is the full name of MCM graph and ECC model? 
- Moreover, the contribution of this work is rather limited and it seems to a simple incremental of the work Markham & Grosse-Wentrup, 2020.
- The notations are confusing and the theoretical results in this paper are problematic. Theorem 3.6 states that the DAG G is identifiable with the conditions that $M_{i}\perp M_{j}\iff i-j\notin E^{\mathcal{U}}$, which is problematic. Since a DAG identifiable means that every direction for every edge in the DAG will be identified, which is impossible without any assumptions under the existence of a latent variable. In fact, this theorem relies on the theory of Markham & Grosse-Wentrup, 2020 which has several underlying assumptions and constrained which is missing in the statement of the theorem.

### Summary
This work considers the classic factor analysis model from a causal perspective. The authors introduce a new method known as Neuro-Causal Factor Analysis. Unlike traditional factor analysis, the authors integrate a causal discovery approach and a variational autoencoder tool to uncover the latent causal graph and its corresponding parameters. They show the minimum  ﻿MeDIL Causal Model is identifiable under some conditions.
Furthermore, they validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses a non-trivial task and introduces a new method to tackle this challenge. In contrast to most traditional factor analysis (FA) methods, the approach proposed in this paper can handle nonlinear FA models.

2. The identification results of this paper are novel and significant for the causal discovery and generative models community.

3. The experimental results are presented in a logical way.

### Weaknesses
1. I have some confusion regarding the conclusion in Theorem 3.6. This conclusion states that if there exist UDGs with a unique minimum edge clique cover, then we can uniquely identify that graph G. I attempted to read the proof; however, the author references the conclusions of two other articles to establish this point. Without any specific constraints on the generating function, the validity of this conclusion requires further elucidation. I hope the author can provide an intuitive proof framework to demonstrate the correctness of this conclusion.

2. The algorithm's results depend on the latent degree of freedom lambda.

### Questions
1. How can we ensure the identifiability of loading functions (f) and residual measurement errors?

2. Could you provide an intuitive proof framework to demonstrate the correctness of Theorem 3.6? Are there any graphical conditions when UDGs have a unique minimum edge clique cover?

3. In practice, how do we set the latent degree of freedom lambda?

minor typos:

 Section 2.2 on Page 4: which relax the Causal Markov Assumption? It should be the Causal Sufficiency Assumption, right?
