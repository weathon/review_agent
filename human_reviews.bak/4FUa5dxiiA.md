# Risk-Sensitive Variational Model-Based Policy Optimization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
RL-as-inference casts reinforcement learning (RL) as Bayesian inference in a probabilistic graphical model. While this framework allows efficient variational approximations it is known that model-based RL-as-inference learns optimistic dynamics and risk-seeking policies that can exhibit catastrophic behavior.  By exploiting connections between the variational objective and a well-known risk-sensitive utility function we adaptively adjust policy risk based on the environment dynamics.  Our method, $\beta$-VMBPO, extends the variational model-based policy optimization (VMBPO) algorithm to perform dual descent on risk parameter $\beta$.   We provide a thorough theoretical analysis that fills gaps in the theory of model-based RL-as-inference by establishing a generalization of policy improvement, value iteration, and guarantees on policy determinism.  Our experiments demonstrate that this risk-sensitive approach yields improvements in simple tabular and complex continuous tasks, such as the DeepMind Control Suite.

### Summary
This paper addresses the issue of risk-seeking policies in model-based RL-as-inference which arises due to learning optimistic dynamics.
The paper highlights how optimistic dynamics lead to risk-seeking policies in Figure 1.
The authors then introduce a risk parameter ($\beta$) to the RL-as-inference objective that enables (nonlinear) interpolation
between optimistic dynamics (for low $\beta$) and the true dynamics (for large $\beta$).
They then highlight connections between their ELBO (objective) and the risk-sensitive exponentiated utility for SafeRL.
Hence the paper's name, I guess.
Drawing on connections between this objective and constrained optimization with Lagrange multipliers,
they propose a method to automatically adapt $\beta$.
Intuitively, their method restricts learning such that the KL divergence between the variational and prior dynamics remains
below a threshold $\epsilon$.
That is, the variational dynamics can be optimistic as long as they're close to the real dynamics.
They provide a theoretical analysis of their risk-sensitive method and
demonstrate that it overcomes issues of risk-seeking behaviour in a stochastic tabular environment.
They also show that it fixes issues with VMBPO in deterministic continuous environments (Mountain Car), which I found to be a surprising (and interesting) result.
Finally, they show that it scales to high(ish) dimensional benchmarks such as Hopper/Walker2D/HalfCheetah.

### Strengths
Overall, I think this is a good paper.
It highlights a known (yet understudied) problem in the RL-as-inference framework (that of optimistic dynamics)
and presents a novel solution to combat it.
I found the paper well-written, I particularly liked Sec. 2 and Figure 1 as it was helpful for providing intuition for
the issue that the paper is trying to solve.
The theoretical analysis seems correct, although I have not checked it in detail.
The experiments are also well-structured and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
I do not have any major weaknesses with this paper.
Nevertheless, I will provide some comments with the aim of helping the authors further improve their manuscript.

The dynamics models are learned using an ensemble of MLPs which parameterize Gaussian densities.
That is, each ensemble member learns a heteroscedastic noise model which captures the MDP's transition noise.
Although not detailed in the paper, I assume the ensemble is a uniformly weighted mixture
$q_{\phi}(s_{t+1}\mid s_t,a_t) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b} q_{\phi_{b}}(s_{t+1}\mid s_t,a_t)$
where each member is given by,
$q_{\phi_{b}}(s_{t+1}\mid s_t,a_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\phi_{b}}(s_{t},a_{t}), \Sigma^{2}(s_{t}, a_{t}))$.
The ensemble then captures the epistemic uncertainty arising from limited data.
How do you calculate the KL divergence between the variational and prior dynamics given that they are Gaussian mixtures?
Do you assume that the output is unimodal and fit a single Gaussian to the mixture?
Subtleties like this could impact the performance of VMBPO and $\beta$-VMBPO so they should be detailed in the paper.

Also, how do you train the ensemble?
Is each member's parameters initialised differently? Or is each member trained on different data?

In my mind, the notion of risk applies in uncertain environments.
In Fig. 4b, how is this dynamics model risky?
Isn't it just optimistic and stuck in a local optimum induced by the optimism?
I'm happy to be corrected here.

I'm also wondering if Fig. 4 used an ensemble of MLPs without probabilistic heads?
The paper states that all experiments use probabilistic heads.
But this environment is deterministic so this feels like an odd thing to do.

How do you populate $\mathcal{D}\_{\text{model}}$? I mainly wanted to know how the initial state is sampled.
Do you sample randomly from the state space or do you sample a state from the replay buffer and then perform a rollout?
I later found this in Alg. 1 in the appendix. Perhaps reference this algorithm from paragraph 2 of Sec. 3.3 so that it's clear at this point how $\mathcal{D}_{\text{model}}$ is populated.

Minor things:
- There is an abuse of notation which should be made clear. That is, $Q(s_t,a_t)$ in Eq. 2/3 is different to Eq. 5. It could be made $Q(s_t, a_t;\beta)$ in Eq. 5 or there could be a sentence to explain that the notation is being abused.
- The first paragraph of Sec. 3 should reference Appendix D and not just the appendix.
- How is $V_{\psi}'(s_t)$ different to $V_{\psi}(s_t)$? I couldn't find this anywhere in the text.
- Third paragraph of Sec. 3.3 should have $\pi_{\kappa}(a_t\mid s_t)$ instead of $\pi(a_t\mid s_t)$?
- Theorem 4.3 uses "Thm 4.1" and "Thm 4.2" but the rest of the paper uses "Theorem 4.1". Be consistent.
- This sentence in the related work feels out of place. "Variational approximate RL-as-inference by maximizing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood.". Is part of the sentence missing?
- Fig. 2 caption. "Learn" should be "Learned" or "Learnt".
- In Fig. 2 it's not clear the grey area is a cliff. I'd suggest overlaying text saying "CLIFF" on the grey area.
- Fig. 3 specifies $\beta$ as a parameter. It might be clearer to use $\beta^0$ to indicate that this is the initial value of $\beta$. At the moment it gives the impression that $\beta$ is fixed.
- Fig. 3 uses "Beta-VMBPO" and Fig. 5 uses "Beta_VMBPO". Be consistent.
- Appendix C.1 "Pytorch" should be "PyTorch".
- Fig 2/3/4/5 axis numbers and labels are too small.
- Fig 3/5 legend is too small.
- In Fig. 5 the left/middle plots don't show the curves converging. Do they converge to the same value as SAC? It feels suspect not to show $\beta$-VMBPO not converging to the same value as SAC.

### Questions
- Have you added more details on the ensemble of probabilistic MLPS dynamics models?
- Have you addressed my issue with Fig. 5? That you don't show $\beta$-VMBPO converging to the same value as SAC.

### Summary
The study introduces a risk-sensitive approach to reinforcement learning (RL) by framing RL as Bayesian inference within a probabilistic graphical model, termed "control as probabilistic inference." Conventional model-based control-as-inference does not consider risk-sensitive policy learning. The authors introduce the β-VMBPO algorithm, a risk-sensitive variant of the variational model-based policy optimization (VMBPO) algorithm. The novelty of this method lies in its dual descent optimization, which incorporates the risk parameter β as an adaptive parameter. This approach is bolstered by a thorough theoretical analysis. Empirical evaluations validate the efficacy of this risk-sensitive methodology, demonstrating its advantage over traditional methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper establishes a clear connection between dual-descent and risk-sensitive variational inference, enabling the optimization of \beta in a logical manner.
1. Comprehensive theoretical analyses are provided.

### Weaknesses
1. The research's novelty appears limited. Previous studies have already introduced \beta. If the paper's main contribution centers around a reinterpretation of \beta through the lens of dual-descent, there's a need for a clearer distinction between this work and earlier research.
1. Although the theoretical approach is interestingly anchored in the RL-as-inference framework, the paper falls short in its discussion regarding the interpretation of the parameter \beta within the context of variational inference. A more in-depth exploration and dialogue from the variational inference standpoint would significantly enrich the paper.

### Questions
1. In the "PRELIMINARIES" section, Equation (5) appears to divide the reward by \beta directly. While I recognize that this might not be the primary focus of the authors, readers could wonder how such a minimal change can imbue the method with risk sensitivity. A brief and intuitive explanation addressing this would be valuable.
1. To my understanding, the pioneering work introducing variational inference to model-based reinforcement learning is "VI-MPC" by Okada et al. (2020). While the goals of the two studies might differ, I believe it's pertinent for the authors to reference this foundational work.

1. In Figure 1, an overlaid directed graph makes the illustration less intuitive. The representation seems muddled, especially when juxtaposed with the legends. It's evident that this figure could benefit from some revisions for clarity.
1. Dual optimization emerges as a crucial component of this research. Given that several potential readers may be unfamiliar with this concept, adding a reference, such as a standard textbook on convex optimization or a pertinent tutorial paper, would be of great assistance.

### Summary
Briefly, the original VMBPO algorithm learns a dynamics model
where the dynamics transitions are weighted according to the
exponential of the value of the transitions, in accordance
with the control as inference approach.
This paper modifies the VMBPO algorithm to include an inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ so that the risk seeking behavior of
VMBPO could be modulated. Another change is the way how the likelihood
ratio $q/p$ of the variational model to the true dynamics is computed:
in the original VMBPO, they use a direct estimator for the ratio,
whereas in the current work, they learn two models, one for $q$ and
one for $p$. Moreover, they suggest to tune the $\beta$ parameter by
setting a target KL divergence, and optimizing $\beta$, to achieve the
target in a similar way how the SAC algorithm optimizes their inverse
temperature parameter to achieve a target entropy.

The experiments included two simple tabular domains to show how
modulating $\beta$ controls the risk seeking behavior of the method,
and simple control tasks: Mountain Car, Half Cheetah, Walker2D, Hopper
(note that the abstract says they tried DeepMind Control Suite, but this
seems inaccurate, it seems the work only contains OpenAI Gym experiments).

### Strengths
1. The necessity of $\beta$ in the VMBPO algorithm is clear, so the
approach is well-motivated from this point of view.
2. There was a study looking at how the tuning of the $\beta$ works
in an MDP domain that showed that the method is robust to initializations
in this domain suggesting reliability of the method.

### Weaknesses
1. While the necessity of the $\beta$ term is clear, why one
should use a VMBPO-based approach to begin with was not clear to me.
The majority of the discussion was about how VMBPO can be risk seeking,
and how modulating the $\beta$ term can prevent the risk seeking
behavior, but one can also avoid the risk seeking behavior by simply
not using VMBPO. I think the advantage of using the control as inference
approach should also be explained and demonstrated.

2. There were only 3 OpenAI Gym benchmark environments. It would have been
good to include more, e.g., Ant and Humanoid.

3. The experimental results in HalfCheetah and Walker2d do not match the
published results in the original MBPO paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08253.pdf, figure 2). In particular, HalfCheetah
seems to go clearly over 10000 (reaching around 12000), whereas it barely
reaches 10000 in this paper, also in Walker, the results go clearly
above 4000, but barely reach 4000 in this paper. The results on Hopper
were indistinguishable between MBPO and Beta_VMBPO. Also the improvement
is quite marginal. I am not confident the method reliably improves over
MBPO. Also, the number of random trials was 5, which is low.

4. While there were experiments on smaller tasks aimed at explaining how the
method works, the only statistics provided in the Gym tasks were the reward
curves. It would have been better to provide some other statistics that
demonstrate that the risk sensitivity control is working as intended.

5. The computational time was not discussed. In particular, as you compute
two models, $p$ and $q$ does that affect the computational time?

6. I think the risk seeking behavior of VMBPO and that $\beta$ modulates
this are obvious, and I think too much space was used for explaining
these points. I think the simple experiments on the tabular
domains and on the mountain car were redundant, as they do not show any non-obvious
result. For example, in the mountain car task, if the $\beta$ parameter is set
sufficiently large, then clearly the variational model should try to match the
true dynamics, and the method should work. I would have liked to see a result
that requires tuning $\beta$ and cannot be achieved without simply trying to
learn the true model.

7. Equation 8 suggests an inequality constraint for the KL, yet in
Equation 9, you are optimizing for an equality constraint (as is done
in SAC, also there was no reference to SAC). I was not completely
convinced with this.

8. The works lists the necessity to tune the KL constraint target
$\epsilon$ parameter as a limitation. However, it is also necessary to
set an initial $\beta$ value, as well as a learning rate for
$\beta$. While the experiments looked at the sensitivity to these
parameters in a simple tabular task, the senstivity was not examined
in the other tasks, so it is not completely clear how reliable the
method is.

9. VMBPO and the suggested Beta_VMBPO have more differences than simply adding in a beta value. I think there should have been ablation studies on the different components of Beta_VMBPO, e.g., the tuning of the beta value, etc. (performed in the OpenAI Gym tasks)

### Questions
In this work, the ratio q/p is estimated by learning two models:
one for q and one for p, then taking the ratio. In the origianl VMBPO,
they use a direct estimator, v, for q/p. Vapnik's principle suggests
that learning a direct estimator is typically better than solving
more general intermediate steps. Have you compared with this method,
and why did you choose to learn two models?

Please also feel free to respond to any of the listed weaknesses.
