# Fusing Models with Complementary Expertise

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Training AI models that generalize across tasks and domains has long been among the open problems driving AI research. The emergence of Foundation Models made it easier to obtain expert models for a given task, but the heterogeneity of data that may be encountered at test time often means that any single expert is insufficient. We consider the Fusion of Experts (FoE) problem of fusing outputs of expert models with complementary knowledge of the data distribution and formulate it as an instance of supervised learning. Our method is applicable to both discriminative and generative tasks and leads to significant performance improvements in image and text classification, text summarization, multiple-choice QA, and automatic evaluation of generated text. We also extend our method to the "frugal" setting where it is desired to reduce the number of expert model evaluations at test time. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hwang595/FoE-ICLR2024.

### Summary
Acquiring models that generalize across multiple tasks and domains has long been a challenge for the machine learning community. This paper presents the idea of ***Fusion of Experts (FoE)***, aiming to combine the strengths of multiple models with complementary expertise to push their collective generalization capabilities. The main contribution of the paper is to formulate the FoE problem as an instance of supervised learning, which is applicable to both discriminative and generative use cases. In addition, an extended ***FrugalFoE*** has been proposed to allow efficient expert fusion while only evaluating a subset of experts at test time.
Extensive experimental evaluations on a wide range of tasks demonstrate that the proposed fusion method significantly improves the performance of individual experts.

### Strengths
- The motivation is sound, and the paper is well written.
- The proposed method casts the FoE problem of fusing outputs of models with complementary expertise as a supervised learning problem. It can be applied to both discriminative and generative use cases.
- The extended Frugal Fusion of Experts (FrugalFoE) allows to efficiently perform expert fusion by only evaluating a subset of experts at test time. 
- The proposed fusion method greatly improves the performance of individual experts on a wide range of tasks, while also reducing the number of expert evaluations at test time.

### Weaknesses
The primary concern for me is that the proposed fusion method relies on a validation set containing data samples from all $K$ domains, and potentially, the distribution of the validation data is very similar to that of the test data. I can certainly understand that traditional approaches of combining expert predictions may be ineffective, and they mostly use heuristic schemes such as averaging models' outputs or using the most confident model. However, they do not assume that there is additional validation data to access. If there is available validation data, can we train a parameterized fuser for traditional methods? Therefore, this is not fair in a sense, or can I understand that this is a setup for a new fusion task?

Other concerns are as follows.
- In the experimental section, the authors observed that "using a single expert was almost as good as using all experts" on different types of tasks. Could this possibly be the result of an illogical experimental setup? It looks like the knowledge between multiple experts is not complementary but redundant.
- In Table 3, what is the difference between CNN DM Expert (higher part) and CNN DM Expert only (lower part)? Why is there such a wide performance gap between the two?

### Questions
- Please take a look at **Weaknesses**.
- Are "Fusion of Experts" and "Mixture of Experts" two different concepts, and what is the essential difference between them?
- How to ensure that the knowledge of different experts is complementary?
- How well does the proposed method perform with test data from outside the $K$ domains?

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence

### Summary
This paper proposes a practical approach to fuse outputs of a set of models that are experts for complementary tasks. Two approaches are proposed:
* FoE-classification, where a fuser is trained on top of the concatenation of outputs.
* FoE-generation, where the fuser learns the optimal choice of expert via cross-entropy.

Additionally, FrugalFoE is proposed, as a strategy to incrementally increase the queries until a cost (loss) criteria is matched. This approach reduces the number of experts being ran.

The experimental section is solid and shows the validity of the approach in various settings, ranging from classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, QA and text generation. Models like ResNet-18 and a wide plethora of LLMs (~7B params) are used, making this evaluation relevant in the state-of-the-art.

### Strengths
* The approach is relevant given the availability of pre-trained models nowadays. Methods that smartly fuse models can have impact, since one does not need to re-train, and can incorporate new knowledge to previously trained models.

* The experimental section is very complete, and explores several domains of interest. I specially call out the experiments with LLMs.

* The mathematical derivations are sound.

* The paper is written with clear language, and very few typos.

### Weaknesses
* I found the explanation of FrugalFoE harder to follow than the rest. See questions below.

### Questions
* To train using the loss in Eq 3.3, one needs to know a priori the labels, ie. which is the correct model for that input. How reasonable is that assumption? Do we also know "exactly" which model should be selected?

* I have some doubts about Equations 4.3 and 4.4 that I would like the authors to clarify. As far as I understand, to obtain the optimal (argmin), we must execute all the experts individually (in Eq. 4.3) and all the subsets in $\mathcal{F}\backslash\tilde{\mathcal{S}}$ for Eq. 4.4. This sounds quite intensive, and definitely more intensive than just running $\mathcal{S}$ experts once. I know there is something I am missing here, I kindly ask the authors to bring some clarity in this sense. 

* Why is the cost term in Equation 4.1 summed over $f_k\in \mathcal{S}$? I would have expected this sum to be over $f_k\in \tilde{\mathcal{S}}$, otherwise the term becomes constant wrt. the queried experts, right?

* How can we use $c_k$ in practice? Can we use it to model aspects like energy consumption (for running an expert), flops, etc.? 

* Can the authors comment on Figure 2? Why is FrugalML performing so poorly? Even much worse than randomly picking the experts? 
  * Additionally, it would be interesting to add std bars for the Random Experts (selecting different random subsets of them, specially at lower values of the x axis).

* In Section 5.2, the authors claim `Though sentiment analysis is essentially a classification task, we train the fuser using the generative model strategy 3.3`. I believe this is a typo and should be "using the classification model strategy".

* I enjoyed the discussion in Section 3.3.

* Conversely, I found Section 4.3 (graph) somehow disconnected and not adding to the work. Unless graphs are used in practice in the code (did not check).

* Minor notation consistency comment. The set $\mathcal{S}$ is not defined when it first appears. Furthermore, one can find both  $k\in\mathcal{S}$ and $f_k\in\mathcal{S}$ in the manuscript, which complicates readability.

### Summary
This paper introduces an innovative approach for combining various models to optimize performance across different tasks. Recognizing that no single model excels in all tasks and considering the complementary strengths of various pre-trained models, the authors propose a lightweight MLP fuser network trained to either fuse outputs (in the discriminative case) or select the most suitable model (in the generative case) from a pool of $N$ models. To manage the computational expense of querying all $N$ models, they introduce a cost-effective strategy that selects and queries a much smaller subset, $M \ll N$. Their approach, named FrugalFoE, demonstrates impressive results in fusing outputs or selecting expert models, showcasing superior performance in tasks like image classification, summarization, MMLU, and text evaluation.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles a novel and significant issue: optimally leveraging different models for diverse tasks. While foundational models generally perform well across various tasks, they have differing strengths. Thus, an approach to effectively combine these models represents a significant advancement.
- The methodology, FrugalFoE, is both technically sound and innovative. It offers a clear problem formulation and further minimizes the need to query all the expert models without sacrificing accuracy.
- The experiments are extensive and cover a range of applications, including image classification, summarization, MMLU, and text evaluation. This demonstrates the method’s versatility and effectiveness.
- The paper effectively situates its work within the broader context of ensemble learning, mixture of experts, and federated learning, thoughtfully introducing these methodologies and their limitations.

### Weaknesses
- A primary limitation is the assumption that data for training the fuser are readily available. The proposed approach requires a labeled dataset to train the fuser network. In the discriminative case, we feed the input example to different individual models, take model outputs as the inputs to the fuser network, and train the fuser to predict the label of the input example. Similarly, in the generative case,  we feed the fuser network with individual model outputs and train the fuser to predict the best model index, which is obtained by feeding the labeled data to individual models and selecting the model that achieves the best performance. This prerequisite may not be realistic in practical scenarios, where there is no or only a few labeled data. If a large labeled dataset is available, it might be more efficient to fine-tune a foundational model or employ few-shot learning. A pivotal aspect of this research should be the generalization capabilities of the trained fuser across different tasks (e.g,. train the fuser on some tasks and test the fuser on unseen tasks), which would significantly enhance the paper's contribution.
- The paper lacks an in-depth analysis of the fuser network. Although it is described as a lightweight MLP network, there's no exploration of how different architectures (e.g., simpler networks like linear models or more complex ones like transformers) might impact performance. Additionally, details on the training configurations, such as learning rate, epochs, dataset, and stopping criteria, are missing. The influence of the $K$ parameter in the $K$-NN component of the fuser network is also unclear. What is the rationale for choosing $K=9$?
- The experiment sections lack in-depth descriptions (see questions). The paper would benefit from reallocating less critical sections (like the connection between FrugalFoE and the A* algorithm) to the Appendix and expanding on the experimental details.

### Questions
- Page 8, Table 2: Could you clarify the distinction between "TFN Expert Only" and "TFN Expert," and between "Poem Expert" and "Poem Expert Only"?
- Page 8, Table 2: What are the results for the "confidence-based fusion" and "ensemble" baselines? The same question applies to Tables 3 and 4. The confidence-based fusion seems less intuitive in the generative case, how about simply selecting the maximum confidence at each decoding step?
- Page 9, Table 4: Could you explain more details of FoE (Expert 1), FoE (Expert 2), and FoE (Expert 3)? Why does adding more experts appear to degrade performance?
- Page 4: The statement "As long as there is a label shift among the domains, we expect $E[f(X_k)] = E[Y_k]$" needs clarification. Why is this expected?
- Page 6: The phrase "Then $\lambda$ can be interpreted as the final error rate reduction we want to achieve" – could you expound on the reasoning behind this?
- Page 1: The statement "our emphasis is on generalization to test data distributions where none of the experts perform well individually". Shouldn't it be "a few" instead of "none" based on the problem formulation?
- Page 6: The condition "If ... <0 we terminate the search" should be">0"?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to train a set of experts by training the expert one at a time to be fused. Each expert is designed to complement each other during the training procedure by solving the residual gains upon introducing the new expert. Authors evaluated the method on various text domains -- classification, summarization, QA, and generation quality evaluations.

---------

Post rebuttal: With the discussion in the thread, the evaluation has been updated (see other comment for the details).

### Strengths
* The proposed method provides an interesting direction that can train multiple models sequentially to train on the residuals of the previous mixture of experts.
* Compared to pure residual approaches, because the transformation function is taken on top of each model’s outputs, we can expect this may be more general than the pure residual learning setting.

### Weaknesses
* The proposed algorithm requires multiple experts to be used together, unlike Sparse MoE, which means that the inference cost is multiple times that of each expert. Therefore, the correct baseline for the proposed algorithm is to compare it to an equal number of parameters with the sum of all individual experts. The authors should make this comparison in their paper.
* Similar to the first point, authors provide experimental results on a variety of datasets, however, they did not include many common baselines for each dataset. For example, Figure 2 has a very crude baseline (random experts) or FrugalML/FrugalFoE. I suggest authors to consider common baselines. Few suggestions are Sparse MoE or just a single model with the similar # of parameters.
