# MultiLayerDiffusion: Composing Global Contexts and Local Details in Image Generation

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Diffusion models have demonstrated their capability to synthesize high-quality and diverse images from textual prompts. However, simultaneous control over both global contexts (e.g., object layouts and interactions) and local details (e.g., colors and emotions) still remains a significant challenge. The models often fail to understand complex descriptions involving multiple objects and reflect specified visual attributes to wrong targets or forget to reflect them. This paper presents MultiLayerDiffusion, a novel framework which allows simultaneous control over the global contexts and the local details in text-to-image generation without requiring training or fine-tuning. It assigns multiple global and local prompts to corresponding layers and composes them to generate images using pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework enables complex global-local compositions, decomposing intricate prompts into manageable concepts and controlling object details while preserving global contexts. We demonstrate that MultiLayerDiffusion effectively generates complex images that adhere to both user-provided object interactions and object details. We also show its effectiveness not only in image generation but also in image editing.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper offers separate control over global and local contexts through the utilization of user-specified region masks and prompts for various conditions. This algorithm facilitates precise guidance for image generation and enables localized region editing while preserving the integrity of other regions within the image.

### Strengths
This method empowers precise control over both global and local regions, providing a promising avenue for controlled image generation.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed algorithm seems to be an incremental work on MultiDiffusion and Training-free layout control, while primarily relying on Training-free layout control. The key distinction between the proposed algorithm and the aforementioned methods remains somewhat unclear. Is the primary differentiation the replacement of global condition with local guidance in instances where local guidance is employed?

2. The method section presents challenges in terms of comprehension, largely due to the excessive use of undefined notations. For instance:
   - In the Algorithm:
     1) What does the symbol "$f$" represent in Line 3?
     2) How should we interpret "$\epsilon_j^b$" in Line 8?
   - In Section 3.2:
     1) Could you provide a more detailed explanation of the introduced diffusion layer? A mathematical definition or implementation code would be beneficial.
     2) Equation (6) contains numerous subscripts, including "$j$", "$i$", "$b$", and "$n$", while the result introduces a new subscript "$l$". Guidance on how to select "$j$", "$i$", "$b$", "$n$" for a specific "$l$" would be appreciated.

3. Could you provide insights into the methodology for selecting global scales and local scales? This appears to be a pivotal component in combining the various forms of guidance.

4. The experimental section is notably incomplete. There is a lack of quantitative comparisons with competing methods, and an ablation study is conspicuously absent. These omissions limit the comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach's performance.

### Summary
The method proposes a training free sampling method to compose both local details (i.e., object attributes) and global context such as a text prompt that describes the general scene using text-to-image diffusion models.

### Strengths
- the paper is easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- The writing quality is subpar and needs to be further polished. For example, all quotes are using the wrong quotation marks. The writing needs to further improve and a lot of redundant context and information. 
- The experiment is quite limited, where only qualitative results are provided in the main paper. Thus, the performance of method is quite unclear.
- The method novelty is limited, since it simply combines techniques proposed in composable diffusion [1] and lay-out control methods [2] for better compositional generation. I don't see any insightful contributions provided by the paper.

### Questions
- I think its worth providing quantitative metrics to showcase the method's performance.
- I do think this paper needs much more efforts to polish and run extensive experiments and ideally provide contributions.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper presents a new framework for simultaneous control over the global contexts and the local details in T2I without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The key idea of the paper in attaining  detailed visual control is to decompose the complex prompts into manageable concepts and controlling object details while preserving global contexts. Experiments demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in both generation and editing settings.

### Strengths
The proposed idea of layered generation, i.e. decomposing prompts and then guiding the global prompt with each local prompt in the image generation process is very interesting. This is more attractive from practical (e.g. industrial) use cases and is potentially widely applicable as the proposed method doesn’t require additional training and the accurate segmentation masks.

### Weaknesses
Although the proposed method is interesting, I feel the paper has few important weaknesses: Firstly, I couldn’t find any quantitative evaluations in the paper. I checked the supplementary and couldn’t find it there either. It is hard to understand the utility of the proposed method to a wide range of prompts without such a comparison. For example, I couldn’t find strong evidence as to why LayoutGPT style methods are not better than the proposed approach. Secondly, it feels to me that the results (layers) with the proposed approach, might not fuse together well in the final generation. It would be helpful to see more qualitative results (supplementary demo shows a very limited samples and the composition looks artificial in those outputs - potentially limiting the applicability of the proposed approach in diverse use cases).
