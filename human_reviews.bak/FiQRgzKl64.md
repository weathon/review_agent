# Mixture-of-Supernets: Improving Weight-Sharing Supernet Training with Architecture-Routed Mixture-of-Experts

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Weight-sharing supernet has become a vital component for performance estimation in the state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural architecture search (NAS) frameworks. Although supernet can directly generate different subnetworks without retraining, there is no guarantee for the quality of these subnetworks because of weight sharing. In NLP tasks such as machine translation and pre-trained language modeling, we observe that given the same model architecture, there is a large performance gap between supernet and training from scratch. Hence, supernet cannot be directly used and retraining is necessary after finding the optimal architectures. 

In this work, we propose mixture-of-supernets, a generalized supernet formulation where mixture-of-experts (MoE) is adopted to enhance the expressive power of the supernet model, with negligible training overhead. In this way, different subnetworks do not share the model weights directly, but do so indirectly through an architecture-based routing mechanism. As a result, model weights of different subnetworks are customized towards their specific architectures and the weight generation is learned by gradient descent. Compared to existing weight-sharing supernet for NLP, our method can minimize the retraining time, greatly improving training efficiency. In addition, the proposed method achieves the SOTA performance in NAS for building fast machine translation models, yielding better latency-BLEU tradeoff compared to HAT, the state-of-the-art NAS for MT. We also achieve the SOTA performance in NAS for building memory-efficient task-agnostic BERT models, outperforming NAS-BERT and AutoDistil in various model sizes.

### Weaknesses

- **[major]**: As far as I can tell, many of the main contributions are already published in [AutoMoE: Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts with Adaptive Computation for Efficient Neural Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.580) (Jawahar et al., Findings 2023) for machine translation and the presented work would need to outline how it differs from previous work besides applying it for different tasks.
- **[major]**: Despite WMT'14 being commonly used in the literature, they are now way overhauled in the broader machine translation literature and should be replaced by more recent test sets to put the results into the context of recent research, see **[2]** or **[3]**.
- **[major]**: The presented work should follow the broader machine translation standard to report their evaluation scores using `sacrebleu` and provide the corresponding hash that was used for generating the scores. This will ensure that scores are reproducible and do not vary across papers by up to 1.8 BLEU points due to varying tokenization and normalization, see **[2]**, **[4]**. This should replace the metrics reported in the main paper and not only live in the Appendix.
- **[major]**: While BLEU is still commonly used, there are now better metrics that correlate more closely with human judgement **[3]**, specifically I'd additionally report chrF and COMET scores.
- **[major]**: The machine translation experiments are missing a compute-matched dense and mixture of experts baseline trained from scratch without NAS to make results comparable.

### Summary
The authors propose a novel formulation to improve weight sharing methods in Neural Architecture Search. To improve the expressivity of the model, the authors propose to use Mixtures of Experts (MoE). The MoE blocks are responsible for dynamically generating the weights of the activated subnetwork architecture. In the manuscript, the authors convert BERT to a supernet and use their MoE formulation to improve the performance of the final architecture derived from supernet training, by partially decoupling the weights of the subnetworks. Results shown by their model that SOTA performance is possible across various NLP tasks.

### Strengths
1. Results of the method show significant speedup versus baseline and non-marginal improvement in the final model accuracy

2. The method to use Mixtures of Experts (MoE) as a way to perform weight disentanglement is an interesting and novel idea and is backed up by solid quantitative results.

### Weaknesses
1. The decision to use MoE as a method for weight disentanglement is not fully justified. A better explanation and introduction is necessary.

### Questions
1. In the current MoE formulation the weights for a given architecture are formed of the linear combination of m (2) expert. The combination of experts is handled by the router. Given that all operations appear to be linear, can the router not directly generate the weights?

2. The use of the experts allows the amount of weight sharing between candidate linear operations to be tempered. One architecture may use one set of weights and another can use a completely separate set, or a linear combination of the expert weights. Setting the weights to be completely decoupled (disentangled) would revert the approach to the traditional weight sharing approaches such as in ENAS. Please could the authors explain why a completely disentangled ablation is not performed (m=number of layers). Also can the authors provde an ablation for m=1, i.e. weights fully entangled?

3. The focus of the paper is on removing the need for from-scratch training of the final architecture. However the purpose of training the supernet is generally to find the optimal architecture, not to find optimal weights. Would stopping the supernet training earlier save more time?

4. Explanation of neuron-wise MoS needs a better explanation. Elements of its explanation should be in the earlier section on layer-wise MoS, such as the introduction of m value as the number of experts. Making Fig 1 less busy would help with this.

5. Can the authors explain why the final architecture performs better for having being trained via their method? Is it because the architecture found is better or because the final model's performance is improved by having a better weight initialisation?

### Summary
The paper proposes a mixture-of-supernets approach for Neural Architecture Search in NLP that uses a mixture-of-experts to improve upon the weight customization of subnetworks. This method aims to decrease retraining times and improve training efficiency. Preliminary results suggest that it may achieve better latency-BLEU trade-offs for machine translation models and more memory-efficient BERT models compared to some current methods. The study indicates potential for reducing retraining while maintaining acceptable performance levels.

### Strengths
The author introduce a novel method in the form of mixture-of-supernets, blending the mixture-of-experts method to refine the weight-sharing mechanism, which is a novel step in neural architecture search.

The proposed approach is designed to cut down on the need for retraining, which could save significant time and computational resources.
Experimental results show that the method could lead to better-performing machine translation models and more efficient BERT models, indicating an improvement over existing techniques.

### Weaknesses
The paper presents some areas for potential improvement:

1.  The study concentrates on smaller networks, which may not face the challenges of larger models where memory and computational resources are more critical. To fully evaluate the method's applicability, incorporating a broader range of network sizes and model families (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) would be beneficial for assessing its scalability and generalizability.

2. The absence of FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) as a performance metric is noticeable. Including FLOPs would provide a more complete comparison with other methods. Additionally, the exclusion of the STS-B task, a single regression task in the GLUE benchmark, is not justified; its inclusion could enhance the validation of task generalization.

3. Although efficiency is purported to be a key advantage of the proposed method, this is not thoroughly discussed in the main body of the paper. The supplementary comparison of memory efficiency between HAT and the proposed method indicates a significant memory efficiency gap. Moreover, the improvements in task performance are relatively marginal  and efficiency drop compared to other baselines is significant, suggesting a trade-off that may undermine the method's relative advantage when considering the marginal performance enhancement.

### Questions
How does the proposed method scale when applied to larger network architectures that are more commonly used in current large language model (LLM) tasks?

What impact do Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs) have on the evaluation of the proposed method, and how does this metric correlate with the performance gains reported?

Can the inclusion of the STS-B task from the GLUE benchmark offer additional insights into the generalization capability of the proposed method across various NLP tasks, particularly in regression problems?

To what extent can the proposed method's efficiency be improved to close the gap identified in the supplementary materials, and how does this impact the overall utility of the method?

### Summary
The authors leverage MoE techniques to improve upon Supernets, a common framework for NAS. They do experiments on MT and LMs, and show strong results on WMT and GLUE datasets respectively.

### Strengths
- Results seem strong on language modeling and MT. 
- Leveraging MoE techniques for modeling is intuitive.

### Weaknesses
- Paper is hard to follow and took multiple readings to understand the problem setting. Any reader not familiar with NAS area is likely to feel lost. I recommend significantly reworking the problem setup for clarity. This will greatly improve the paper. (Eg. Section 2 is confusing, and extra prose to explain what a supernet is informally and why it is used would be helpful). Connecting each subsection in Section 3 is also needed.
- k-shot NAS is extremely similar to the proposed method, and should not be taxing to reimplement. Given that this is an intuitive baseline even if k-shot NAS didn't exist, I believe this, or something similar (iterative vs joint training) is an important baseline. Without this, it is not clear how effective the proposed method is.
- More than training steps, cost (FLOPS and wall clock time) while training both initial model and final model is a more informative metric than what is displayed in Table 3.

### Questions
- When is neuron level NAS useful/practical compared to layer NAS, and vice-versa?
