- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Long-term time series forecasting plays an important role in various real-world scenarios. Recent deep learning methods for long-term series forecasting tend to capture the intricate patterns of time series by Transformer-based or sampling-based methods.  However, most of the extracted patterns are relatively simplistic and may include unpredictable noise. Moreover, the multivariate series forecasting methods usually ignore the individual characteristics of each variate, which may affect the prediction accuracy. To capture the intrinsic patterns of time series, we propose a novel deep learning network architecture, named Multi-resolution Periodic Pattern Network (MPPN), for long-term series forecasting. We first construct context-aware multi-resolution semantic units of time series and employ multi-periodic pattern mining to capture the key patterns of time series. Then, we propose a channel adaptive module to capture the multivariate perceptions towards different patterns. In addition, we adopt an entropy-based method for evaluating the predictability of time series and providing an upper bound on the prediction accuracy before forecasting. Our experimental evaluation on nine real-world benchmarks demonstrated that MPPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based, sampling-based and pre-trained methods for long-term series forecasting.

### Strengths
1.The overall idea of the paper seems sound.

2.The paper contains a substantial number of experiments.

3.The paper shows figures on the actual prediction produced by different models.

### Weaknesses
1.I have reservations regarding the novelty of the paper, what is the main differences between this work and MICN [1]?

2.The paper doesn't compare to recent SOTA models, such as PatchTST [2] and TimesNet [3].

### Summary
The authors point out that time series can take on multiple-period properties in multiple resolutions. Based on this observation, they propose to Multi-resolution Periodic Pattern Network (MPPN). Using 1d convolutional neural networks with different kernel and dilation sizes, it tries to capture multiple periodicities in multiple resolutions. Furthermore, to recognize different temporal dynamics in different variables, they utilize a channel adaptive module. Meanwhile, they introduce entropy-based methods to analyze the predictability of time series.

### Strengths
**A measure for evaluating predictability** is introduced in this paper. This measure helps in determining the suitability of a given dataset for time series forecasting tasks, i.e., assessing whether it is feasible to predict future outcomes based on past observations within the dataset. In instances where time series data contains a significant amount of noise, there is a possibility that it is impossible to find a regular pattern in this time series. Thus, in the realm of time series forecasting, it becomes crucial to distinguish between datasets with clear patterns and those that are highly erratic. The method presented in this paper offers a means to differentiate between well-structured time series datasets and those characterized by substantial noise.

### Weaknesses
**Insufficient novelty and contributions**
1. I think the proposed method is just the concatenation of existing several works. In detail, as for multiple resolutions, [2] addresses this problem in a similar way, using 1d CNN with different kernel sizes. Also, the method to find multiple periods in a time series is the same as that of [1]. Finally, a channel adaptive module is almost similar to [3]. Can you give more explanations that your method is not just the concatenation of existing ones?

**More explanations**
1. Why do sampling-based methods easily suffer from the influences of noise? Also, I'm curious about why these kinds of methods neglect the intrinsic properties of time series. Although periodicity is not modeled explicitly, it can still be considered.

2. The authors argue that "Without making full use of the properties of time series (e.g., period), relying solely on the self-attention or convolution techniques to capture the overlapped time series patterns can hardly avoid extracting noisy patterns". I think the use of the periodic property is not directly connected to reducing noise. Some papers have to be cited to make connections.

3. Why do results in [6]  highlight the importance of focusing on the intrinsic properties of time series?

4. Can you give the reason why you set kernel and dilation size to $\frac{L}{Period_{i}}$ and $\frac{Period_{i}}{r}$?

5. In Table 2, the authors provide predictability of each dataset based on Section 3.2. Can you give a more detailed formula for predictability, such as how to identify sub-strings encountered before?

### Summary
This paper proposes Multi-resolution Periodic Pattern Network (MPPN) for long-term series forecasting. It first constructs context-aware multi-resolution semantic units of time series and then employs multi-periodic pattern mining to capture the key patterns of time series. It further proposes a channel adaptive module to capture the multivariate perceptions towards different patterns. In summary, it introduces a straightforward convolutional-based network for time series forecasting, prominently leveraging the multi-scale periodic bias.

### Strengths
Generally good and robust empirical studies. It demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance to recent algorithms in similar approach, such as TimesNet. It also shows slightly better or comparable performance to PatchTST.

### Weaknesses
1.	As the proposed method share many similarities to TimesNet, it is highly suggested to provide a clear discussion on the distinction between the proposed algorithm and TimesNet. It is crucial to emphasize the uniqueness and contribution of this work.
2.	It is suggested to review the consistency of the experiment numbers and their corresponding claims. The statement "Compared to the up-to-date Transformer-based models, MPPN achieves substantial reductions of 22.43% in MSE and 17.76% in MAE" is inaccurate. The numbers presented in Table 3 do not support such a claim. PatchTST, being an up-to-date transformer-based model, shows only marginal improvement. This claim is crucial as it shows how it compares to the recent SOTA, and I would request the authors to make it clear and accurate, especially a direct comparison with TimesNet. 
3.	Regarding the time complexity analysis in Figure 5, I generally agree with the author's claim about MPPN's training time efficiency, but I still urge the author to double-check their numbers. It is highly improbable that the training time per step for 192 is smaller than that for 96. In most cases, training times increase as the prediction lengths increase. The author should provide a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.
4.	The exploration of channel-adapted patterns is intriguing. In the model analysis section, I would recommend including plots of pattern numbers 3, 4, and other notable ones discussed in Figure 4 to Figure 3, in addition to the hourly sampling and 3-hourly averaging. The discussion of periodic patterns is straightforward and I believe there is no need for a dedicated section or figure.
5.	Although I acknowledge the potential of this method, the presentation of this paper can be further improved.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new model MPPN for the long-term time series forecasting task. It contains 3 key designs: context-aware multi-resolution semantic units (multi-resolution patching) which capture patterns at different granularity, a multi-period pattern mining mechanism deployed by dilated convolution with the selected most significant frequencies from the data, and a channel adaptive module to learn adaptive weights on the mined temporal patterns. Besides, the authors evaluate entropy-based predictability for the time series datasets as an upper bound of accuracy. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the model against the other baselines, and the ablation study reveals the importance of each design proposed in the model. Also, the training time of the model is less than most of the competitors, indicating its efficiency in handling long-term time series forecasting task.

### Strengths
This paper is generally well-written, and I list some of the strengths here:

1. The motivation is clear. The paper emphasizes its focus on treating time series as an overlay of multi-resolution patterns. By doing so, the proposed Multi-Periodic Pattern Network (MPPN) model aims to capture multi-resolution and multi-periodic patterns in time series data—a strategy that is highly applicable in real-world scenarios. The implementation of this idea is also straightforward and clear.

2. Pre-evaluation of predictability. One of the novel contributions is the introduction of an entropy-based metric designed to measure the predictability of a given dataset. This offers a theoretically grounded upper bound for potential forecasting accuracy, thereby serving as an insightful metric for evaluating data quality.

3. The forecasting results are good. The MPPN model delivers superior performance in multivariate time series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models in both MSE and MAE metrics. This speaks volumes about the model's forecasting capabilities.

4. The paper includes a methodically structured ablation study. It demonstrates that the model with all three components integrated performs optimally, thus validating the significance of each individual module.

5. The training time of the model is better than all the baseline models besides DLinear, indicating a good efficiency of the model. The main reason could be the well-designed framework, as well as the CNN-based framework being potentially more efficient than large Transformer-based models.

6. The paper is well-written and the materials are organized well, offering readers an accessible and comprehensible overview of the proposed model.

### Weaknesses
1. Cross-channel/Spatial correlation: The cross-channel dependency is not explicitly discussed in this paper. MPPN mainly focus on mining the temporal patterns, and aggregating them for different variables. Although this indicates some relationship between different channels, it is not clear how the correlation of different channels / patterns is modeled or learned by the model.

2. Multiple resolution selection: In the current formulation, the multiple resolutions are selected as a fixed set, lacking a generalized criterion for selection. While this may be acceptable in cases where periodicity is well-understood, it becomes a limitation for datasets with unclear periodicities (e.g., exchange rate data). I suggest incorporating an adaptive resolution selection mechanism, particularly for cases where no prior knowledge about the dataset is available.

3. Code / Open source: The experiment details discussed in this paper are limited. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide an anonymous link to the code or a more detailed implementation guide to bolster the paper's credibility.

4. Marginal improvement in ablation study: Although the comprehensive model highlighted in Table 4 outperforms the alternatives, the gains attributed to periodic sampling appear to be marginal. I recommend that the authors conduct additional robustness tests on this particular aspect or demonstrate how this module contributes to other performance metrics, such as training efficiency.

5. Period pattern motivation: The general idea of mining multi-resolution and multi-periodic patterns is compelling. However, Figure 3 is used to claim the motivation of mining periodic pattern from the data, which might need more discussion. Specifically, the magnitude of the fluctuations at different time points may not directly indicate a clear periodic pattern. There is a lack of illustration of how this model incorporates the variance issue besides the periodicity of mean.

### Questions
1. The novelty of the multi-period and multi-resolution design may need to be discussed. The ideas of multi-periodicity and multi-resolution are not new, so I am interested in the main novelty of this work, especially when compared to previous works that employ similar ideas.

2. On page 7, you claim a 22.43% (MSE) and 17.76% (MAE) reduction in error compared to Transformer-based models. These numbers don't seem to correspond clearly with the data presented in Table 3. Could you clarify the methodology behind these calculations?

3. Your use of an entropy-based metric for measuring predictability is intriguing but raises questions. The DLinear paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf) suggests that simplistic "Repeat" models can outperform others in exchange rate datasets, which might indicate a certain level of predictability without providing actionable insights. My expectation is that predicting the daily change / return of exchange rate would be much harder since there is no such “Repeat” effect. Given that your paper shows relatively high predictability scores for exchange rates, could you comment on whether the "Repeat" effect may have influenced these scores?

4. The elements in the heat map of Figure 4 don't show significant variations, especially for HUFL where most values hover around 0.5. Could you provide further insights into how to interpret this information, especially when analyzing the model's sensitivity to various temporal patterns?

5. Your MPPN model aims to mine multi-resolution and multi-periodic patterns. In contrast, Transformers use multi-head attention which could potentially capture multiple patterns with different periodicities. Could you offer an analysis that delineates the differences and possibly the advantages of MPPN over multi-head attention?

### Summary
This article presents a new architecture for time series forecasting. This architecture consists primarily of two parts: one is responsible for extracting multi-resolution spatial patterns and periodic patterns, and the other is responsible for learning dependencies between signal channels to modulate the previously obtained output. Spatial pattern learning is done through a convolutional network, while periodic pattern learning involves using FFT initially and then dilated convolutions on the previous convolutions. The two outputs are concatenated and modulated by the second module. The second module primarily performs channel embedding, allowing separate modulation for each channel. The article concludes with experiments on 9 common datasets in the field and state-of-the-art baselines. An ablation study is also presented, along with qualitative results.

### Strengths
* The paper effectively situates the architecture within the state of the art. 
* The literature review is substantial and well-detailed. 
* The experiments are well-described, comprehensive, and the qualitative and ablation experiments are very useful.

### Weaknesses
* I can't seem to grasp the purpose of section 3.2. As the authors state, 'There exists a multitude of seminal works in the domain of predictability,' and the few lines the authors develop on the subject seem very close to the work of [Xu et al. 2019]. What is the value of introducing this method (and it's not clear if the authors consider it a contribution or not), and what are the differences compared to what already exists? The only use of predictability is at the beginning of section 4.2, where predictability is linked to the experimental results. However, as the authors note, 'Although the situation is not always the case, the general rule is that for datasets with higher predictability, carefully constructed predictive models usually tend to exhibit lower prediction metrics,' which leads to an inconclusive result without further explanation.

* Sections 3.3 and 3.4, the core of the paper, are quite short. The description of the architecture is minimal, and it would have been preferable to clarify and expand these sections significantly to assist the reader.

* No code is provided with the article as supplementary material, which is unfortunate because I am quite curious to run the experiments. The results are indeed surprising: the first module is very similar to convolutional architectures from the state of the art, perhaps even simpler. However, in the ablation study, the results without the adaptation module are much better than competing architectures. In the case of the electricity dataset, adaptation seems to bring no improvement, and only the multi-resolution component appears to have a significant impact, with results far superior to convolutional architectures. This phenomenon is quite perplexing to me, and I would have appreciated more insights on this matter.

### Questions
* Can you explain why the performances of this architecture without the channel adaptation module  appear to be better than convolutional architectures similar to this model?
