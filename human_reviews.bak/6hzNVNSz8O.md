# No learning rates needed: Introducing SaLSa - Stable Armijo Line Search Adaptation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 3, 6, 3

## Abstract
In recent studies, line search methods have been demonstrated to significantly
enhance the performance of conventional stochastic gradient descent techniques
across various datasets and architectures, while making an otherwise critical choice
of learning rate schedule superfluous Vaswani et al. (2019); Mahsereci & Hennig
(2015); Vaswani et al. (2021). In this paper, we identify problems of current state-of-the-art of line search methods Vaswani et al. (2019; 2021), propose enhancements,
and rigorously assess their effectiveness. Furthermore, we evaluate these methods
on orders of magnitude larger datasets and more complex data domains than
previously done.
More specifically, we enhance the Armijo line search method by speeding up
its computation and incorporating a momentum term into the Armijo criterion,
making it better suited for stochastic mini-batching. Our optimization approach
outperforms both the previous Armijo implementation and a tuned learning rate
schedule for the Adam and SGD optimizers. Our evaluation covers a diverse range
of architectures, such as Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, as well as data domains,
including NLP and image data.
Our work is publicly available as a Python package, which provides a hyperparameter free Pytorch optimizer.

### Summary
This paper proposes an exponentially smoothed Armijo condition to improve the stability of line-search algorithms for finding the step size of Adam. Specifically, it builds upon the preconditioned gradient search condition proposed by Vaswani et al. [2], and applies exponential moving averages to both sides of the condition to improve the stability and robustness of the found step size to mini-batch noises and random parameter initializations. Experiments are performed on both image and NLP tasks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- This paper addresses an important problem, i.e., the sensitivity of the found step size to mini-batch noises, in stochastic line-search algorithms[1, 2]. The experiments seem to be comprehensive.

- I have tested the algorithm. The algorithm seems to fix the problem of learning rate drop observed in both SLS [1] and its variants for adaptive step sizes [2]. The resulting performance of the proposed algorithm indeed improves upon previous works.

[2] Vaswani et al. Adaptive Gradient Methods Converge Faster with Over-Parameterization (but you should do a line-search)

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical guarantee is very weak. The assumption that the loss is monotonically decreasing is not realistic given the actual update direction includes momentum. This is further complicated by the fact that the step size is found by the modified (smoothed) Armijo condition rather than the preconditioned gradient. 

- I am a little bit suspicious that the step size drop in Figure 3 is caused by numerical issues. In fact, the sudden drop may happen across several iterations caused by mini-batch noises when the gradient norm becomes small. The authors may want to comment more on this.

### Questions
In a more recent work [3], the (stochastic) Armijo condition has been relaxed to allow the found step size not guarantee descent. Such non-monotone condition seems to fix the learning rate drop problem. The authors may want to consider adding this work to their baselines. Despite the theoretical weakness, I think this work is significant and would like to accept it.

### Summary
The paper modifies the Armijo line search method incorporating a momentum term into the Armijo criterion.

### Strengths
1. the paper start with interesting practical observations of existing method, and improve it via simple approach.
2. the paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
I do not see much benefit of the proposed method over the current lr schedule. As a practitioner, I do not have a strong motivation to use the proposed method after reading the paper. The reasons are as follows:

1. **Fine-tuning tasks are too simple, not convincing.**  Most NLP experiments are based on small fine-tuning datasets and small models.  These tasks are simple for optimization and insensitive to LR choices.  I am hoping to see more challenging tasks such as pretraining tasks for larger models on larger datasets, which rely much heavier on a good lr choice than the fine-tuning tasks shown in the script. 
2.  **Unsatisfactory performance.**   The performance on imagenet tasks is unsatisfactory. Unclear performance on pretraining tasks on larger datasets and larger models.
3. **Did not save the number of hyperparameters.**  The proposed method has many hyperparameters. For instance, there are at least three hyperparameters in section 2.1 (including initial lr,  c, delta, b ), beta3 in section 3.1, and two betas in section 3.4.  As such, the proposed method does not save much trouble in the current lr schedule. The title "No learning rate needed" is overclaimed, as well.
4. **More runing time**.  Backtracking methods require additional forward and backward passing of neural nets, which could be the major computational bottleneck when the model size grows. Though the authors claim they only require 3% additional running time over standard training,  there is no real evidence to support this claim.  I would suggest the authors report the wall-clock running time and compare it to that of standard training. Further, as the model size grows, the additional forward & backward passing would require much more running time as claimed 3%. 



In summary, I don't see the motivation to replace the current lr schedule with the proposed method.

### Questions
1. In Eq.2: Is v a vector or a scaler?
2. Wrong template? The current script is using ICLR 2023 template, instead of ICLR 2024

### Summary
This work presents a modification to Stochastic Line Search for online learning rate adaptation, which 1) introduce momentum to the line search parameters and 2) gates the frequency of the execution of the line search. The authors motivate these additions with a thorough explication of relevant background, including theoretical analysis, intuitive justification, and concrete demonstration of the limitations of the original method. The authors present thorough experiments across image and language tasks, with significant variance in model architecture and dataset size. The results show impressive average performance over baselines of ADAM/SGD with and without line search. The authors release the code for public use.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written. The motivation and theoretical analysis are clear. The thoroughness of the experimental setup is excellent. The contribution is very significant and I think likely to be very useful to machine learning practitioners in general.

### Weaknesses
While the presented results are very compelling, it would be even stronger to show experiments on Transformer models in a pretaining setting as well. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare different sizes of Transformer (and CNN) to show the persistence of the benefit of the method across the scaling of the model. These experiments may plausibly be left as future work (the presented ablations are more important and very thorough) but they represent practical questions that ML practitioners will have, so would strengthen the current work if included.

### Questions
Nits:
Figs 4 and 5: it is a little difficult to read these plots, as you have to go back and forth visually between the plot and the legend to see which curve is which. Consider making Salsa lines dashed / SLS lines dotted / baselines solid (or something of that nature) to help improve readability.

### Summary
The paper presents SaLSa, an approach to improving Armijo line search by incorporating a momentum term to better handle stochastic mini-batches. This is shown to outperform results without use of the buffer on a variety of different datasets.

### Strengths
- The proposed approach of applying smoothing to deal with noise from sampling mini-batches is intuitively and theoretically justified. 
- The authors present results demonstrating competitive performance on a couple of different domains.

### Weaknesses
- I'm not too familiar with the previous SLS literature, but it does not seem like a particularly surprising result that a smoothed version of the algorithm, together with a guarantee that every learning rate yields an improved loss results in convergence.
- I'm a bit concerned by the quality of the baselines. The accuracies achieved on ImageNet with vanilla SGD seem abnormally low; more care should be used in making sure the baselines ("For the image tasks we compare to a flat learning rate" seems like an unfair comparison to the baseline since line search is able to adapt learning rates. It would be better to compare to the commonly used waterfall schedule or linear decay schedule)
- "Peak classification accuracy" does not seem to be a standard metric -- it would be preferable to include the accuracy at the end of training or the test accuracy at the checkpoint with the highest validation accuracy.
- The writing is in general a bit loose and motivation for design choices could be strengthened. There are some issues with spelling and grammar.

### Questions
- In general, need to be more careful in using \citep or \citet
- It would be helpful to show that the problem depicted in Figures 1 and 3 is alleviated by using SaLSa.
- It's a bit strange to report the average or log average final loss as an aggregate metric, given how different the models and datasets are. Perhaps it would be more informative to report the relative ranks of each method.
- There are cases where SLS outperforms SaLSa -- it would be helpful to investigate further to understand why.

Minor
- full-filed -> fulfilled
- having an average -> have an average
