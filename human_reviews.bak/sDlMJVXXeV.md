# Neural varifolds: an aggregate representation for quantifying geometry of point clouds

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Point clouds are popular 3D representations for real-life objects (such as in LiDAR, Kinect and smartphones) due to their detailed and compact representation of surface-based geometry. Recent approaches characterise the geometry of point clouds by bringing deep-learning based techniques together with geometric fidelity metrics such as optimal transportation costs (e.g. Chamfer and Wasserstein metrics). In this paper, we propose a new surface geometry characterisation within this realm, namely a neural varifold representation of point clouds. Here the surface is represented as a measure/distribution over both point positions and tangent spaces of point clouds. The varifold representation not only helps to quantify the surface geometry of point clouds through the manifold-based discrimination, but also subtle geometric consistency on the surface due to the combined product space. This study proposes neural varifold algorithms to compute varifold norm between two point clouds using neural networks on point clouds and their neural tangent kernel representations. The proposed neural varifold is evaluated on three different tasks -- shape classification, shape reconstruction and shape matching. Detailed evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed versatile neural varifold is superior in shape classification particularly for limited data and is quite competitive for shape reconstruction and matching.

### Summary
The paper proposes neural varifold representations to characterize the geometry of point clouds. The neural varifolds combine point positions and tangent spaces to quantify surface geometry. Two algorithms are presented to compute neural varifold norms between point clouds using neural tangent kernels. The neural varifold is evaluated on shape classification, reconstruction, and matching tasks.

### Strengths
- The motivation for neural varifolds is well-articulated based on relevant literature from geometric measure theory and deep learning.  
- The two proposed algorithms (PointNet-NTKI and PointNet-NTK2) to compute neural varifold are reasonable extensions of related work.
- Experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks to evaluate different tasks, with ablation studies and comparisons to baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical underpinnings of PointNet-NTK2 are less clear than PointNet-NTKI.
- The performance of neural varifolds is not state-of-the-art on most tasks. 
- The network design in the manisript is relatively simple, which I am nore sure mainly results in the relatively poor performance. If so, could authors provide the design principle or experiments (if applicable) of the combination with more advanced networks to demonstrate the promising value of the proposed representation.
- More visualizations are favorble to highlight the characteristics and advantages of the proposed approach, which could be included in the supplementary file.

### Questions
- Can you elaborate more on the limitations of PointNet-NTK2 compared to PointNet-NTKI from a theoretical standpoint?   
- How do you think the performance of neural varifolds can be further improved?
- What are possible directions to extend this work for future research?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose to consider a novel representation, varifolds for neural point cloud analysis. They first familiarizes the readers with the idea of varifolds consisting of a positional and Grassmannian component, which can be viewed as the joint representation consisting of points and normals. Then, the concept of neural tangent kernels is introduced to link the kernel theory and neural networks.  The NTK determines the distance between varifolds using neural networks. The authors then propose to represent point clouds using NTK to allow comparison in the varifold representation for conducting downstream tasks.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, the authors conduct experiments on point cloud classification, surface reconstruction and shape matching. Especially in tasks where the data is limited, the results demonstrate that the proposed representation is able to capture the characteristics of the underlying shape, showing promise for further analysis.

### Strengths
- The authors carefully introduces the idea of varifolds and how it can be used to represent the point clouds consisting of points and normals. They extensively explain how metrics can be introduced in this representation space.  

- The authors thoroughly explain how neural tangent kernel can be used to introduce kernels into the domain of neural networks and how point cloud represented as varifolds can be compared. The representation as well as the derivation is  theoretically solid.

- They propose two variants of the varifold representation using neural networks: NTK-1 and 2. The first separates the positional mass and the normal elements computes them separately, while the second jointly handles points and normals, as conventional point cloud neural network models do.

- The task of using different metrics to conduct non-rigid registration is very interesting. As the proposed metric performs well in both cases of dolphin and cup, it seems to be a promising metric to compare different point cloud data and its underlying shapes.

### Weaknesses
- Despite the very interesting theoretical approach of using varifolds, its practicality remains questionable. The interesting results can be found in small-sample shape classification tasks, where the proposed method and representation outperformed other conventional methods. However in most other tasks, the method had been outperformed by conventional methods with presumably more expensive computation. Despite the authors’ claim that the representation is able to extract both global and local shape similarities, the experiments demonstrate otherwise. It would have been better if the authors proposed a specific network structure that is able to take better advantage of the NTK representation. In order to compensate for the practical disadvantages, the authors could have introduced theoretical advantages over the conventional approaches. Such seems to be missing in the paper.

- The non-rigid registration results are very interesting, however, only two samples were provided for the experiments. It would be more convincing to apply the method on various shapes to analyze the tendencies of the proposal. Therefore, I believe the experiments are incomplete.

- Some ablation study had been conducted in the supplementary material by changing the number of layers of the target network. However, as the neural tangent kernel is derived from the study that links kernels to over-parameterized neural networks, it would have also been better to present results from neural network with different layer widths.

### Questions
- Are there other tasks that the method can play an important part? For example, change/defect detection within point cloud data may be one direction of possibilities, but as the method requires taking the mean of all the elements, I am presuming it is rather difficult.

- What are the relationship between the proposed kernel and the network layers? Does the metric become more accurate as the width and number of layers increase? The authors do conduct analysis by changing the layers and comparing the final output, but I am curious about how relationship among shapes change according to the network structure. 

- As the method states, the NTK would be identical if the network tends to infinity, but as this is unrealistic, I believe there needs to be some practical solution to the network design. What justifies the selection of the current architecture?

### Summary
The paper combines the concepts of varifolds from geometric measure theory defined for point clouds with neural tangent kernels (NTK) for infinite-width MLPs. Since the initial point cloud neural network architecture PointNet is an MLP, the main results of NTK directly translate to it. The authors propose to consider two variants of neural varifolds for point clouds constructed with: (1) product of separate NTKs for point coordinates and surface normals; (2) a single NTK for extended R^6 space of point and normal coordinates.

Using the resulting kernel methods, the authors specify how to use kernel ridge regression to solve shape classification and shape reconstruction, and also perform shape matching between point cloud pairs by minimization of a pseudo-metric for varifolds.

In the experiments, the authors evaluate the proposed methods and show that: 1) classification quality can not reach the performance of a standard PointNet network, although it can be competitive in a few-shot training setup; 2) shape reconstruction is competitive to some baselines; 3) shape matching experiment through varifold metric minimization shows promising results.

### Strengths
I am not a specialist on this topic, but to my knowledge, it is the first work to view PointNet-like architectures for point clouds as NTK approach. Additional connection to varifolds looks novel and promising as it is possible that some further results from the geometric measure theory could be explored in the context of 3D shape analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. Given that the complexity of the approach is higher compared to regular trainable networks and that the performance in the applications is lacking it is hard to find arguments in favour of using the proposed approach in practice.

2. Few-shot 3D point cloud classification is an established task and it would be much more relevant to compare to approaches designed to few-shot setup instead of regular classification methods: A Closer Look at Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Classification.

3. Comparisons and proper positioning with respect to at least a couple of more recent baselines are missing: Neural Fields as Learnable Kernels for 3D Reconstruction, Neural Kernel Surface Reconstruction.

4. Additional visualizations of qualitative comparisons would be much appreciated.

### Questions
I am willing to improve my rating, but to be convinced I’d like to at least hear a couple of ideas of how the proposed method can be improved to close at least the performance gap or complexity gap (both, if possible).

Post rebuttal:

First of all, I would like to thank the authors for all the responses and clarifications. I appreciate the additional results added and all the discussions about possible improvements to the proposed method. Unfortunately, I still find it hard to improve my recommendation, since I believe this work still lacks either a (1) deeper connection to the concept of varifolds or (2) more convincing experimental results.

Regarding (1), the authors provide a link to this concept and never expand beyond using definitions to assign additional meaning to the model components that they use. It would have been more convincing if they had provided some additional implications allowed by the varifold framework.

Regarding (2), I still think that the results of the small dataset classification experiment are not convincing. After clarification from the authors, I agree that their setup is not the same as a standard few-shot classification setup. However, there are two aspects I'd like to mention. First of all, I think this small dataset setup is artificial and not practical. ShapeNet and even much larger Objaverse datasets are publicly available and we do not need to limit ourselves to its small subsets in practice. Maybe it makes sense to use another dataset (that is small without cutting its parts) to conduct this experiment. Secondly, even if we allow for this small dataset setting, the baselines for comparisons should be different. Instead of training the networks on the same amount of data, the authors can compare their models to pre-trained models in the zero-shot setting. Recent zero-shot baselines (Uni3D: Exploring Unified 3D Representation at Scale) show 88.2% zero-shot classification accuracy on ModelNet40 while the proposed approaches never reach such high accuracies even for 50 per-class training samples. These two aspects make it hard to justify the approach from a practical point of view at least in the classification setting.

Nevertheless, I appreciate the insightful ideas in this work and encourage the authors to continue to improve this submission before the next submission.
