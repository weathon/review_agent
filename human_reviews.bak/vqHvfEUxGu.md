# A Collaborative Perspective on Exploration in Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Exploration is one of the central topic in reinforcement learning (RL). Many existing approaches take a single agent perspective when tackling this problem. In this work, we view this problem from a different angle by taking a multi-agent perspective. By doing this, we can not only learn with parallel agents, which is not fundamentally different by itself, but more importantly, it unlocks the possibility of introducing collaborative exploration and learning among these agents. We formulate this problem as *Collaborative Exploration* and proposed concrete instantiations. We introduce a collaborative reward generator as a core component to induce collaboration, which can compute novelty of a state not only from one agent's own perspective, but also respect other agents' intrinsic motivation in pursuit of novelty. This leads to collaboration and specialization of each agent within the set of agents. In addition, we discussed how to effectively leverage the shared information from other agents in the data collection and evaluation phases, respectively. Experiments on the DeepMind control suite (DMC) benchmark tasks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Built on a novel collaborative perspective on exploration, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful extension for improving exploration in reinforcement learning. Overall, this paper is well presented and shows promising results via thorough experiments. I only have few questions related to details of the algorithm design and implementation.

### Strengths
(a) This paper proposes to study the exploration problem in (single-agent) RL from a collaborative perspective, which is quite novel and well motivated.

(b) The algorithm design is simple and well-presented, of which the effectiveness is well supported by solid empirical results.

### Weaknesses
(a) Maintaining $N$ training agents and environments at the same time may increase the computation and space complexity.

(b) The related work part can be further extended.

### Questions
(a) Is this the first work on collaborative exploration in (single-agent) deep RL? 

(b) Do the $N$ agents share parameters in their policy or value networks (I guess not, then all agents need to be trained)?

(c) Could you explain why the $L_2$ norm of the action difference is a good measure for behavior diversity, rather than some other designs (like difference in $\pi_i(\cdot|s_t)$)?

(d) It would be great if the authors can release the codes for the baseline algorithms as well. Details on reproducing each figure (or training process) in the paper should also be given in the readme file.

### Summary
The paper proposes a collaborative approach to improving exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than using a single agent, it introduces multiple agents that interact with separate environments in parallel. The key ideas are:

- Multi-agent formulation: Maintain a set of N parallel agents, each with its own policy and environment. All agents share a common replay buffer.
- Collaborative reward generator: Calculate an intrinsic reward for each agent that encourages it to visit novel states not explored by other agents. This induces collaboration and specialization between agents.
- Collaborative data collection: Agents can also explicitly coordinate during data collection, e.g. selecting diverse actions compared to others.
  
The approach is evaluated on DM Control tasks. Results show improved exploration and performance compared to single agent baselines and other intrinsic reward methods like RND and ICM. The idea of collaborative reward is general and can be integrated with different algorithms.

### Strengths
- Intuitive idea of converting single agent RL to collaborative setting to improve exploration.
- Flexible framework that can work with different intrinsic reward designs.
- Showcases benefits over reasonable baselines like RND and ICM.
- Evaluated on established DMC benchmark tasks.
- Collaborative rewards induce specialization between agents and 
- General idea that can be integrated with many RL algorithms.

### Weaknesses
Some of the obvious issues like increase in computation cost proportional to number of agents as well as training wall-clock time should be noted in the main paper itself. Overall given about 2x increase in computational cost, the minor improvements in performance don't seem _that_ significant and likely achievable with standard methods trained for as long (with appropriate hyperparameters).

Connections with parameter sharing in MARL literature (for example [1, 2, 3, 4]) are completely missing. The general setup of using environment experience from 'multiple' agents to train a single policy is also used in those contexts and connections with explorations as investigated here might be relevant in those contexts as well. In general the literature review seems too biased towards just the last couple years of RL papers.

### Summary
This paper presents collaborative exploration a framework for multi agent exploration in reinforcement learning. In this framework each agent interacts with its copy of the environment and all agents share information. The authors propose an exploration bonus that is aware of other agents to incentivize every agent to visit unexplored locations. The bonus can be implemented using a constrative reward or using RND. The proposed method is then evaluated on DMC15 tasks including pixel based tasks and is shown to perform better the baselines.

### Strengths
The paper takes on the interesting topic of exploration in reinforcement learning. While single-agent scenarios have received more attention, the multi-agent setting remains a bit of an unexplored territory, even though it holds promise for substantial improvements.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The method they suggest is put through its paces across various tasks, and it consistently shows better results.
The visual aids in Figures 5 and 6 are appreciated and help us get a better grasp of how the proposed algorithm works.

### Weaknesses
The paper uses the term collaborative exploration when this subject has been quite studied in the past under the name "concurrent exploration". The paper is also missing a lot of existing work in this area [1-6]. I think it is worth adding these references in the next revision of the paper as section 3.1 could seems like the author came with concurrent exploration.

It seems like the time complexity for computing the embeddings in section 4.1 is linear in the number of agents and number of states in the replay buffer. This seems detrimental, I assume that we're interested in using a multi agent method because we care more about wall clock time than sample complexity, in that case the additional cost to compute the embedding may not be worth it. Table 10 shows that the wall clock times doubles with collaborative exploration.

### Questions
"Eqn.(5) encourages the agent to visit states that are not only novel from its own perspective, but also
to respect other agents’ intrinsic motivation in pursuit of novelty."
If I understand Eqn (5) correctly it is pushing agent i towards states it has not been but also towards states that have been visited by other agents?

"Simply, we can use the softmax function as the classifier" (section 4.2) and " In the following experiments, we always select the first agent for evaluation." (section 5).
Does it mean that only collaborative exploration is able to use the softmax action selection. This might be important as CE implicitly uses a higher capacity policy.

An ablation study would have helpful to understand the impact of each component of collaborative exploration, particularly the sofmax action selection procedure.

In section 5.3 / Figure 4, could you add RND?

On Figure 5 why do we still more trajectories going towards the bottom? Shouldn't it be optimal to split and the two goals equally?

"In the experiment, we use λ = 1 for the UCB method, ϵ = 0.2 and M = 10 for the ϵ-collaborative method. ϵ-greedy method also uses ϵ = 0.2" can you explain how hyperparameters were tuned?

The number of agents used for experiments (2 - 8) is quite low, could you add some results with 32, 64, 128? It would be interesting to see how the methods scale with the number of agents. It is possible that the reward becomes too noisy and lead to worse results. It also likely explains why CE4 does better than CE8 in Table 7.

### Summary
Authors present a parallelized training algorithm for a single agent in view of pooling experience samples for exploration. The proposed method is tested on DeepMind Control Suite against several baselines across multiple scenarios.

### Strengths
Originality
It is hard to assess the originality of the submission; the proposed method is not clearly distinguished from A3C, Ape-X, or IMPALA, save a brief mention in Appendix A.

Quality
A variety of evaluation setups and baselines have been incorporated. Presented figures and tables clearly indicate a superior performance in most setups.

Clarity
Figure 2 serves as an apt visual abstract for the proposed method. Reproducibility efforts have been included where applicable.

Significance
It is difficult to gauge whether or how the algorithm works well, given that its special design oriented towards better exploration still underperforms Replica in HalfCheetah-V3 in terms of the variance proxy and that no further explanation is provided as to how that might be the case.

### Weaknesses
First of all, the “multi-agent” phrasing is misleading. Nowhere in A3C, Ape-X, or IMPALA is the term used to refer to parallel instantiations of one agent. Repurposing a well-established terminology should be accompanied by far more solid evidence than a mere footnote. Related works are poorly taxonomized. For instance, if MARL research and the proposed method are indeed “very closely related”, how is it that no MARL algorithm is tested against?
Important works on diversity, such as Diversity Is All You Need, are not discussed, and no comparison is made against information-theoretic classes of diversity-objective RL algorithms.
Despite admitting a resemblance with distributed RL, none of the cited algorithms is set up for comparative evaluation.
There is no justification as to how the variance proxy may be a better measure for exploration than, say, mutual information, as in MAVEN.
Overall, there is a mixup of neighboring lines of research, terminology, and taxonomization that make the paper exceedingly difficult to follow and its contributions hard to assess. Furthermore, agent parallelization works have long shown to be faster and scalable ways to populate state-action visitation matrices, so claiming that most existing works take a single-agent perspective is a complete disregard to several rich lines of research predating this submission.
