# It HAS to be Subjective: Human Annotator Simulation via Zero-shot Density Estimation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Human annotator simulation (HAS) serves as a cost-effective substitute for human evaluation such as data annotation and system assessment. Human perception and behaviour during human evaluation exhibit inherent variability due to diverse cognitive processes and subjective interpretations, which should be taken into account in modelling to better mimic the way people perceive and interact with the world. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that treats HAS as a zero-shot density estimation problem, which incorporates human variability and allows for the efficient generation of human-like annotations for unlabelled test inputs. Under this framework, we propose two new model classes, conditional integer flows and conditional softmax flows, to account for ordinal and categorical annotations, respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on three real-world human evaluation tasks and shows superior capability and efficiency to predict the aggregated behaviours of human annotators, match the distribution of human annotations, and simulate the inter-annotator disagreements.

- The proposed method can better predict the aggregated behaviors of human annotators, match the distribution of human annotations, and simulate inter-annotator disagreements.

- The paper introduces two new model classes, conditional integer flows, and conditional softmax flows, to handle ordinal and categorical annotations respectively.

- The paper discusses the ethical implications and potential applications of HAS.

- Training code is available to reproduce the results in this paper.

Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to HAS that can capture the variability and subjectivity in human evaluation. The paper also provides insights into how to handle ordinal and categorical annotations.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method is evaluated on only three human evaluation tasks, which may not be sufficient to generalize the effectiveness of the proposed method to other domains.

- The paper does not compare the proposed method with the latest state-of-the-art methods for HAS. The methods compared in this paper include deep ensemble (Ensemble) (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), Monte-Carlo dropout (MCDP) (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), Bayes-by-backprop (BBB) (Blundell et al., 2015), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), conditional argmax flow (A-CNF) (Hoogeboom et al., 2021), Dirichlet prior network (DPN) (Malinin & Gales, 2018), Gaussian process (GP) (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006), and evidential deep learning (EDL) (Amini et al., 2020). The most recent method A-CNF was proposed two years ago.

- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of the proposed method.

Despite these limitations, the paper presents a novel approach to HAS that can capture the variability and subjectivity in human evaluation. The paper also provides insights into how to handle ordinal and categorical annotations. However, further research is needed to evaluate the proposed method on more diverse datasets and tasks.

### Questions
I am a computer vision researcher, and I do not know the state-of-the-art of the HAS. However, the most recent method A-CNF compared in this paper was proposed two years ago. Is there any other recent work proposed in the past two years?

Ensemble achieves the best performance in Table 1 and Table 2. The proposed method is much more efficient than the ensemble method. Could you please provide a detailed complexity comparison?

### Summary
Supervised learning tasks require annotation that can be done with high certainty, such as annotating the presence of an object, drawing rough bounding boxes, or deciding scene attributes; however, many tasks require subjective labeling that is influenced by a variety of factors, cognitive biases, or personal preferences. This paper proposes a human annotator simulation to incorporate the variabilities in this second group of labeling tasks.

The method is a meta-learning framework, a zero-shot density estimator that models the agreement and disagreements among human annotators using a latent variable model. It does not require any human effort and can be used to use unlabeled samples efficiently.

The experimental results are performed on different modalities and domains that demand various levels of subjective annotations, such as emotion category, toxic speech, and speech quality assessment.

### Strengths
* Various machine learning problems require subjective labeling, and it is not easy to use crowdsourcing due to privacy concerns. The proposed approach makes such highly sensitive data to be labeled and used in learning problems.

* The proposed approach is a latent variable model. $p(z | x)$ encodes the information in the input $x$, however, the interesting part of the formulation is to introduce another intermediate variable $v$, instead of directly taking $p(y | z)$. Conditional normalising flow (CNF) formulation gives more flexibility instead of a particular distribution choice.

* Conditional integer flows and conditional softmax flows are introduced to accommodate to ordinal and categorical annotation tasks.

### Weaknesses
* In the experiments, test performances are reported, however, considering the problem as "simulating subjective human annotations", I would expect to see (i) a training to learn the latent model in a labeled training subset, (ii) generate simulated labels on a held-out training subset and (iii) training a classifier only with these simulated labels and evaluating on test set. Instead, the current evaluation is more like supervised evaluation.

*  I found the problem address highly similar to the following paper [1,2] that aims to model the label space in each step iteratively using Gibbs sampling (or previous like of work that used MCMC). This work may require annotation process in a more dynamic setting, still very relevant to subjective labelling task and I think, they are needed to discussed.

* How does the proposed approach tackle the highly imbalanced data domains? For instance, in one of the tasks, MSP podcast dataset contains angry, sad, happy, neutral, and other. When continuous labels (valence-arousal annotations of the same dataset) is used, the skewed labeled distribution will be more visible. I suspect the proposed method to cause higher uncertainty (interrupter disagreement in less discovered part of label parameter space).

* Different performance metrics are used. Particularly, Fleis' kappa for reliability of categorical labels is good. However, why did not you used Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in continuous labels instead of RMSE and the absolute error of the average standard deviations? In continuous/ordinal subjective labelling tasks, ICC reliability is one of the golden standards that define the labelling quality or difficulty of the task.

### Questions
Overall, I liked the Human Annotator Simulation approach to tackle learning domains that necessitates subjective labelling. Please see my comments in the weaknesses section.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of human annotator simulation (HAS) as a density estimation problem, where marginal distribution of how the labels would be generated by a group of annotators given a particular sample is learnt.

### Strengths
- The authors argue that existing methods take a majority vote of among multiple annotators. This is not reflective in case of majority bias, and is instead well captured by treating it as a density estimation problem. Fig 1, 2 clearly show that the predictions made by the proposed CNF algorithm  lie on the sample means and have enough variability to capture the diversity in human annotations.

### Weaknesses
[1] The whole motivation of paper is that it should be possible to capture the data bias (when majority of labelled samples are wrong), and correct for it in some way. However, in all of the tables, the ensemble (tab 1,2)/gaussian process(tab 3) seem to be performing better than the proposed cnf method. While it is qualitatively visible that CNF is learning a better density distribution, the quantitative numbers dont justify the intuition. Perhaps, the authors would be well served by explicitly identifying the samples which possess such labelling bias, correct for it (by forcing the distribution to skew), and show better performance than all other methods. Right now, i see such form of analysis as lacking.

[2]  What is the motivation behind latent-diffusion model. in my understanding, the marginal p(y|z) is already encoding information on different annotators z1,z2....z_m sampled over z. what does additional variable v inject into the model conceptually (apart from additional representational capacity).

[3]  What is the reason for separate analysis of ordinal and categorical variables? I understand that ordinal categories are ordered, and that probability estimation then reduces to summing over the continuous space of latent variable v. However, I haven't seen standard classification setups explicitly enforce such ordering constraints. Also are there any cases where annotations are continuous (for eg, annotation by a speech etc.), which could be used to explore continuous cases? That could act as an interesting toy experiment.......

[4] Possible extensions to cases where only single annotation is available for each sample:
	- how does this work compare to works which aim to filter noisy labels from the network. perhaps this could be mentioned in the related work. 

I like the fresh perspective  of learning distribution over labels, and how such system could act as an auto-labeller. However, the motivation does not reflect better performance on real-world metric (i.e. accuracy). Right now it feels like a fancy technique (i.e. density estimation) whose PRACTICAL real-world experiments i cannot see. Also, i dont see any experiments on zero-shot learning, which is the main title of the paper. 

Finally, this paper seems to present a chicken and egg problem. Most of the datasets in the real- world contain labels of only one annotator but might be biased. However, this paper does not work on them. Instead, it requires datasets where each sample has been annotated by many people. But that might not be how labelling happens in real-world. So, perhaps authors could discuss how to extend their method to single label cases where distributions could not be learnt. 

However, this work shows promise, and I would recommend the authors to improve the paper by addressing the above concerns and consider a future resubmission.

POST REBUTTAL
-----
The authors were able to address most of the comments. Three main issues are still open,

[1] The seeming unexplainable negative correlation between RMSE and Accuracy.

-> Standard intuition suggests that lower RMSE should lead to higher accuracy in classification setups. If one accepts, that there are certain annotators (i.e. group of people) who are collectively biased, and that the sample might be incorrectly labelled, then, it should be possible to ‘correct’ for it. One way, could be perhaps reestimating the correct label and retrain the said classifier and SHOW better RMSE. I very much appreciate the authors efforts to add a new metric ICC to the setup. However, the actual increase on the accuracy (which is a well-accepted metric), would have convinced further and shown applicability on real world setup. Note that i am not asking for additional experiments on datasets which have only one label per sample, but only the performance improvements in the context of experiments the authors have already performed.

[2] Zero shot density estimation.

-> standard learning assumes that the neural net fits a density (which does not change) after the machine has learnt. during inference, a sample (from same/different distribution) is fed to the model and evaluated. The machine cant adapt its learnt density, since that is encoded in the weights which remain static.
->the authors clarify zero shot as the ability to predict density of annotator responses p*, from a single phrase (x*).
	-> this might work, if the annotators (say A1) labelled a particular sample x1 (which was SEEN during training), and network is asked to predict A1’s beliefs for a new sample x* (which has not been seen). However, the problem then does not remain zero shot since A1 was already seen by the network.
	-> If we accept (free will), i.e. one’s personal beliefs are independent of statistical treatments of how other people respond, then merely sampling from the learnt distribution of annotator response, to ‘simulate’ how a prospective unseen annotator shall respond might not work.

[3] Dynamic density adaptation

The idea of giving  networks the ability to adapt their densities dynamically to if a given sample is OOD seems promising. The only issue is that personal beliefs cant be given a density treatment. If so, then it doesn't remain zero shot.

Overall, this is an interesting work, along above three points, it is not clear in what context this will be useful if it can not be used to improve the performance.

### Questions
- relevance to title of the paper.
	- paper is titled zero shot density estimation, by zero shot i understand that a sample which is different from the original dataset on which the estimator was fit, could be used. given a set of gt classes, the network should dynamically predict distribution of labels over annotators. However, i see no such experiments, with training/inference being done over SAME dataset of speech, toxicity, and emotion annotations.
