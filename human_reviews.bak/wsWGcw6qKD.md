# Toward Student-oriented Teacher Network Training for Knowledge Distillation

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
How to conduct teacher training for knowledge distillation is still an open problem. It has been widely observed that a best-performing teacher does not necessarily yield the best-performing student, suggesting a fundamental discrepancy between the current teacher training practice and the ideal teacher training strategy. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of training a teacher that is oriented toward student performance with empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our analyses are inspired by the recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher’s capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. We theoretically establish that ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data as long as the feature extractor of the learner network is Lipschitz continuous and is robust to feature transformations. In light of our theory, we propose a teacher training method SoTeacher which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into ERM. Experiments on benchmark datasets using various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs confirm that SoTeacher can improve student accuracy consistently.

### Summary
The authors investigates how to properly train a teacher model aimed at improving the student generalization performance, rather than the teacher generalization performance. Rooted in a theoretical analysis showing that a teacher model can indeed learn the underlying true label distribution they empirically propose to do so, by modifying the training objective of the teacher to include Lipschitz and consistency regularization.

### Strengths
- Research into how to train teachers explicitly aimed at improving student performance is important, and in large part orthogonal to most common distillation on improving knowledge distillation techniques.
- The authors provide both theoretical analyses and supporting empirical experiments.
- There are a sufficient amount of (diverse) experiments investigating the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
I will separate my concerns into two parts; one on the theoretical analysis and one on the empirical experiments.

**Theoretical**
- The use of $\mathbb{E}$ for the *empirical* expectation is very unconventional, and I would strongly suggest to change this notation. This also conflicts with mentions of distributions later on. It is unclear when we are considering random variables and emprical observations.
- *"[...] of the distillation data, which is often reused from the teacher’s training data."* It appears as reusing the teacher's training data is an underlying assumption of the paper, which is a notable assumption, and should be stated explicitly as an assumption.
- *"In particular, minimization of Eq. (1) would lead to $f(x) = 1(y)$ for any input x, [...]"*. Why does this hold? There are no assumptions on $\ell(f(x), y)$ in (1), and the statement would not hold in general?
- Page 4 above (3). Is this the same softmax as other places? If not, why? If so, fix notation.
- *"[...] a continuous distribution with finite variance, namely $\mathrm{Var}[X|z] \leq \nu_z$"*. Note, $\mathrm{Var}[X|z] \leq \nu_z$ is *bounded* variance not only finite variance. What is the true assumption here?

**Empirical**
- The authors never compares to the conventional and very simple setting of early-stopping the teacher and/or carefully tuning the temperature scaling of the teacher predictions as is commonly done in practice.
- You both state that *"This demonstrates that our regularizations are not sensitive to hyperparameter selection."* and argue that *"It is thus
possible to further boost the performance by careful hyperparameter tuning"*, which seems contradicting.
- About Figure 2(a): *"[...] the teacher accuracy constantly decreases while the student accuracy increases and converges."* The teacher accuracy does not constantly decrease, but at best appear to have a downward trend. Furthermore, it is a stretch to say that the student accuracy converges due to no increase in 1 of 4 intervals. *"This demonstrates that excessively strong Lipschitz regularization hurts the performance of neural network training [...]"*. This is not supported by the figure where the teacher test accuracy for $\lambda_{LR} = 0.5 \cdot 10^{-6}$ and $\lambda_{LR} = 2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ is equal. Hence, the stronger regularization does not really affect the teacher performance.
- Throughout the paper, it is argued that a reduced teacher performance can yield improvements in the student generalization. However, from Figure 2(c)  at the performance of both the teacher and the student increase when using the cosine, cycle or piecewise schedules compared to the standard procedure. In fact, only the case of linear schedule (used elsewhere in the paper) show an increase in student performance combined with a decrease in teacher performance. Thus, it is unclear what the effect the experiments actual show? Is the improvement merely an artifact of other parts of the training scheme?
- There are no comparisons to Park et al. (2021), "Learning Student-Friendly Teacher Networks for Knowledge Distillation", although they provide experimental analysis on identical settings as this paper, and appear to notably outperform the proposed SoTeacher procedure. Granted, Park et al. (2021) propose a more involved procedure, but a comparison is needed.
- Section on Student fidelity: Care must be taken, when interpreting teacher-student agreement (as argued by Stanton (2021)). Improved agreement does not imply that the student learns better from the teacher. This can merely be an artifact of improved student performance (or decreased teacher performance).

**Minor**
- The introduction lacks reference to Mirzadeh et al (2020), "Improved Knowledge Distillation via Teacher Assistant" on the teacher-student gap.
- *"[...] namely $x_z := \gamma(x_z)$."* Overloaded notation here. Also, there is an inconsitent use of $x_{z_m}$ vs. $x_m$. For instance, it is unclear what $x_m$ in $h_m := f_E(x_m)$ refers to?
- *"[...] for any two inputs $i$ and $j$ [...]"* and other places. It is odd to refer to inputs by their indices. Replace by $x^{(i)}$ or write *"[...] for any two inputs indexed by $i$ and $j$ [...]"*
- Mention somewhere that the proofs are in the appendix.
- Table 1: Reconsider the "WRN40-2/WRN40-1" notation in the table, as it is not clear what is the teacher and student.
- The related works on "Understand knowledge distillation" miss references to strong theoretical works from Phuong and Lampert (2019), "Towards Understanding Knowledge Distillation", Borup and Andersen (2021), "Even your Teacher Needs Guidance: Ground-Truth Targets Dampen Regularization Imposed by Self-Distillation", and Mobahi et al. (2020), "Self-Distillation Amplifies Regularization in Hilbert Space".
- The related works on "Alleviate “teacher overfitting”." lacks reference to Dong (2019), "Distillation ≈ Early Stopping? Harvesting Dark Knowledge Utilizing Anisotropic Information Retrieval For Overparameterized Neural Network".

### Questions
- Figure 1: Why does a student distilled from a teacher checkpoint with 55-60% accuracy yield a test accuracy of about 71%, thereby exceeding the teacher significantly? 
- Figure 1: It is known that early-stopping the teacher is beneficial, and SoTeacher does not improve over an early-stopped teacher (at 150 epochs). It is unclear why this approach is better than early stopping?

### Summary
This paper studies knowledge distillation and, in particular, the extent to which the teacher-model affects the student's performance.

The starting point of the authors' investigation is recent literature which suggests that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher's capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. The authors show theoretical evidence which suggest that, as long as the feature extractor of the learner model is (i) Lipschitz continuous; (ii) is robust to feature transformations;  the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution. Then, based on their theoretical considerations, the authors propose the "SoTeacher"  training method which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into the teacher's training process.

### Strengths
Interesting theoretical approach for understanding the mechanics of distillation along with several experimental evidence to support the author's claim. The proposed method seems to give consistent improvements whenever applied (although sometimes rather marginal).

### Weaknesses
— The proposed method often times gives marginal improvements, while it introduces two extra hyper-parameters for the training of the teacher model (which is typically very costly to re-train in practical large-scale applications. That said, the authors do show that their method is relatively robust to the choice of these hyperparameters.)

— The role of the teacher as a "provider of estimates for the unknown Bayes conditional probability distribution" is a theory for why distillation works that applies well mainly in the context of multi-class classification, and especially in the case where the input is images. (Indeed, there are other explanations for why knowledge distillation works, as it can be seen as a curriculum learning mechanism, a regularization mechanism etc see e.g. [1])

In that sense, I feel that the author should either make the above more explicit in the text, i.e., explicitly restrict the scope of their claims to multi-classifcation and images, or provide evidence that their technique gives substantial improvements on binary classification tasks in NLP datasets (but even in vision datasets).

— One of the main reasons why knowledge distillation is such a popular technique, is because the teacher can generate pseudo-labels for new, unlabeled examples, increasing the size of the student's dataset. (This is known as semi-supervised distillation, or distillation with unlabeled examples, see e.g. [2, 3, 4]. ) It seems that the current approach, typically decreases the test-accuracy of the teacher model — a fact which typically impairs the student's performance in the semi-supervised setting [3, 4].

### Summary
This paper presents SoTeacher, a method to train teacher models that lead to better student models after knowledge distillation. The main idea is to incorporate Lipschitz and consistency regularization in training the teacher model. The authors claim that this is motivated by the theoretical analysis that the authors conduct, which shows that the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution as long as the feature extractor of the teacher is Lipschitz continuous and robust to feature transformations.

### Strengths
* Training better-suited and student-oriented teachers is an important problem in knowledge distillation. Theoretical analysis of distillation is also of interest to the field.
* The theory sheds light on why distillation may work in practice: a teacher network can learn the true label distribution of the data under mild assumptions.
* Some empirical results are presented that support the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
* The dependence on $\delta$ in Lemma 3.5 seems to be very strong. Can Matrix Bernstein be used instead of Chebyshev to get a $\log(1/\delta)$ dependence?
* The proposed theory does not explain why (higher test accuracy) teachers may not lead to better students. 
* The method seems to be at odds with the theory. If the assumptions of Lipschitz continuity and transformation-robustness of the feature extractor tend to be satisfied in practice, then the theoretical results hold. So, why do we need the additional regularization terms that are introduced by SoTeacher?
* The approach introduces two additional hyperparameters corresponding to the two additional regularization terms that have to be tuned.
* Evaluations on ImageNet, the largest and most real-world dataset considered, show only a marginal improvement.

### Questions
1. Does the presented theory explain why a better teacher may not necessarily lead to a better student?
2. Why does the method not perform as well on ImageNet?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem on how to conduct teacher training to improve student model in knowledge distillation setting. Based on recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher’s capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs, this paper theoretically establish that the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data as long as the feature extractor of the learner network is Lipschitz continuous and is robust to feature transformations. In light of the theory, the paper proposes a teacher training method called SoTeacher which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into ERM. Experiments on benchmark datasets using various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher student pairs confirm that the proposed teacher training method can improve student accuracy consistently.

### Strengths
Originality: 
- This paper studies the feasibility of training the teacher to learn the true label distribution of its training data.
- The paper theoretically proves that when the network is Lipschitz continuous and is robust to feature transformations, the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data. Empirical experiments show that adding Lipschitz and Consistency regularizations can improve student accuracy consistently.

Quality:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Significance:
- Knowledge distillation is an important topic in both academia and industry. This paper studies the problem on how to conduct teacher training to better approximate the true label distribution on training data, which could benefit the community.

### Weaknesses
- Per my understanding, to make the teacher learn the true label distribution of its training data, the key is to resolve the overfitting issue on training data, because a teacher trained towards convergence tends to overfit the hard label. This paper proposes to add Lipschitz and Consistency regularizations to alleviate the overfitting issue. It would be great if the paper can have a more comprehensive comparison with other methods that were proposed to solve the same issue, e.g., early stopping. As shown in Figure 1(b), it seems the Standard teacher early stopped after 150 epochs has a pretty decent performance.
- The Lipschitz and Consistency regularizations are one of the most important contributions of this paper, but the readers need to read Appendix to fully understand how these two regularizations are applied. Considering the length of the Appendix is not very long, I would suggest making them clear in the main paper.
- In the experiments, it is unclear how the number of epochs impact the results.
