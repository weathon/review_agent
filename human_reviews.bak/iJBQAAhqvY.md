# RealFM: A Realistic Mechanism to Incentivize Data Contribution and Device Participation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Edge device participation in federating learning (FL) has been typically studied under the lens of device-server communication (e.g., device dropout) and assumes an undying desire from edge devices to participate in FL. As a result, current FL frameworks are flawed when implemented in real-world settings, with many encountering the free-rider problem. In a step to push FL towards realistic settings, we propose RealFM: the first truly federated mechanism which (1) realistically models device utility, (2) incentivizes data contribution and device participation, and (3) provably removes the free-rider phenomena. RealFM does not require data sharing and allows for a non-linear relationship between device accuracy and utility, which improves the utility gained by the server and participating devices compared to non-participating devices as well as devices participating in other FL mechanisms. On real-world data, RealFM improves device and server utility, as well as data contribution, by up to 3 magnitudes and 7x respectively compared to baseline mechanisms.

### Summary
This work builds on [Karimireddy et.al. (2022)] and develops a federated mechanism that incentivizes truthful participation and data contribution while provably removing the free-rider problem. The methods eliminate the requirement for data sharing while achieving a high-quality global model following the developed reward protocol - per non-linear modelling of utility with accuracy- that compensates rational devices for participation with more data.

### Strengths
This work develops a federated mechanism that incentivizes truthful participation and data contribution while provably removing the free-rider problem. The methods eliminate the requirement for data sharing while achieving a high-quality global model following the developed reward protocol - per non-linear modelling of utility with accuracy- that compensates rational devices for participation with more data.

### Weaknesses
1. This work builds on  [Karimireddy et.al. (2022)]. The derivation to model accuracy in (1) and (2), following [Karimireddy et al., 2022] and moreover, [Mohri et al., 2018] assumes for m i.i.d. samples. Will it enjoy generalization to the non-i.i.d. case? 
2. Some inconsistencies and incompleteness due to unclear representation. For instance, the authors mention generalizing $\phi_i$ to become a convex and increasing function (but in which variable), and also, in actuality, the utility is modelled as a concave function? Following that, Assumption 2  needs further clarity. Another concern is Fig. 2, which is not well-justified for the said "payoff function. I don't see this claim has been experimentally validated apart from numerical evaluation.  
3. How a_\textrm{opt} is derived/obtained?
4. If the profit margin of the central server, defined as p_m, is fixed and known by all devices, I am not sure why it is used after all. (in the later experiments, this is used to indicate the degree to which the server is greedy). Assuming this is unknown would be an interesting analysis. Also, the definition of profit margin should be made more rigorous.
5. As the authors mentioned, it is hard to bond the composition function $\phi$, and I am still not sure how, particularly with this framework, we can ensure increased data production leads to better payoffs. In principle, one has to factor in the quality of data or limit combinatorial properties.
6. Evaluations:
 - Indicate the choice of parameters: z_i.
- Can the authors be more precise on the whole experimental setup? Specifically, how "more data" is used in practice? Did I miss something? 
 - In its current form, the discussion on device utility is not rigorous, for instance, how it is evaluated. It would be interesting to evaluate per-device performance, apart from the server's utility, as Top-1 accuracy with optimal data contribution and, later, under the influence of accuracy shaping (with RealFM?). Then, can we get the best of both worlds, a high-quality model with improved generalization/personalization performance? Please comment.

Minor suggestion:
In the Fig. 1 caption, it should be said, in my understanding, as such that RealFM ensures better utility for a "truthful" participation instead.

### Summary
To address the free-rider issue in federating learning, this paper proposes RealFM, a mechanism that takes into account device utility and incentivizes data contribution and device participation. Compared with previous work by Karimireddy et al. (2022), RealFM allows for a non-linear relationship between device accuracy and utility.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents an interesting approach to address the free-rider problem in federated learning.
2. Convex utility functions do hold in many instances, and it is necessary to design a mechanism to incentivize device participation for such cases, as this paper does.

### Weaknesses
1. The assumption that the closed form of each device's utility function is known, which may not always be realistic.
2. RealFM distributes model accuracy and rewards based on the amount of data provided by each device. This may raise questions about potential cheating. It would make more sense to depend on each device's marginal contribution to model accuracy, provided that it can be easily and accurately determined. 
3. Theorem 4, which claims that RealFM eliminates the free-rider phenomena, may not be particularly thrilling. Designing a contract to incentivize individuals when their exact contribution is known is not a challenging task.
4. The comparison between linear RealFM and local training does not effectively demonstrate how well RealFM incentivizes non-linear devices' contribution to model training. It is understandable that the authors cannot be blamed for weak baseline algorithms, as this paper is the first to aim at incentivizing device data contribution in a non-linear setting. However, in such cases, it would be more valuable to have theoretical guarantees of data maximization to truly showcase the strength of RealFM, which the paper lacks, except for the linear setting.

### Questions
The authors provide explanations for modeling the relationship between model accuracy and data quantity as Eq. (1) and (2), it would be interesting to explore whether the results can be generalized to accommodate more general accuracy functions.

### Summary
This paper proposes RealFM to incentivise devices to participate in training and alleviate the threat of free riders. The paper considers that each rational device wish to maximise its utility, which depends on its cost of participation and non-linearly on its model accuracy and monetary reward. RealFM involves giving each device a monetary reward and design/use a “accuracy shaping”  function to boost a device’s model accuracy and incentivize it to produce more data.

### Strengths
- The paper novelly consider utility as a non-linear function of model accuracy. This makes accuracy shaping (incentivising contribution beyond local optimal amount) harder. 
- The paper is generally written well although some notations should be defined earlier.

### Weaknesses
- Some assumptions are simplistic and limit the significance of the work. In equation 1, the accuracy is modelled to depend solely on the number of data points but in practice, devices may have data with different quality, diversity and noise. Moreover, it is hard to decide the difficulty of the learning task $k$ and the server would not have access to data for tuning (Sec. 6) before incentivization. As $a$ is an upper bound, the individual rationality for the upper bound does not translate to rationality for the expected/actual values. 
- The advantage of this work over the existing work has to be made clearer. There needs to be a deeper discussion about Shapley value based/collaborative fairness approaches including Xu et. al. (2021) and Wang et. al. (2020). In appendix A, it is suggested that these work “assume that devices are already willing to contribute all of their data”. This claim may be inaccurate — these work guarantees that contributing less (nothing) leads to less (no) reward thus devices would respond by contributing more data as in this work. The difference is that there is no closed form function for device $i$ utility.

- Some notations are used before they are defined or explained (e.g., $[\mathcal{M}^U(\cdot)]_i $ in Theorem 2). This makes the claims unclear and harder to understand.
- The central server has to compute $m_i^o$ and $m_i^*$ based on the declared $\phi_i$ and $c_i$. Device $i$ may misreport the cost to get a better reward.

### Questions
Questions
1. In related works, it is mentioned that Karimireddy et al. (2022) “requires data sharing between devices and the central server”. Is the amount of data sharing the same as centralised FL? How does the amount of sharing in this work differ?
2. The Shapley value and collaborative fairness based approaches in existing work may not assume that devices are willing to contribute data. They just guarantee if they are unwilling and contribute less (nothing), they receive less (no) reward. Resultingly, rational devices should contribute more data as in this work. Can you clarify and make the differences/advantages of your work more specific?
3. What is the implication/significance of Theorem 2? 
4. Does the mechanism _need_ monetary rewards to incentivise devices (can the profit margin be set to 1)?
5. In Eq 10, must $\phi_C(a(\sum m))$ be less than $\sum m$ to ensure a profit margin? 
6. What does $\epsilon$ in Theorem 3 represent or control?
7. In practice, how does the central server produce a model with accuracy $a(m_i^o) + \gamma_i(m_i)$? Is it guaranteed to be less than $a(\sum m)$? Does the server solve for the number of additional data points to use?


Minor suggestions
* The theorem and corollary should come with intuitive description to aid understanding. For example, for C1, a device with lower marginal cost has higher utility and would contribute more data. 
* In definition 1, $m$ can be used in place of $\sum \mathbf{m}$. $\mathbf{m}$ is not defined.

### Summary
The presented research addresses the challenges of edge device participation in federated learning (FL) and the shortcomings of existing FL frameworks when applied in real-world contexts, particularly in addressing the free-rider problem. In response to these issues, the authors propose a novel approach called RealFM, which introduces several key innovations including Realistic Device Utility Modeling, Incentivizing Data Contribution and Participation, and Elimination of the Free-Rider Phenomenon. Experiments show that RealFM exhibits excellent performance.

### Strengths
RealFM represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of federated learning, addressing the need for more realistic settings and incentives for edge device participation. Its ability to model device utility, eliminate the free-rider problem, and improve utility and data contribution is particularly promising for advancing FL in real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1. In the experimental setting, the number of devices is not large, which is not very consistent with the actual application scenario.
2. Intuitively I know roughly what Server Utility and Average Data Contribution mean. But in detail, I may still not fully understand how Server Utility and Average Data Contribution are Numerized. In particular, I don’t quite understand why Server Utility has been improved so much.

### Questions
How will performance change when the number of devices increases?
Can you explain Server Utility and Average Data Contribution in simpler and more intuitive language?
