## Abstract
Federated learning is a powerful paradigm for large-scale machine learning, but it
faces significant challenges due to unreliable network connections, slow commu-
nication, and substantial data heterogeneity across clients. FedAvg and SCAFFOLD are two prominent algorithms to address these challenges. In particular,
FedAvg employs multiple local updates before communicating with a central
server, while SCAFFOLD maintains a control variable on each client to compen-
sate for “client drift” in its local updates. Various methods have been proposed
to enhance the convergence of these two algorithms, but they either make imprac-
tical adjustments to algorithmic structure, or rely on the assumption of bounded
data heterogeneity. This paper explores the utilization of momentum to enhance
the performance of FedAvg and SCAFFOLD. When all clients participate in the
training process, we demonstrate that incorporating momentum allows FedAvg
to converge without relying on the assumption of bounded data heterogeneity even
using a constant local learning rate. This is novel and fairly suprising as existing
analyses for FedAvg require bounded data heterogeneity even with diminishing
local learning rates. In partial client participation, we show that momentum en-
ables SCAFFOLD to converge provably faster without imposing any additional
assumptions. Furthermore, we use momentum to develop new variance-reduced
extensions of FedAvg and SCAFFOLD, which exhibit state-of-the-art conver-
gence rates. Our experimental results support all theoretical findings.

### Summary
Under the federated learning paradigm, this work tries to validate the effectiveness of adding a momentum item to local client updating. Specifically, in each communication round, the proposed method will require the center server to broadcast the global gradient information to all clients (along with the updated model parameters). Then, the local clients embed the global gradient information into the local updating steps as a momentum item.

The strategy is simple and straightforward, just as the title highlighted. Particularly, this work gives detailed proof to validate the effectiveness of the simple strategy, which is appreciated (but with some mistakes). This work also empirically shows the effectiveness of the proposed method through some easy experiments.

### Strengths
The presentation is clear and logically consistent.
Furthermore, the proposed method, momentum acceleration by transiting the global gradient information to local clients, should be empirically useful and improve practical performance.

### Weaknesses
1.	The same algorithm has been proposed by multiple works [1,2]. FedCM in [1] is exactly the same as the proposed method, and [1] also gives theoretical guarantees under general convex or non-convex smooth assumptions, it is not the case as this work claimed: “However, whether momentum can offer theoretical benefits to FL remains underexplored”.

2.	There are mistakes with the proof of the main result (Theorem 1) and implicitly using of extra assumptions, so the correctness of the main results is doubtful. Please check the following Questions 2 and 4.

3.	The problem complexity is studied over the convergence rate under the same fixed hardware budget, such as communication cost or memory consumption. However, this work forgets to mention the extra requirement over the communication budget or the local storage.
(a)	Firstly, the costs of the downlink communication may be two times more expensive than other methods since the proposed method requires the broadcast of the extra averaged gradient information from the center server to each client, together with the new model parameters.
(b)	If the algorithm tries to maintain the same communication cost, then it can only broadcast the averaged gradient information. But it will require the local client to save a copy of the initial parameters of (r-1)-step, i.e., transferring the global updating step to local clients.

4.	Despite the doubt about proof, the method itself is not novel. Embedding local or global momentum seems straightforward. Meanwhile, considering the broad application scenarios of FL, the experiment is too simple, which is not valid to show the effectiveness of the method. However, if the proof can be validated, those shortages can be largely mitigated.

### Questions
1.	I am totally not sure how to build the relationship between ∇fi(x) and ∇f(x) without the bounded data heterogeneity assumption. I.e., without the popular bounded data heterogeneity assumption, how the local gradient information contribute to the global convergence? Can you briefly explain it?

2.	The second question is independent but may be correlated with the first one. I checked the proof of Theorem 1 (Theorem 11 in the Appendix), and the building of the above relation can track the source back to Lemma 5. However, the very second inequality of the proof of Lemma 5 (Page-14), which builds the above relationship, seems to be wrong to me. Considering the updating step is x^{r+1} = x^{r} – γg^{r+1}, the item −γ||∇f(x^{r})||2 comes out from nowhere, and the sign of the item γ⟨∇f(x^{r}),g^{r+1}⟩ should be negative, and it is the real descent item.
Then, without Lemma 5, the most important result in this work, Theorem 1, may be wrong.

3.	This work uses Young’s inequality four times (Page 14, 17, 22 and 25), but actually, I am not really sure how to get the derived inequality by applying Young’s inequality each time. Please elaborate on each one.

4.	This question is correlated with the Question 1 and 3. Basically, each time when you use the Young’s inequality, you will use the relation, E||x^{r} – x{r−1}||^2 <= γ^{2}E(ξ_{r-1} + E||∇f(x^{r-1})||^{2}) in next step, for example, it has been used to derive the second inequality in Page 22.
It is not true to me without any assumptions. Basically, you are saying the averaged gradient can be bounded by the true gradient with some error, this is basically a (new) variant assumption of the assumption you claim you have abandoned (bounded data heterogeneity assumption). I believe you should not abandon the more standard bounded data heterogeneity assumption.

5.	I checked the mentioned work VRL-SGD that can handle unbounded data heterogeneity. It is not published, and the soundness of the proof is being doubted in the previously peer-reviewing stage. You should be careful to present the conclusions of VRL-SGD as formal results in your work.

### Summary
This paper explores the application of momentum to enhance the performance of FEDAVG and SCAFFOLD, two leading federated learning algorithms. It achieves a faster convergence without relying on the bounded data heterogeneity assumptions and introduces new variance-reduced extensions, exhibiting state-of-the-art convergence rates.

### Strengths
1. This paper is easy to follow.
2. The incorporation of momentum enhances the convergence rates of both FedAvg and SCAFFOLD. And this improvement has been substantiated through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

### Weaknesses
1. The final convergence rate achieved by the authors does not sufficiently account for the impact of the momentum coefficient. Please clarify this issue.
2. In fact, FedDyn [1] demonstrates a faster convergence rate compared to the authors' findings in this paper, which is also without the need of clients’ variance assumptions. This observation may highlight the potential limitations in the author's theoretical contributions.
3. The authors' work seriously lacks comparative experiments, including comparison with various momentum-based federated algorithms [2].
4. The author's experimental work lacks a comprehensive discussion of a key hyperparameter, momentum coefficient.

### Questions
This paper lacks a comprehensive discussion regarding the limitations of the proposed algorithms. It is evident, for instance, that SCAFFOLD exhibits a suboptimal performance at very low sampling rates [2], leaving uncertainty regarding the extent to which the authors' improved algorithm can address this issue.

Post-rebuttal Comments:
I would like to thank the authors for their responses. Many of my concerns have been addressed, including both the theoretical and experimental analyses of the hyperparameter $\beta$. But I may still be a little concerned with the authors' claims on their theoretical contributions of the convergence, which is particularly defeated by the faster convergence rate achieved by FedDyn (though FedDyn requires a clients’ solution optimizer). Overall, I would raise my score to 5.

### Summary
This paper studies the impact of adding a simple momentum term to standard Federated Learning algorithms (namely, FedAVG and SCAFFOLD) to mitigate client drift by "anchoring" local gradients closer to an estimate of the gradient of the global function computed at the server side. State-of-the-art convergence rates are obtained in the non-convex and smooth setting, without relying on the common assumption of bounded data heterogeneity. Variance-reduced extensions of the algorithms are also studied. Baseline empirical evaluations of the methods are provided with a three-layer MLP and a ResNet18 on CIFAR-10, hinting that the introduced momentum term does indeed help generalizing on test data.

### Strengths
* **SOTA CV rates:** State-of-the-art convergence rates are obtained for the introduced methods.
* **No data heterogeneity assumption**: The proof technique gets rid of the bounded data heterogeneity assumption, improving theoretical convergence rates and hinting that the method mitigates the impact of arbitrary data heterogeneity.
* **No additional uplink load**: The introduced momentum term is simple, its effect is intuitive to understand, and does not lead to any additional client to server communication.
* **Constant step-size:** If the training is sufficiently long ($R$ sufficiently high), the theoretical analysis allows for a constant step size for the stochastic gradients (contrary to vanishing ones standard in the literature).
* **VR variants:** Variance-reduced variants of the methods are presented and analyzed.

### Weaknesses
* **Algorithm not new**: Contrary to what is claimed in section 3.1 (*"resulting in the new algorithm FEDAVG-M"*), the added momentum is not new: FedCM [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10874.pdf) is exactly the same algorithm as FedAVG-M, although their theoretical analysis does use the bounded heterogeneity assumptions. Comparison with FedCM rates is lacking in Table 1.
* **Surprising rates for the VR variants**: [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-022-01822-7) states that *"every randomized algorithm requires $\mathcal O \left( \frac{\Delta L \sigma}{\epsilon^3} + \frac{\Delta L}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2} \right)$  oracle queries"*, however, the rate reported in Table 1 and Theorem 2 for FedAVG-M-VR seems to improve on this lower bound as a it leads to an oracle complexity of $\mathcal O \left( \frac{\Delta L \sigma}{NK \epsilon^3} + \frac{\Delta L}{\epsilon^2} \right)$. Setting aside the variance-reduction effect of running a distributed algorithm (leading to the $NK$ term), is it normal to get rid of the $\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}$ term or am I wrongly worried ? (This question also holds for the VR version of SCAFFOLD-M)
* **Experiments seem light:** A value of $N=10$ is pretty low for the standards of the literature in Federated Learning (see, e.g., experiments in [1] where a value of $N=100$ is used), especially since a different behavior for the optimization algorithms can be expected at scale in the partial participation setting (see, e.g. [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02079 ) ). Are the runs averaged over several random seeds ?
* **Additional downlink load**: Although no additional client-to-server communication is necessary, the server-to-client communications are doubled in size with the addition of the momentum for FedAVG-M.
* **Lacking discussion on link between $R$ and $\beta$**: While a constant step-size can be considered for sufficiently high values of $R$, the direct corollary is that, before that regime arrives, Theorem 1 sets a value of $\beta=1$, meaning that the theory seems to predict that the momentum could only be used for sufficiently long training. However, experiments in Fig. 2 seem to show that using a momentum would help even if the training stopped early.

### Questions
* Does the performances of adding a momentum scales to settings with greater values of $N$ ? (Or does scaling leads to a collapses as could be observed for SCAFFOLD, see Fig.10 of [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02079 ) )? 
* Although the last sentence of section 1.2 states *"The analysis presented in this work distinguishes from [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15155)"*, [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15155) state in their paper that *"We also hope that our proof techniques can be useful to establish linear speedup for other classes of distributed methods, e.g, algorithms based on local training such as SCAFFOLD and ProxSkip without relying on data similarity assumptions."* Thus, it raises the question: how different is your analysis from [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15155) ?

**Typos:**

* after equation (1): *"represents a~n~ global gradient"*.
* Second line of the proof of Lemma 5: the scalar product seems to be missing a term, shouldn't it rather read $\gamma \langle \nabla f(x^r), \nabla f(x^r) - g^{r+1} \rangle$  ? (this does not impact the following lines)


**Final comment:**

I recognize the interest of the theoretical contributions of this paper, thus, I am ready to increase my score if my concerns concerning the convergence rates and the experiments are correctly addressed.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the FedAvg and SCAFFOLD algorithm in federated learning. In literature, many works that analyze the performance of these two algorithms have to rely on bounded heterogeneity assumptions, which is unrealistic. In this works, momentum methods is employed to solve the data heterogeneity issue in federated learning. Without any other modification on Fedavg and SCAFFOLD, plain SGD with momentum updates can achieve similar convergence rate as literature. Furthermore, this work show that in the setting of partial client participation, momentum update can accelerate convergence.

### Strengths
1. This work overcomes one of the most common problem in FL analysis, the data heterogeneity issue. Although a lot of works in literature analyzes the convergence result of the two algorithm, most of the works have bounded heterogeneity assumptions. This is the most basic problem in FL analysis. This work utilizes momentum method to overcome the difficulty.
2. The experiment result is encouraging and directly validate the theory.

### Weaknesses
The major concern is novelty. FedAvg and SCALFFOLD are well-known methods in FL. Momentum method is also a popular optimization algorithm. Thus the algorithm design lacks novelty. Further, some work has analyzed the performance of FedAvg with Adam update, e.g, Reddi, Sashank, et al. "Adaptive federated optimization." arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00295 (2020). Adam algorithm is closely related to SGD with momentum, thus the proposed analysis lacks novelty.

### Questions
What is the major difference or difficulty of SGD momentum analysis compared to Adam algorithm? Reddi, Sashank, et al. "Adaptive federated optimization." arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00295 (2020)
