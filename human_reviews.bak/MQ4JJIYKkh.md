# Concept Alignment as a Prerequisite for Value Alignment

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 1, 3, 6

## Abstract
Value alignment is essential for building AI systems that can safely and reliably interact with people. However, what a person values---and is even capable of valuing---depends on the concepts that they are currently using to understand and evaluate what happens in the world. The dependence of values on concepts means that concept alignment is a prerequisite for value alignment---agents need to align their representation of a situation with that of humans in order to successfully align their values. Here, we formally analyze the concept alignment problem in the inverse reinforcement learning setting, show how neglecting concept alignment can lead to systematic value mis-alignment, and describe an approach that helps minimize such failure modes by jointly reasoning about a person's concepts and values. Additionally, we report experimental results with human participants showing that humans reason about the concepts used by an agent when acting intentionally, in line with our joint reasoning model.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors analyze the value alignment problem from the conceptual alignment perspective. Inspired by recent theories on the cognitive understanding of users in problem-solving, a framework is proposed to solve the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) problem. The method builds on a bayesian formulation of the learning objective, which considers the conceptual understanding of different users in planning. The experiments are conducted over a simple planning maze, taken from previous works in cognitive science.

### Strengths
The authors address the failure of value alignment in IRL as an issue of concept misalignment. This is a new idea that could lead to potential benefits in learning personalized policies that are aligned with end users' concepts. The paper is well-written and clear and draws this important connection with previous work in cognitive sciences. 

Overall, the idea, while simple, leads to sensible improvements compared to other strategies that are agnostic to users' concepts. The authors verified their method also via user studies which confirms the superiority of the proposed method. Appreciably, the IRL formulation taking into account the user construal attains a higher positive correlation with the human inference reward.

In conclusion, the authors motivate and prove that the integration of the users' construals has its own merits and deserves to be taken into account for future improvements in the setting of IRL.

### Weaknesses
The idea of connecting IRL with a construal model of the user is interesting but by far a milestone proposed in a series of previous papers on the subject. In the related work section, it is mentioned that Ho and Griffiths (2022) treated the problem in IRL. I understand that the fundamental contribution of the paper is essentially introducing (Eq. 3). The user concepts are already known beforehand and treating the hard case, where they are discovered or taken from a potentially big vocabulary, is only mentioned as future work for benchmarking this method. It is not clear what could be potentially cases solved by this approach, which requires more scrutiny. 

Moreover, no details are provided on how Eq. 3 is implemented and the experiments are entirely synthetic, which leaves open how the framework could be adapted and what the impact would be in real-world cases where users' construal may change more. How do you estimate $P(R, \hat T)$? Is it already known beforehand? It is also not entirely clear what concepts $\hat T$ encode, are they semantical concepts related to some properties of the world (specific to one user) or are they just non-interpretable values reflecting the state of the user? Are the user concepts causal in nature, or belonging to some ontology? How is this related to the standard use of concepts in explainable AI, e.g. [1,2,3]?

My feeling is that this work goes in the right direction but lacks a challenging case study for the proposed method which renders the contribution limited for a paper in this venue. It is not mentioned whether the code will be also publicly available.

### Summary
The work motivates the importance of modeling human mental model of the task (or the dynamics function they would use) to generate demonstrations for an agent while the agent attempts to perform IRL. They present this as "Inverse Construal" problem and provide a grid world based example for the same. They argue, citing prior works, that a way human dynamics function may be different from the agent dynamics function is because humans may simplify the dynamics so that they are able to plan / generate demonstrations easily. They conduct a subject study to highlight their arguments for this domain.

### Strengths
The example is helpful in understanding the arguments made in the paper.

The paper presents a useful subject-study that establishes the need for modelling human dynamics along with learning reward models in the context of IRL.

### Weaknesses
It seems that the work is pushing for “IRL agents attempting to learn from human trajectories should take into account human mental model of the task”. There is a considerable body of work that highlights the importance of modelling human mental models for behavior synthesis (as an example [1]) in automated planning. That is, taking into account human mental models (such as the transition function being used by them) for agent tasks like behavior synthesis, goal recognition, intention prediction etc. is already well motivated (and the current discussion seems to rediscover this for IRL).

Even in the context of IRL, the notion of the correspondence problem (see Related work in [4]) is very related here (not discussed in the paper). The key idea is the dynamics of the demonstrations are different than the dynamics of the agent and the mis-match causes issues with leveraging the demonstrations. In this work the mis-match is motivated through a specific situation where the human demonstrator plans on “simplified dynamics“, however the formulation does not make this distinction. With respect to the formulation the authors assume that the demonstrator has a different dynamics $\tilde{T}$ where there is no formal restriction on  $\tilde{T}$ and a loose specification that  $\tilde{T}$ is ”simpler or easier to solve“. Typically correspondence problem has been viewed through the lens that the demonstrations were collected in a different domain and the agent is acting in a different domain (for example demonstrations is a real human providing robot arm movement and the agent is working in a simulated environment), which still satisfies the problem formulation in this paper, that the dynamics are different.

There are missing arguments on what  $\tilde{T}$ can be. For example, it seems that it has to be defined over the same states and actions as the agent dynamics function  ${T}$ (through result in section 3.4 and equation 4). This implies that human mental model (or the dynamics they are using to come up with a plan) cannot have arbitrarily different state representations (which I believe comes from the authors description on “simpler and easier to solve”, but the formalism is unclear from text). 

The example considered by the authors, as I understand, assumes that the demonstrator has a different dynamics function as a consequence of state-aliasing [2, 3] or perceptual aliasing (i.e. they mix up the light blue and blue cells etc.). These concepts are well studied in sequential decision making but the current manuscript fails to make essential connections highlighting limited literature review.

Authors have not reported IRB and subject study details like demographics. I am flagging the work for ethics review.

### Summary
This paper highlights the importance of considering a human's mental approximations (described as "construals") when making inferences about human preferences from their observed behavior.  As humans often rely on approximate models of the real world when planning their actions, evaluating potential preference models under the assumption that they plan under an exact world model may lead to incorrect inferences about their true preferences.  This in turn may lead to misalignment between an AI's future actions and what the human would have expected.

They formalize this problem in terms of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning, where the "true" dynamics of the environment (which the AI knows exactly) are replaced with multiple possible approximations, which are jointly inferred with the reward function encoding the human's preferences.  Their main contribution is a set of experiments demonstrating that their "construal" IRL model matches the inferences of human subjects far better than standard Bayesian IRL in a navigation task where an approximate model leads to behavior that is very different from optimal behavior under the true model.

### Strengths
The primary strength of the paper is in highlighting the importance of concept alignment in efforts to achieve human-AI alignment.  This issue takes on far greater significance today than it did a few years ago, as AI agents trained with human feedback and demonstrations are now widely deployed in the real world.  The work demonstrates that even in simple settings, failure to account for mental approximations can lead to catastrophic misalignment.  The key takeaway is that we must be careful when learning from humans that we account for limitations in the human's knowledge of the world, and how this might affect their behavior relative to their preferences.

The paper also draws important links between existing psychological research on human conceptualization and planning, and the problem of human-AI value alignment.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that there are conceptual barriers to applying the insights of this work to algorithms that scale to real-world problems.  Bayesian IRL can be viewed as a "regularized" form of behavioral cloning, where the preference for policies that are optimal under high-probability reward functions improves generalization from limited amounts of data.  The inference model proposed here retains this advantage because the space of reward functions and concepts is tightly constrained.  Scaled-up, however, both the reward model and the approximate planning model would need to be far more complex, to the point where we would not expect (an approximation of) Bayesian IRL to be any more sample efficient that behavioral cloning with a similarly complex policy model.  Put another way, given enough data and a sufficiently flexible reward model, we would expect "exact" Bayesian IRL to be able to predict human behavior as well as "construal" BIRL, with the difference in sample complexity becoming less significant as we scale up to more complex tasks.

While I wouldn't expect the paper to solve these issues itself, a deeper discussion of these potential limitations would be useful to the reader.  It would also have been nice to see connections drawn between this work and more scalable approaches to learning from demonstration (e.g., Ho and Ermon, 2016)

The other weakness with the work is that the theoretical model is not itself particularly novel.  Essentially they do Bayesian IRL where the parameters of both the reward function *and* the dynamics model are inferred from human behavior.  A number of previous works have used essentially the same model (e.g., Herman et al. 2016)

The authors should reference previous work in this space, and highlight how the motivations of this work differ from those of previous works with similar mathematical models.

### Questions
1. Did any of the human subjects experiments evaluate human inference with a subset of the trajectories?  It seems possible that humans might make the same inferences about preferences and concepts without sufficient examples to rule out alternative hypotheses.  For example, differences between experiments might que them to provide different answers than they did in previous experiments.
2. A minor point, but were any participants rejected because they failed to correctly understand the "notch" concept themselves?

### Summary
The authors look at the benefits of implementing concept simplification strategies into inverse reinforcement learning (this yields "inverse construal").  The key message is that if an IRL algorithms that fail to model what the demonstrator knows risk failing to understand their reward function.  A bound is provided for the gap in performance between a construal-aware estimate and an entropy-regularized one.  The authors demonstrate this issue in a novel synthetic setting and with user-collected data.

### Strengths
**Originality**: To the best of my knowledge, the idea of modeling construals (what the demonstrator knows or is constrained by) is new in IRL.

**Clarity**: The text is crystal clear and very easy to follow.  The examples are well constructed.  All critical steps are properly formalized, and the notation is consistent.

**Quality**: The related work section is very well done.  The experimental setup also seems reasonable -- but I am not an expert, so I wouldn't be able to tell whether there are implicit biases in the data collection.

**Significance**: I think the high-level message is very much important and I agree with it.  I think the message is well worth discussing at the conference.

### Weaknesses
**Clarity**: I am confused about the usage of the notion of "concept" in this context.  In explainable AI, concepts refer to high-level representations (presumably interpretable) of a given input to be explained or otherwise processed.  In cognitive science and logic it has a similar meaning.  Here it is used as a synonym for knowlede or construal.  I would appreciate if the authors could clarify this in the introduction.

**Quality**: [Q1] The single biggest issue with the paper is that it considers only a rather toy synthetic setting.  I am not sure if this is common in the IRL literature.
