# Deep PDE Solvers for Subgrid Modelling and Out-of-Distribution Generalization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
Climate and weather modelling (CWM) is an important area where ML models are constantly being used for subgrid modelling: making predictions of processes occurring at scales too small to be resolved  (Brasseur & Jacob, 2017). In addition to accuracy, these models are relied on to make accurate predictions even on out-of-distribution data and should respect physical constraints  (Kashinath et al., 2021).  While many specialized ML PDE solvers have been developed, these particular requirements have not been addressed so far. The challenge we address in this paper is to build subgrid PDE solvers which satisfy these additional requirements of the CWM models. We propose and develop a novel architecture, which matches or exceeds the performance of standard ML models, and which demonstrably succeeds in OOD generalization.  The architecture is based on expert knowledge of the structure of PDE solution operators which are designed to obey physical constraints and to enforce numerical stability.

### Summary
The authors introduce an architecture to be used for building subgrid PDE solvers. The architecture embeds a discretized Laplacian operator in its convolution filters, which are multiplied by unknown coefficients. The authors apply the method in 1d and 2d linear heat equations and show that the learned model has some zero-shot capabilities for solutions with energy spectra not seen in training.

### Strengths
* The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.
* The proposed technique demonstrate some ability to adapt to data with different energy spectra than those encountered during training.

### Weaknesses
My most fundamental concerns with this work are mainly on the novelty and significance fronts
* The proposed framework does not show enough novelty. The main adaptation in the architecture is simply embedding a discretized Laplacian structure in the convolution filters in order to reduce the total number of parameters in the model. 
* The problem setting is too simplistic to demonstrate significance. The authors exclusively focus on the linear heat equation with nonhomogeneous unknown coefficients, which is nowhere near the complexity of the other problems referenced, including Navier-Stokes and weather/climate. The heat equation has linear dynamics and generally admits smooth solutions, which means errors do not accumulate over time in complicated ways and solution has very little small-scaled features (so that representing the solution/dynamics fields is relatively easy). The claim that it is "complex enough" (page 4 top) is too much of a stretch. It is certainly not evident that the same OOD generalization might be observed on, for example, turbulent flows.

Less fundamental concerns:
* Baselines: FCN should not be considered a valid baseline if the dynamics is known to be local. In addition, the both FCN and ConvN show signs of overfitting, which suggests the architecture/training is sub-optimal. Techniques such as layer/group normalizations and learning rate annealing should at least be considered.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents a PDE method to tackle the OOD problem of subgrid modeling. Here the new method is compared to a FCN and a CNN on a one and a two-dimensional dataset of the heat equation and the performance on OOD cases with respect to the Fourier spectrum.

### Strengths
Originality
First work tackling this problem

Significance
OOD generalization is an important problem in ML and CWM

### Weaknesses
- Not really clear what the ML part is here or if there even is one
- Not clear if this method scales to larger scale problem (which any relevant CWM problem would be)

### Questions
- Abstract should not include references 
- Abstract does not say anything about the type of ML approach that is going to be used, e.g. architecture
- No conclusion section, please add, especially given that there is space left up to the page limit of 9 pages
- It is a little hard to see what the ML or even DL part is here. A graphic showing that would be nice. 
- Not sure if Deep PDE solver is the right term here, there is not any Deep Learning used, if I understand correctly
- Why is OOD in the Fourier space? It would be nice to have an explanation about why this is the relevant OOD case

### Summary
A method is proposed for learning subgrid PDE solvers from gridded data examples. The approach uses a constrained convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate the value of over simpler neural network approaches (fully connected, vanilla convolutional).

### Strengths
- The approach is simple and appears to work in experiments.
- The authors take care to consider the stability conditions.

### Weaknesses
- The paper was hard to follow. 
- Details of the neural network training were missing, including optimizer, learning rate, stopping criteria, and hyperparameter optimization. In the appendix, the authors comment on the learning dynamics but its impossible for such a comparison to be meaningful without details of the learning algorithms.
- I would have liked to see more justification or an experimental ablation study to corroborate the statements in Section 4, including the statement that the identical layers ensures the same physical process between each physical time step and the coefficient bounds truly force the model to find a solution that is constrained physically and has the same benefits of traditional PDE solvers.

### Questions
- In the introduction, what does out of distribution data mean in this context? 
- What is the use case? I understand that this is for situations where the PDE is unknown (Section 3.2), and the training data consists of one (or more?) gridded data example. 
- If we don't know the PDE coeffients anyway, why not just coarsen the training data into the desired grid and learn the PDE coefficients directly?
- Rather than presenting the results figures right up front, it would be helpful to have more motivation for why this new approach is needed.

### Confidence

### Summary
The paper introduce a method to address the subgrid problems: given training trajectory on the find grid, learn a solution operator on coarser grids. Based on four principles: locality, stability, linearity, memory-less, the authors introduce an architecture that respects these principles. Experiments show that the method outperforms FCN and CNNs on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks of heat equation with non-constant coefficients.

### Strengths
Significance: the authors address an important problem in the domain. Also, out-of-distribution generalization is important for neural PDE methods.

Novelty and contribution: the authors develops neural architectures that respect several important physics principles. As is generally known, incorporating more physics knowledge can improve the model's generalization and data-efficiency. The method is to be commended for its consideration of important physics principles.

Clarity: the paper is mostly clear.

### Weaknesses
Generality: one concern I have for the paper is generality. The paper addresses a very narrow problem: heat equation, which is linear, and has specific structures. Thus, the proposed architecture is linear and has specific convolutional kernels, and cannot generalized to other equations. The improvements in accuracy is purely due to the specific physics priors embedded into the architecture, which is to be expected. Overall, the method in its current form lacks generality as a general subgrid method. This aspect could be improved, e.g., by considering a more general approach (or meta-method) that can build physics priors into more general kinds of equations.

Soundness: the paper lacks comparison with some important baselines, e.g., Fourier Neural Operators and U-Net. It would be great if the authors performs experiments on these method, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
