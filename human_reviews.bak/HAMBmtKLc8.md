# Graph Neural Networks on Symmetric Positive Definite Manifold

- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
Geometric deep learning equips graph neural networks (GNNs) with some symmetry aesthetics from its underlying principles, which draw the structural properties of graphs.
However, modeling in Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry, or even their combinations, usually hypothesizes that the graph nodes satisfy the preferred geometric properties, which ignores the actual graph structures.
This prompted us to consider a more solid expression to relieve the above significant hypothesis for the geometric graph embeddings.
In this study, we generalize the fundamental components of GNNs on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, which could be approximately observed by the integration of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometric structures.
This motivates us to reconstruct the GNNs with manifold-preserving linear transformation, neighborhood aggregation, non-linear activation, and multinomial logistic regression, in which the Log-Cholesky metric  derives the closed-form Fréchet mean representation for neighborhood aggregation and computational tractability for learning geometric embeddings.
Experiments demonstrate that the SPDGNN can learn superior representations for grid and hierarchical node structures, leading to significant performance improvements in subsequent classifications compared to the Euclidean and Hyperbolic analogs.

### Summary
The paper proposes a convolutional GNN whose features are represented as a symmetric positive definite matrix and measured by the log-Choleski metric. The Log-Choleski metric allows a closed-form expression of the Frechet mean, which is necessary for the aggregation step of the chosen GNN framework. Prior to this step, the feature transformation is performed by a double product with a learned parameter in the Stiefel manifold. Finally, the nonlinearity step is implemented as a rectification of the diagonal of the lower traingular part of a matrix, somehow modifying the eigenvalues of the matrix. The proposed SPDGNN architecture is compared with other geometric proposals for GNN, showing the performance of the model especially in the case of the airport database and disease.

### Strengths
- The architecture is novel and most of the choices of parametrization of each step are discussed, especially the choice of metrics.

- The ablation study and experiments on classical databases.

- the paper is written with particular attention to the notations necessary to capture the types of representation (SPD, lower triangular, ...)

### Weaknesses
- Missing at least one recent paper on the same topic with equivalent results on the same experiments (Hyperbolic Representation Learning : Revisiting and Advancing, M. Yang et al. ICML'23). Moreover, the numerical results for the methods presented in both papers are consistent, but not identical, with the globally higher performance reported in Yang et al.

- In the same vein, it would be good to discuss why geometric learning seems to underperform on PubMed and Cora and gives scores for other types of GNN on the same experiments (best competitor). A quick search gives scores on PubMed (91.4 points method from 2021) and Cora (90.16 points method from 2020) that are largely superior, with a caveat on the experimental setting.

- The case of edge-features is not addressed

### Questions
- Could a scaling factor be used in conjunction with the Stiefel parameter to give more freedom to the model?

- Is the initial mapping limited to a linear map, what is its influence?

- What is the expressive power of SPD-GNN? 

- Any number of parameters gain compared to other hyperbolic and Riemannian GNNs?

### Summary
This article introduces a new GNN architecture based on the idea that nodes are represented not as vectors but as symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. The authors propose an architecture based on the Riemannian manifold associated with the Log-Cholesky metric. They apply this framework to semi-supervised node classification by defining logistic regression on the SPD manifold.

### Strengths
- The idea of extending embeddings to SPD matrices seems interesting.
- Utilizing the Riemannian framework with Log-Cholesky and logistic regressions on the SPD manifold appears to be a promising approach.

### Weaknesses
- Many of the contributions in this work are, in fact, already present in the literature, but the discussion regarding prior work is insufficient. The feature transformation with Stiefel matrices and the non-linear activation with the "ReLU-like" layer have already been proposed in [3]. However, at the point of defining these layers, the article does not clearly cite [3] as a reference but rather kind of presents them as original contributions. Additionally, the Riemannian/Cholesky approach is directly borrowed from [2], again without clear referencing when introduced. Moreover, there are significant interactions between the approach proposed here and that of [1], which is only discussed in the appendix. It is crucial to compare with [1] in the experiments and position this method in relation to it, as both seek GNNs where nodes are embedded in the space of SPD matrices. Consequently, it becomes challenging to precisely distinguish what constitutes contributions or ideas borrowed from other articles.

- One crucial point that doesn't seem to be discussed is the algorithmic complexity compared to standard approaches. From a memory perspective, the approach seems already highly expensive since each node is represented as a matrix with roughly $n^2$ parameters. Furthermore, in terms of algorithmic complexity, just the aggregation layer requires performing approximately $m$ Cholesky decompositions and computing an outer product with each of the representations (equation 12). So I doubt that this architecture is really applicable. 

- I find that the article is generally quite confusing and not very clear. There are numerous and often ambiguous notations (for example, the notations for the Cholesky map and its inverse are almost identical), making it challenging to read. Additionally, the writing is quite heavy, with many vague and non-rigorous statements that don't convey a clear meaning. Here are a few examples:
  - "many complex graph data exhibit a profound non-Euclidean potential for analysis" (what is a "profound non-Euclidean potential"?)
  - "the SDP manifold [...] captures the hierarchical structure of datasets in hyperbolic subspaces while retaining Euclidean characteristics."
  - "In typical GNNs, a fundamental assumption is implicitly linked to linear classifiers, as they heavily rely on the Euclidean geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$" (this is not true; you can have Euclidean geometry but use non-linear classifiers).

- The experimental setting in the article appears to lack clarity. The reported results include variances, but it's unclear on how many train/test splits these are based, neither if there is any cross-validation. Additionally, it's not specified whether the competing models were retrained for these experiments. If they were retrained, there is no information on how the retraining was conducted. Alternatively, it's unclear whether the performances were directly taken from the original articles. More transparency and details regarding the experimental setup and data handling would be beneficial for readers trying to understand and reproduce the results.

### Questions
The Figure 2 is not so clear; what is $V$ on the Figure ? I assume that the manifold is in green while the hyperplane is in darkgrey, but it is very hard to see this ‘‘hyperplane'' and to interpret it.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for defining graph neural networks that learn representations on the SPD manifold. The authors motivate their choice of the SPD manifold by the fact it exhibits both Euclidean and Hyperbolic geometry.

Starting from the Log-Cholesky metric, the authors derive closed-form expressions for weight updates, neighborhood aggregation (by computing the Frechet mean), and most notably for MLR on the SPD manifold (similar to the very important contribution of Ganea, 2018 that showed how to implement MLR for the Poincare Ball model of hyperbolic geometry).

The authors also propose a new non-linearity for SPD neural networks.

Finally, the authors conduct experiments on common node classification datasets, showing large improvements over previous methods.

### Strengths
The paper presents strong theoretical results, in particular a closed form expression for MLR on the SPD manifold can have impact on other SPD neural network architectures. The exposition is easy to follow, and the mathematics appear sound. Experimental performance shows a significant improvement in some benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper reads well, there are some areas of lower clarity, I recommended proofreading to improve the writing a bit.

The paper does not cite previous work on SPD neural networks, e.g., SPDNet, SymNet, Chakraborty et al., etc. although they bear resemblance in the choice, e.g. of bilinear layers or of a rectifying function that amplifies small eigenvalues.

The experimental evaluation could be improved: Cora and Pubmed are saturated and unchallenging benchmarks, a better choice would be to use some of the more recent OGB benchmarks that come with a standardized evaluation procedure.

### Questions
I might be missing something but why does the choice of n >= p ensure positive-definiteness of the transformed matrices? (page 5)

Can the constraint of orthogonal matrices be relaxed?

With different formulations of the feature transformations and rectifying units compared to previous work, it is unclear whether part of the improved performance comes from these design choices. In the ablation study, can the authors clarify what alternatives were used when "removing" the Stiefel linear layers and the non-linearities? Could the authors compare against existing formulations from the SPD learning literature?

### Summary
This paper proposes to build Graph Neural Networks using the underlying geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices. The main motivation is that instead of working on Euclidean embeddings of graph features, embedding them in more geometric spaces like the Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices (SPD) yields improved performance and richer representations.  

The authors build on the framework of Log-Cholesky metrics that allow for mapping between the space of lower triangular matrices (with positive diagonal elements) and the SPD manifold. This unique decomposition allows for deriving the main components of GNNs like Feature Transformation, Neighbourhood aggregation, and Non-linear activation using specific formulas. The most significant amongst these is neighbourhood aggregation which can be done using a computationally attractive Frechet mean on the manifold. 

Various experiments are reported to demonstrate that they improve upon standard GNN baselines. An ablation study is also reported to show the efficacy of individual components.

### Strengths
- I found the main idea of this paper: using Log-cholesky metric to map between SPD and Positive lower triangular matrix manifold to be interesting. To that aid, the various components (especially the frechet mean reformulation of neighbourhood aggregation) looks reasonable and interesting 
-  The baseline experiments show decent proof of concept.

### Weaknesses
- The exposition of this paper can be significantly improved. I feel a significant lack of overall quality in the structure and messaging of this paper. The abstract is particularly too verbose and unclear.  To this aid, Figures 2 and 3 could be annotated and captioned more clearly to convey the message of the experiment.   
- Some important baselines appear to be lacking like Zhao 2023 and Lopez et al 2021. I am especially critical of the lack of comparison with Zhao et.al 2023 which seems to propose an identical formulation (i.e. GNNs using SPD manifold - but the specific components are different to this paper).
- I miss any comparisons on runtime or complexity with previous methods. Again, Zhao et al 2023 seems significant baseline to compare with and report.

### Questions
Overall I feel this paper is not yet in the form that can be accepted at ICLR. Despite some similar recent works, the main idea is interesting. However, a lack of comparison with these baselines, and below-par overall writing quality makes it hard to promote acceptance at this point.
