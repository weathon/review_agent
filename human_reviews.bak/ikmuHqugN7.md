- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
It has been demonstrated that the training problem for a variety of (non) linear two-layer neural networks (such as two-layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and self-attention) can be posed as equivalent convex optimization problems, with an induced regularizer which encourages low rank. However, this regularizer becomes prohibitively expensive to compute at moderate scales, impeding training convex neural networks. To this end, we propose applying the Burer-Monteiro factorization to convex neural networks, which for the first time enables a Burer-Monteiro perspective on neural networks with non-linearities. This factorization leads to an equivalent yet computationally tractable non-convex alternative with no spurious local minima. We develop a novel relative optimality bound of stationary points of the Burer-Monteiro factorization, providing verifiable conditions under which any stationary point is a global optimum. Further, for the first time, we show that linear self-attention with sufficiently many heads has no spurious local minima. Our experiments validate the novel relative optimality bound and the utility of the Burer-Monteiro factorization for scaling convex neural networks.

### Summary
This paper revisits recent developments which reformulate the training of a two layers neural network into a convex optimization program but are however often intractable computationally. This paper proposes to apply the Burer-Monteiro factorization to such formulations, in order to make them as tractable as the original convex formulation. In some cases, this retrieves the original non-convex formulation, and in some cases (such as for ReLU MLPs) it gives a novel formulation. The analysis includes linear but also, for the first time in the literature, non-linear ReLU networks, and it tackles MLPs, ConvNets, and self-attention networks. The overall result is that such Burer-Monteiro factorization allows to obtain algorithms for training 2 layers networks which are as efficient as their original non-convex formulations, but which can have guaranteed theoretical properties such as a bound on the relative sub-optimality gap. Finally, these developments are plugged into a (tractable)  layer-wise training procedure of (deeper than 2 layers) CNNs, which allows them to inherit from the theoretical guarantees developed in the paper (and empirically, such CNNs are comparable to state of the art training of CNNs in term of test error).

### Strengths
### Originality

I believe this paper is original, since up to my knowledge it is the first one which considers the Burer-Monteiro factorization of the convex formulation of non-linear ReLU two layers neural networks: additionally, in such case the BM factorization differs from the original non-convex formulation, which makes it an original object to study in itself.

### Quality

I believe the work is of quality, with theorems and their assumptions clearly stated, and their detailed proofs provided in appendix. Additionally, the literature review seems exhaustive, and some care was given to the experiments, with the code provided in the supplemental.

### Clarity

I think the paper is clear, with the motivations and main results clearly highlighted.

### Significance

I believe this work is very significant, since ReLU networks (MLPs, CNNs, and self-attention), contrary to linear networks, are actually widely used in the machine learning community. Therefore, I believe the BM formulation obtained in the paper, as well as the theoretical guarantees that follow from it will be of interest to the community. Additionally, the empirical result at the end regarding the training of deeper than 2 layers CNNs is encouraging and hints at the applicability of the results in that paper even to deeper than 2 layers neural networks. Additionally I think that the discussions around the convergence of (S)GD, stationary points, global optima, and the new theoretical developments in the paper related to those issues, will be interesting to the community.

### Weaknesses
I just have a question regarding the paper (see below).

### Questions
It is still a bit unclear to me how the training of the BM factorization for ReLU networks (19) is done in practice: since this is a constrained optimization problem, I guess its training should depart from a simple vanilla, unconstrained GD ? From the experimental section and also after briefly looking at the corresponding code, unless I am mistaken, it seems that training of pure ReLU networks has not been investigated (I think only Gated ReLU and Linear networks were trained in practice ?). Since analyzing (non-gated) ReLU networks are one of the main result of the paper, I think it could have been interesting  (perhaps in Appendix) to just compare in more details, even just on the toy spiral dataset and for 2 layers ReLU MLPs, the training of the BM factorization vs. the original MLP training, since from eq. (19), the two formulations differ, and since BM has some theoretical guarantees which the  original non-convex formulation does not have.

### Summary
The paper considers two-layer neural networks formulated as convex programs, involving minimizing a loss term regularized by some (quasi-)nuclear norm term.

The paper applies the Burer-Monteiro factorization to the neural convex networks, and derives several theorems characterizing local minimizes (Theorem 3.3), duality gap of stationary points (Theorem 3.4), global optimality of stationary points (Theorem 3.5), and similar results for CNNs (Section 3.2) and Multi-head Self-Attention (Section 3.3).

### Strengths
Omitted.

### Weaknesses
- **First of all, there appears to be a mismatch between the title and the actual contents of the paper.** The title is "Scaling convex neural networks with BM factorization". However, I found no experimental evidence showing that applying BM factorization to convex neural networks leads to more scalable implementations. In particular, I think the title would be only meaningful if the paper compares the baseline that optimizes the two-layer networks by gradient descent and presents improvements over efficiency. This mismatch also comes with several claims that seem inaccurate to me or lack sufficient justifications. For example, 
   - *The BM factorization is essential for convex neural networks to match deep ReLU networks.* The paper is limited to 2 layer networks, I am not sure whether it is suitable to generalize to deep networks. Even in the 2-layer case, the BM factorization is not shown to be essential or promising compared to the above baseline.
   - *Without the BM factorization, the induced regularizer of convex CNNs is intractable to compute, and the latent representation used for layerwise learning is prohibitively large.* However, What remains to be justified is this: Why is layerwise training necessary, and why cannot one just train all layers together (as the above baseline)?


- **Second, the theorems seem to be straightforward extensions of prior works (e.g., as the paper mentions, Bach et al. (2008) and Haeffele et al. (2014))** Please compare prior works at the technical level. What's the novelty of the paper at the technical level? Please justify. Maybe it makes sense to make a table for comparison.

Overall, I found the paper is focused too much on writing and rewriting the problems in different ways, without making a special effort to actually solve the problems. Having presented many reformulations, the paper leaves the readers wondering whether BM factorization works or not. In particular, the theorems are weaker than the convex counterparts (the latter guarantees global optimality). If the paper is unable to show BM factorization leads to improvements in scalability or efficiency, the values of the proposed approach would be greatly limited.


Minor:
- In Eq. (1), maybe it would be great to have parentheses for the summation term.
- Sentence below Eq. (5): two "thereby", thereby not reading well.
- The paragraph after Eq. (19): "*While the original convex program is NP-hard*". It is unclear to me why convex programs are NP-hard.

### Summary
This paper proposed a Burer-Monteiro (BM) formulation for convex 2-layer neural network training problems. In particular, the BM formulation for MLP (with linear, ReLU and gate ReLU activations), CNN (with ReLU activations) and self-attention networks (with linear activations) are included.

The convex neural network training problem for linear and gate ReLU activated MLP can be directly solved using polynomial time algorithms such as interior-point methods. However, the problem becomes NP-hard for ReLU activated MLP, CNN and self-attention networks due to the  use of quasi-nuclear norm regularizer, as it is computationally intractable in practice. 

The proposed nonconvex BM formulation turns the quasi-nuclear norm regularizer in convex training problems into a constrained Forbinuous norm, which is computationally tractable. Despite nonconvexity, the authors developed an optimality bound for stationary points in the BM formulation, which upper bounds the optimality gap between the original convex problem and its BM formulation, and, in some cases, is able to provide certification on the global optimality of the given stationary point.

### Strengths
1. The proposed BM formulation provides a computationally tractable way to handle convex neural network training problems that involve quasi-nuclear norm regularizers.
2. This paper is the first to combine BM with convex neural network training, which is an interesting direction.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed BM formulation doesn’t seem to provide any advantages other than dealing with quasi-nuclear norms. As BM requires $m\geq d+c$ to ensure no spurious minima, it increases the number of variables from $dc$ to $m(d+c)$ (for MLP). For linear and gate ReLU activated MLP, it seems like it would be a lot more efficient to directly solve for the original convex problem.
2. The proposed BM formulation for CNN is still not practical as the memory requirement is too high. In fact, the authors adopt layerwise training for solving the BM formulation, which has no guarantee to converge to global optimum.
3. Continuing from 1 and 2. The paper titled “Scaling Convex Neural Network” but it seems like the proposed BM formulation only addresses the intractability of quasi-nuclear norm, it does not reduce the time complexity and the memory requirement for solving the convex neural network training problem. It is questionable that the proposed BM formulation would be scalable to large 2-layer neural networks due to the above reasons.
4. The novelty of this paper is really limited. In particular, this paper is just applying Burer-Monteior to the existing 2-layer convex neural networks, which would be too incremental to be published on ICLR.

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate the architecture of the CNN network used in Section 4.2? Specifically, exactly which “architecture of (Belilovsky et al., 2019)” is used.
2. What is the rate of convergence for solving the proposed BM formulation using GD? Does GD become sublinear convergence when it is close to the optimal due to the ill-conditioning on $U$ and $V$ (using MLP for example, $U$ and $V$ must be rank deficient at optimality due to $m\geq d+c$)?
3. Could the authors provide experimental results on demonstrating the scalability of BM formulation? For example, the time and memory complexity (per iteration) v.s. the number of neurons.
4. Could the authors provide more insight on why it is important to find the global optimum in neural network training? Though the global optimum gives the best training error, it does not guarantee to give the best generalization error. It is entirely possible that the local minimum would have better generalization error than the global minimum. In addition, finding the local minimum is a lot cheaper than solving the BM formulation proposed in this paper.

### Summary
This paper proposes to solve convex formulations of nonlinear two-layer neural networks with Burer-Monteiro factorization, which is known to be computationally tractable for solving convex programs with nuclear norm constraints. It provides theoretical optimality guarantees for two-layer MLPs, CNNs, and self-attention networks. Experiments on FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The topic studied, i.e., scaling recently proposed convex learning methods is interesting and technically challenging.

2. The proposed method is applicable to different convex neural network structures.

3. The proposed method seems theoretically sound.

### Weaknesses
1. I would bring to the author's attention that Zhang et. al. proposed a convex version of MLP [1] and of CNN [2]. In particular, for [2], the framework also imposes a low-rank nuclear norm constraint. In the arxiv version of [2] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01000.pdf), they also provided experiments to the scale of CIFAR-10 dataset, where they also applied low-rank kernel matrix factorization techniques like Nystr¨om approximation,  random feature approximation, Hadamard transform, etc. The discussion on how the proposed method is compared to [1] and [2] should be included at least theoretically, if not experimentally.

2. The authors could include a big O notation analysis on the computational cost to better illustrate exactly how much the BM factorization helps with scaling the method.

### Summary
The paper adds to the growing literature of viewing 2-layer nonlinear neural networks (MLP, CNN, self-attention) as convex programs (sometimes with large parameters) to study stationary points of these programs via tools from convex and SDP optimization. In particular, using Burer-Monteiro (BM) factorization, the authors give a different parameterizations of these convex programs and demonstrate empirically that the new parameterization allows for faster computability. They also provide theoretical guarantees of local minima of BM programs being global minima of the original program and bound relative optimality gap of BM programs.

### Strengths
I believe the paper is highly interesting, novelly applying existing techniques to a new problem and give ample theoretical and empirical justification for the adoption. 
1. BM theory is shown to be flexible for many different architectures, allowing the authors to show no spurious local minima for linear self attention layer. Although I am not an expert in the theory of transformers, I believe this claim is significant if correct.
2. BM factorization provides computable objectives for convex 2-layer ReLU networks and is shown empirically to scale under widely used, simple datasets.
3. If a local minima is obtained, low-rank-ness is sufficient for global optimality.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed BM factorization for nonlinear MLP is nonconvex and it is not certain how to optimize them to obtain local minima (although the authors do provide methods to check optimality and bound the optimality gap to the original formulation)
2. It appears that BM factorization corresponds to the "conventional wisdom" in practical machine learning of "adding another layer" to the model and enjoy nicer optimization landscape. The resulting program, then, is nonconvex (as also pointed out by the authors). In light of this, although the authors provide a small paragraph in page 5 comparing BM MLP to original nonconvex problems, it seems that the formulation in the paper is much closer to this original nonconvex problem (and thus needs further comparison) than to the convex formulation in which the framework is developed.

### Questions
1. How feasible is it to generalize this framework to more than 1 hidden layer?
2. It is hard to keep track of different norm notations at times, so the authors may consider defining all of them at once at least in the appendix. For instance in Lemma 3.1, when R and C are introduced, it's not clear that those are just L^p norm with p = R and C or something else. It's also not clear that ||.||_F corresponds to Frobenius norm or some special norm that comes from the objective function F. 
3. Is there a feasible framework to analyze saddle points of the BM formulation and not just local minima?
