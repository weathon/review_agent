## Abstract
Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we confirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, to demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor

### Summary
In this paper, the authors tackle the challenges in training high-resolution vision transformers. ViTs have quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. Hence, reducing the number of tokens during training is helpful. To this end, the authors proposed Win-Win, an approach that optimizes token selection during training, balancing local and long-range interactions, and is adaptable to various computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation. The Win-Win approach reduces training complexity by using a subset of tokens, denoted as P', during training. This involves masking (discarding) the remaining tokens. This reduces the training complexity from O(|P|^2) to O(|P'|^2), where the size of P' is much smaller than P.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

- The proposed idea is interesting. The authors demonstrated that partial supervision at training time can also work for pixelwise prediction tasks in ViT. 

- Win-Win leads to measured training speedup for high-resolution ViTs.

- Validation results on BDD100K and MPI-Sintel indicates that partial supervision at training time does not significantly impact the performance at test time.

### Weaknesses
- The evaluation appears to be somewhat constrained. High-resolution Vision Transformers (ViTs) possess a wide range of potential applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and serving as a backbone in diffusion models. However, the authors have restricted their analysis to just two representative applications and a limited set of datasets. This limitation raises questions about the general applicability of the proposed method. Specifically, I am keen to ascertain the viability of applying this method to object detection and diffusion models.

- The ablation study regarding window selection is currently lacking completeness. Notably, an essential baseline - random and non-contiguous window selection - has been omitted for semantic segmentation tasks. I am curious whether Win-Win works better than random masking in single-frame applications, though Table 8 demonstrated its effectiveness for optical flow prediction.

- The paper brings to mind GridMask, a well-known data augmentation technique widely applicable in various vision-related tasks. It would be beneficial if the author could incorporate a discussion on GridMask, highlighting the similarities and differences with the Win-Win method. Furthermore, the paper lacks any discussion regarding inference acceleration techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) through token pruning, such as DynamicViT, A-ViT, IA-RED^2, and SparseViT. Incorporating a brief comparison or analysis of Win-Win in the context of these methods would enhance the completeness of the paper.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks, which is computationally expensive. The authors propose a novel strategy called Win-Win, which involves masking out most of the high-resolution inputs during training and keeping only a few random windows~(2 windows are enough). The model can learn local and global interactions efficiently. The proposed strategy is faster to train, straightforward to use at test time, and achieves comparable performance on semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks.

### Strengths
1. Easy to implement: The method is simple and easy to integrate into the dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and binocular tasks like optical flow estimation.
2. Efficient Training: The Win-Win strategy reduces training time by a factor of 4 compared to full-resolution networks. It achieves this by focusing on random windows instead of processing the entire high-resolution input.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of Comparative Analysis: It does not provide a comprehensive comparative analysis with a wide range of existing methods for training high-resolution vision transformers.
2. Lack of Novelty: Masking out image patches is not a new approach in the literature, and it is simple data augmentation tuning to mask out most of them. I highly recommend the authors to do in-depth exploration and analysis of this method.

### Summary
The paper proposes a ViT training strategy that allows plain-ViT to train with high-resolution images with masking, and inference with high-resolution images with a single forward. Specifically, it proposes to keep only tokens from two randomly selected non-overlapping windows at training time for ViT to process. The paper empirically shows the proposed way (win-win) of training ViT achieves better training and inference cost trade-off with comparable performance of training on full-resolution. Experiments are conducted on both monocular task of semantic segmentation on BDD-100k and binocular task of option flow estimation.

### Strengths
The proposes method enables a simple single forward inference process on high-resolution images without performance drop. In comparison to existing approach, most requires extra effort of aligning train and test resolution difference, e.g. aggregating predictions from multiple small patches. 	

The ablation study regarding the window generation strategy is quite extensive, including various ways of choosing windows, how many windows, window size, square or non-square window, etc. 

The paper also extends the approach to optical flow, which requires more specific design of choosing window as two images involved, and the experiments results listed shows its potentials compared to other methods.

### Weaknesses
While the extensive experiments show the two window strategy is the best one with its simple and good performance, some analysis of such strategy/experiment results is missing. For example, in Table 1 right, why using 1021 tokens will drop 0.6 performance to using 1009 is not clear. 

The results from Table 3 indicates the select of window strategy affects a lot for optical flow task, which suggests difficulties of generating to other data/task (search of window is needed).

### Questions
1.	For results in Table 1, row 1 (968 tokens) compare with row 2 (988), using non-square window has a large drop of 1 mIOU, do authors have any insights on that? And for row 5 (1021 tokens), why a 0.6 mIOU drop compared to 1009 tokens, it is because of min window size? 
2.	Table  3 shows larger variance when using different window strategy compared to table 1, any insights for this? 
3.	From Table 3, the best setting is 2 win. 10x10, 4 win. 7x7, then as state ‘using the best settings found previously), to eval on MPI-Sintel’, however, the setting used have different window size, how did the author choose the window size on MPI-Sintel? Does this mean each time, a search of window size is needed when applying to different data?
4.	In table 5, compared to CroCoFlow, which is also the paper’s base method, it has a performance drop, authors states using different backbone (vit-l v.s. vit-base), the comparison of using the same backbone is missing.
