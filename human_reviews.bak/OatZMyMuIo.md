- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Learning generalizable representations for machine learning and computer vision tasks is an active area of research. Typically, methods utilize data from multiple domains and seek to transfer the invariant representations to new and unseen domains. This paper proposes to perform causal inference on transportable, invariant interventional distribution to improve the prediction performance under distribution shifts.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural causal model (SCM) with latent representations to capture the underlying causal mechanism that underpins the data generation process. Subject to the proposed SCM model,  we can perform the intervention on the spurious representations that are affected by domain-specific factors and the latent confounders to eliminate the spurious correlations. Guided by the proposed SCM and the invariant interventional distribution, we propose a causal representation learning framework. Compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches, our method is robust and generalizable under distribution shifts.  Furthermore, the empirical study shows that the proposed causal representation scheme outperforms existing causal learning baselines.

### Summary
The authors propose a domain generalization algorithm motivated by causality. They specify two latent variables $u_x$ and $u_{xy}$ whose marginals can shift between training and testing. Their approach aims to become invariant to the aforementioned latent variables by intervening on their common child $z_s$, which closes the backdoor path between the input and target.

### Strengths
The authors tackle the important problem of DG, and their approach shows promising empirical results. The paper is well-written and clearly motivated. Also, their approach is interesting in that unlike many existing DG algorithms, theirs doesn't use the environment labels.

### Weaknesses
I found three technical issues with the paper. One is a major issue, and two are minor.

1. (Major) The algorithm does not perform its stated purpose of being invariant to shifts in $u_x$ and $u_{xy}$. The predictive distribution in Eq. (2) is not invariant to $u_x$ and $u_{xy}$, since it involves an expectation over $p(z_s \mid x)$, which can shift across training and testing.

2. (Minor) The posterior is assumed to factorize $q(z_c, z_s \mid x) = q(z_c \mid x) q(z_s \mid x)$, which is at odds with the assumed causal graph.

3. (Minor) The authors cite Kivva 2022 to claim that their standard normal prior $p(z_c)$ is a one-component Gaussian mixture, and therefore $z_c$ is identifiable (along w/ the piecewise affine decoder assumption). Calling a standard normal distribution a Gaussian mixture is technically true, but this identifiability argument is a bit tenuous.

### Summary
The work proposes a causal representation learning procedure for domain generalization given data from a single domain.  An invariance relation is derived based on interventions on the spurious representation. The proposed procedure aims to identify the latent causal and spurious representations and then make predictions according to the invariance relation.

### Strengths
1. The representation learning procedure is novel and interesting, especially the interventions on $Z_{s}$.  

2. The method outperforms the baselines by a large margin on the CMNIST dataset.

### Weaknesses
1. The latent confounder $U_{xy}$ is assumed to be discrete, which is restrictive. The dependency between $Y$ and $Z_{s}$ can be more complicated in general. 

2. The identifiability of the representation is a crucial result. From the discussion in Section 4.1, the identifiability results are not trivial. I think they should be written in a formal statement and proved rigorously.

3. A claim is that $p(Y|X,do(Z_{s}))$ is invariant across different distributions due to the removed arrows $U_x \to Z_{s}$ and $U_{xy} \to Y$. However, there is still an arrow $U_{xy} \to Y$, meaning that the marginal distribution of $Y$ can change across different distributions. As a result,  $p(Y|X,do(Z_{s}))$ is not invariant in general.

### Questions
1. Whether the assumption of a discrete  $U_{xy}$ can be relaxed? What are the consequences of a large $J=|U|$?

2. Does the confounder make the invariance fail as mentioned above? 

I may raise my score depending on the response. If the invariance indeed fails, I would recommend rejection.

### Summary
This paper aims to solve the problem of out-of-distribution classification using a causal approach. In the problem setting, the features $X$ are caused by causal latent variables $Z_C$ and spurious latent variables $Z_S$ and are correlated with labels $Y$ through both sets of latent variables. A typical classifier predicts $P(Y \mid X)$, using the correlation through both $Z_S$ and $Z_C$. However, under distribution shift, the distribution of unobserved variables affecting $Z_S$ are changed, so using the spurious latent variables for classification can result in incorrect predictions out-of-distribution. Instead, the paper proposes using $P(Y \mid X, do(Z_S))$ for classification, which severs the correlation between $Y$ and $X$ through $Z_S$ via a causal intervention, thus providing a quantity that is invariant across domains. Estimating this quantity requires learning encoders which map $X$ to $Z_C$ and $Z_S$, a decoder which maps $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ back to $X$, and a classifier $P(Y \mid Z_C)$. This is done by optimizing over a variational bound on the log-likelihood of the data. After training, predictions are obtained by computing a linear combination of predictions from $P(Y \mid Z_C)$ weighted by a value indicating the compatibility of $Z_C$ with $X$ (using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate expectations). Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

### Strengths
This paper offers a novel take on leveraging causality to solve out-of-distribution classification. To my knowledge, there are no works which consider modeling the problem as done in Fig. 1, where $P(y \mid x, do(z_S))$ is used as the classifier. The problem setup has interesting implications in terms of the ways that features $X$ and label $Y$ are related. The experimental results also show promise that the approach is effective in practice.

### Weaknesses
I am concerned about the soundness of some of the claims:

1. The path from $U_{xy}$ to $Y$ is not influenced by any intervention on $Z_s$. Hence, if $p^s(U_{xy}) \neq p^t(U_{xy})$, it should also be the case that $p^s(y \mid x, do(z_s)) \neq p^t(y \mid x, do(z_s))$. This seems to contradict what is stated at the end of Sec. 3.1.

2. It is not clear how calculating the expectation of $p(y \mid x, do(z_s))$ over $p(z_s \mid x)$ (as done so in Eq. 2) is considered marginalizing out $z_s$. It is also not clear why this is preferable to just choosing some arbitrary $z_s$ to intervene.

3. How are $p(u_x)$ and $p(u_{xy})$ modeled in Eq. 3 if they are unobserved and change between source and target?

4. What justifies that the learned representations $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ truly follow the causal diagram in Fig. 1? Given the generative process of learning these representations (i.e. through $q(z_s \mid x)$ and $q(z_c \mid x)$), it could be argued that $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ are caused by $X$ rather than the other way around. Further, it is difficult to believe that a learned representation can contain more information about $Y$ than $X$, but this is what is implied by the graph (i.e. $Y$ and $X$ are independent given $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ but $Y$ is not independent of $Z_S$ and $Z_C$ given $X$?).

In addition, there are a few points that could use more elaboration:

5. At the beginning of Sec. 3.1, it is explained that the consideration of $U_x$ and $U_{xy}$ address two types of biases: selection bias and stereotype bias. This seems to be an interesting point and could be expanded.

6. Under Alg. 1, the paper mentions the necessity of assumptions to compensate for the lack of observations of $Z$ and $U$. These should be explicitly stated, as this seems to be the crux of the reasoning behind why the model works. Further, are some of these assumptions only relevant to certain types of data (e.g. images)?

I cannot recommend acceptance while I have these doubts, but I look forward to having them clarified in the authors’ responses.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the problem of domain generalization, where the target domain datasets are unobserved during the training phases. To solve this problem, the authors propose a structural causal model with latent variables to model the causal mechanism. Sequentially, the authors conduct an intervention on the spurious representations to remove the spurious correlations and further learn the invariant interventional distribution. The authors evaluate the proposed methods on several datasets and achieve ideal performance.

### Strengths
1.	The authors leverage the causal knowledge to address the domain generalization problem.   
2.	The authors evaluate the proposed methods on several datasets.

### Weaknesses
1.	One important issue is the confusedness of the type of variables in Figure 1. In the domain generalization task, the domain labels are usually observed. However, it is unclear if $U_x$ and $U_{x,y}$ are observed variables or not.   
2.	Moreover, the authors mentioned that $P^S(Y|X,do(Z_S))= P^T(Y|X,do(Z_S))$ according to Figure 2(b). But if $U_{x,y}$ is influenced by different domains, the aforementioned equation is not true.   
3.	The proposed causal generation process is similar to that of [1], it is suggested that the authors should provide a discussion between the proposed causal generation process and [1]. Moreover, it seems to be impossible to conduct do-calculus on the latent variables without identification guarantees of the latent variables.
