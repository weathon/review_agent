# Endowing Protein Language Models with Structural Knowledge

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Protein language models have shown strong performance in predicting function and structure across diverse tasks. 
These models undergo unsupervised pretraining on vast sequence databases to generate rich protein representations, followed by finetuning with labeled data on specific downstream tasks.
The recent surge in computationally predicted protein structures opens new opportunities in protein representation learning.
In our study, we introduce a novel framework to enhance transformer protein language models specifically on protein structures.
Drawing from recent advances in graph transformers, our approach refines the self-attention mechanisms of pretrained language transformers by integrating structural information with structure extractor modules.
This refined model, termed the Protein Structure Transformer (PST), is further pretrained on a protein structure database such as AlphaFoldDB, using the same masked language modeling objective as traditional protein language models.
Our empirical findings show superior performance on several benchmark datasets. 
Notably, PST consistently outperforms the foundation model for protein sequences, ESM-2, upon which it is built. Our code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to incorporate structural information into the protein representation learning process. By converting protein structural information into graph structures, the model employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process the structural graph information of proteins. It then integrates the structural representations learned by the GNN with the representations of the ESM-2 model, ultimately resulting in a protein representation that has been enriched with structural information. The paper validates the model's performance on various protein function prediction tasks and compares the impact of different factors such as model size, pre-training strategies, and the amount of structural information on the model's effectiveness.

### Strengths
+ This paper introduces a protein representation learning method that integrates protein structural information with sequence-based models, which has a positive impact on the development of protein representation learning models.
+ The model proposes the direct integration of protein structural information into the pre-trained ESM-2 model, reducing the training cost and resource requirements.
+ The model's performance is validated across various model sizes, revealing insights into the impact of scaling on such models.

### Weaknesses
+ The main reported results in the paper (Table 1), where the model's performance is compared to ESM-Gearnet MVC, show only a slight advantage, and this advantage is likely due to the use of a stronger backbone model (ESM-2 vs. ESM-1b). Therefore, the results may not be very persuasive in demonstrating a good performance improvement for the PST model.
+ The approach of incorporating protein structural information into the ESM model using a GNN has been previously proposed in other papers[1]. While this paper just applies this approach to the field of protein representation learning, it lacks novelty, and it does not discuss the differences between these methods.
+ Table 1 does not report the performance of ESM-2 under end-to-end training conditions, and it does not specify important hyperparameters of the compared models, such as model size, which is a crucial factor affecting relative model performance.

### Questions
+ Has the paper explored the impact of different backbone models on performance? For example, ESM-1b vs. ESM-2.
+ Since there are pre-trained GNN models designed for protein structural graph, such as GearNet[1], did the paper investigate the performance impact of using such pre-trained GNN models?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework, the Protein Structure Transformer (PST), aimed at enhancing the efficiency of protein language models (PLMs) by seamlessly integrating structural information derived from protein structures. Building on the foundation of the ESM-2 model, the PST refines the self-attention mechanism using structure extractor modules and leverages recent advances in graph transformers. 

The model can be further pretrained on databases like AlphaFoldDB, enhancing its performance. An observation in the experiment is that improvements can be achieved by finetuning just the structure extractors, addressing concerns about parameter efficiency.

The PST demonstrates superior performance over ESM-2 in various prediction tasks related to protein function and structure.

### Strengths
1. The authors combine advances in graph transformers with existing protein language models to enhance the performance of protein function prediction tasks, showcasing a fusion of existing techniques to create something novel.

2. The empirical findings presented are comprehensive and demonstrate the PST’s performances on the EC, GO and some tasks from the ProteinShake benchmark, and specially parameter efficiency in training compared to the existing methods.

### Weaknesses
1. While the integration of a structure extractor with a PLM is presented as a unique proposition for function prediction tasks, it exits parallel studies in the protein representation field. For instance, LM-Design [1] proposes a similar structure adapter into PLMs that endows PLMs with structural awareness, and the structure adapter could access an arbitrary additional structure encoder (GNNs, ProteinMPNN etc.). As a result, this might raise concerns about novelty in comparison to existing methods.

2. A limitation in the study is the lack of an empirical exploration regarding the selection of different structure encoder. While the paper presents results based on a specific structure extractor module, it would have been insightful to see comparisons or benchmarks against various other structure encoding methodologies.

### Questions
1. The paper primarily focuses on the integration of a structure extractor with the ESM-2 model. However, with the availability of larger models like ESM2-3b, have there been empirical studies to assess the impact and advantages of the structure extractor? Specifically, as the scale of the PLM increases, does the benefit of adding a structure extractor diminish or remain consistent? It would be crucial to understand the interplay between model size and the structure extractor's efficacy.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper extends a pre-trained protein language model, ESM-2, with information from predicted structures. Architecturally, PST extends ESM-2 by adding a GNN module to the Transformer. PST also includes additional pre-training steps based on predicted structures from AlphaFold. When adapted to a range of downstream tasks, PST outperforms ESM-2.

### Strengths
* The paper is clearly written.
* The experiments attempt to offer careful comparisons with a strong model from prior work, ESM-2. PST outperforms ESM-2 on a range of protein tasks. An improvement can be observed even when only tuning the structure-related parameters.
* The paper offers strong evidence that structural information from predicted structures can offer improved performance. The proposed methods for incorporating structural information seem reasonable.

### Weaknesses
* A controlled comparison between ESM-2 and PST might have considered continuing MLM pre-training for ESM-2 for an equivalent number of steps as PST pre-training. However, the experiments showing that tuning only the structure-related parameters (section 4.4) is sufficient to improve performance partially address this.
* While the improvement from PST over ESM-2 is largest for smaller model sizes, the efficiency improvement is partially offset by the need to predict a structure.

### Questions

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework called Protein Structure Transformer (PST) that enhances transformer protein language models specifically on protein structures, resulting in superior performance on several benchmark datasets. The PST integrates structural information with structure extractor modules, which are trained to extract structural features from protein sequences. The authors evaluate the performance of the PST on several benchmark datasets and compare it to the ESM-2 model. The results show that the PST outperforms the ESM-2 model on several tasks, including protein secondary structure prediction, contact prediction, and remote homology detection.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel framework that enhances transformer protein language models specifically on protein structures, which is an important area of research in bioinformatics.
- The PST outperforms the ESM-2 model on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
- The paper provides a detailed description of the PST framework and the structure extractor modules, which could be useful for researchers interested in developing similar models.

### Weaknesses
- Overall speaking, the novelty of this paper is enough. There are plenty of works that integrated the graph representation in protein representations, even alphafold. The authors mentioned about the minimal training cost and parameter efficient, while I acknowledge the good point. This is hard to be a strong strength. 
- The framework actually is a GIN + ESM model, with the ESM freezed and GIN and head tuned. In Figure 1, however, the GIN is not clearly  presented. If GNN in the figure is the extractor, it means the GNN would be processed multiple L layers, this is somehow not necessary or why for this design?
- Small question, the GIN is randomly initialized, what's the difference between zero-initialized as you mentioned in the paper? Besides, is the node embedding in GIN is initialized by ESM token embedding?
- The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed framework or potential areas for improvement.

### Summary
This paper proposes the Protein Structure Transformer (PST) built on the protein language models (PLM), such as ESM-2, to incorporate structural information into PLM for the purpose of obtaining structural-aware protein representations. It takes the 2D-ordered protein graph as input and devises the structure extractor modules within self-attention architecture. The experiments show its superiority compared to the vanilla PLMs.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents the simple yet effective structure extractor modules to inject structural knowledge into the vanilla sequence-based PLMs, thus enhancing the representation ability of PLMs.
2. The improved performance on several downstream tasks is promising. Especially, the parameter-efficiency Sructrual Only models can match the full model on a variety of tasks, which indicates the PST can serve as the flexible plug-in modules to any PLMs to enhance their representation ability.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper writing style needs to be further improved. The Method spends a lot of pages introducing the principle of ESM-2, which is not the contribution of the paper. On the contrary, the introduction of the PST framework is vague. How the node embedding output by GNN is further incorporated into the residue embedding of the original ESM? Did they just add, concentrate? or viewed as the individual token embedding which is conducted with self-attention to the residue embedding of the original ESM? I highly suggest the authors to add more details.
2. The introduction of structural knowledge of 3D protein structures is limited. This paper just compressed the 3D structures into 2D graphs without considering the 3D geometric features, such as the SE(3)-Equivariant features, which have already been confirmed to be critical in modeling the 3d protein structures or the protein-protein docking patterns by many works, such as Alphafold2, EquiDock, etc. The only considered feature is the distances between nodes severed as the edge attributes while performing less-satisfied on the downstream tasks.
3. The paper only adopts the subset of AlphaFoldDB. I wonder if the author ever tried other structural databases such as metagenomic protein databases predicted by ESMFold? How do the data quality and quantity affect the performance of PST?
4. The downstream tasks adopted in this work are limited. As the protein structure information decides the physical and chemical properties of proteins, the downstream tasks should not only be performed on protein structure prediction tasks, but also on other tasks, like protein solubility prediction,  secondary structural prediction, etc. Like xTrimoPGLM (chen et al. ) and Ankh (Elnaggar, et al) do.
5. Besides the ablation studies claimed in the pre-training strategy, the author should add Seq-only to get rid of the reason solely brought by the sequence-based training.
6. "While PST typically surpasses its base ESM-2 counterpart at similar model sizes, this performance gain tapers off with increasing model size. "Does this observation indicate that if we adopt a huge amount of protein sequence data and also the large scale of PLMs,   the structural knowledge can be well-captured on the sequence-based pertaining, like xTrimoPGLM with 100B dominates on most of the downstream tasks?
7. From the Table.1, although the PST with fixed representation outperforms the GearNet MVC, the end-to-end PST(fintuned) lies behind the GearNet MVC on the fold classification tasks. How to explain this?
