## Abstract
Contrastive learning is a highly successful technique for learning representations of data from labeled tuples, specifying the distance relations within the tuple. We study the sample complexity of contrastive learning, i.e. the minimum number of labeled tuples sufficient for getting high generalization accuracy. We give tight bounds on the sample complexity in a variety of settings, focusing on arbitrary distance functions,  $\ell_p$-distances, and tree metrics. Our main result is an (almost) optimal bound on the sample complexity of learning $\ell_p$-distances for integer $p$. For any $p \ge 1$, we show that $\tilde \Theta(nd)$ labeled tuples are necessary and sufficient for learning $d$-dimensional representations of $n$-point datasets. Our results hold for an arbitrary distribution of the input samples and are based on giving the corresponding bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis/Natarajan dimension of the associated problems. We further show that the theoretical bounds on sample complexity obtained via VC/Natarajan dimension can have strong predictive power for experimental results, in contrast with the folklore belief about a substantial gap between the statistical learning theory and the practice of deep learning.

### Summary
Suppose $V$ is a set of $n$ data points, each embedded into a $mathbb{R}^d$. Suppose we observe $m$ triplets $(x,y,z) \in V^3$ and their labels in $\{ -1, 1\}$ where the label is $1$ if $x,y$ are closer than $x,z$ in the embedding space in $\ell_p$ distance and $-1$ otherwise. The paper gives optimal order for sample complexity $m$ required to get to a misclassification error of $\epsilon$. 

The high level technique is to derive VC dimension (and Natarajan dimension for larger tuples, but we ignore results in the larger tuple case for now). The authors derive nearly tight order for VC dimension of such triplet classifiers. For upper bounding the VC dimension, they formulate the classification function as the sign of a polynomial in $nd$ dimensions. The key ingredient here is a fact from Warren (1968) that there are at most $(4epm/nd)^{nd}$ connected components in $\mathbb{R}^{nd}$ where in each connected component, the signs of the $m$ polynomials are fixed. For proving the lower bound on VC dimension, the authors give a clever construction of a set of triplets which can be shattered.

Authors give their results to realizable and agnostic cases. They extend their results to several distance functions and tuples of size more than 3. They also study the well-separated case where the labeled triplets $(x,y^+,z^-)$ satisfy $\rho(x,z) \geq (1+\alpha) \rho(x,y)$ etc. for some $\alpha > 0$.

### Strengths
* The derivations are interesting, short and non-trivial.
* The results are relevant because contrastive learning is practical.

### Weaknesses
Nothing significant.

### Questions
Typos/Minor comments:
* page 4: Outline of techniques: P is a polynomial of degree $2$, not $2d$.
* Reducing dependence on $n$: It may be good to state bounds with the assumptions mentioned ($k$ latent classes etc.)
* Theorem 3.3 proof, first line: Should it be $d < n$ here?
* In Definition 2.1, the symbol $S_3$ seems to be used before definition.
* Please search for "Kulis Kulis" and "Warren Warren" in the paper and remove such duplicates.
* page 8, second line: Should $<$ be replaced by $\leq$?

### Summary
The paper explores the efficacy of contrastive learning, a method for learning data representations based on labeled tuples that detail distance relationships within the tuples. The main focus is on understanding the sample complexity of this method, which refers to the minimum number of labeled tuples needed to achieve accurate generalization. 

This work provides specific bounds for sample complexity across various settings, especially for arbitrary distance functions, $\ell_p$-distances, and tree metrics. A central finding is that for learning $\ell_p$-distances, a minimum of $\Theta(\min(nd,n^2))$ labeled tuples is sufficient and necessary for depicting $d$-dimensional representations of $n$-point datasets. These results are applicable regardless of the input samples' distribution and derive from bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis/Natarajan dimension of related problems. 

This paper also demonstrates that theoretical boundaries derived from the VC/Natarajan dimension correlate strongly with experimental outcomes.

### Strengths
1. This paper primarily studies the sample complexity of contrastive learning, and provides tight bounds in some settings, including arbitrary distance functions and $\ell_p$-distances for even $p$ and almost tight bounds for odd $p$. For constant $d$, this work also provides a matching upper and lower bound. 
2. This paper studies both realizable and agnostic settings, as is standardly considered in PAC learning. The sample complexity bounds in terms of $\epsilon$ coincide with the standard results in PAC learning in both realizable and agnostic settings. 
3. The proposed proof idea extends to various settings, including the cases where $k >1$ (multiple negative examples in one tuple) and quadruple samples.

### Weaknesses
1. It would be good to provide a thorough comparison with the known sample complexity bounds that appeared in the existing literature. 
2. While I understand the page limit of the main body, there seems to be relatively less than enough content on the main results of this work in the main body. Perhaps consider moving more technical parts from the appendix into the main body. 
3. The structure of the paper could be reorganized a bit: e.g., the paragraph "Reducing dependence on $n$" could be part of the discussions after presenting the full main results.

### Questions
1. What do you think is the primary season/insight that the upper bounds for $\ell_p$-distances are different between odd and even $p$?
2. Do you think it is possible to characterize the sample complexity bound when the cardinality of $V$ is infinite? 
3. Minor:
- In the paragraph "Outline of the techniques" on Page 4, why "P is some polynomial of degree $2d$"?
- In the paragraph above "Outline of the techniques" on Page 4, $(x_1^-, x_2^-)$ ->  $(x_3^-, x_4^-)$?

### Summary
Given labeled sample $(x_1,y^+_1,z^-_1),\ldots,(x_n,y^+_n,z^-_n)$, the goal of contrastive learning is to create a distance function $\rho$ such that $\rho(x,y) < \rho(x,z)$. This study comes in theoretical flavour, providing lower and upper bound for sample complexity of contrastive learning via PAC-learning framework. The main ingredient of the proof of the bound is the Natarajan dimension (which is a generalization of the VC dimension) and the results from Ben David et al. (1995).

### Strengths
- The study covers a wide range of distance functions, both in lower bounds and upper bounds.
- Interesting use of an algebraic geometry result to prove the upper bound.
- The theory is well-supported by the empirical results.
- The authors discuss possible directions for future work.

### Weaknesses
Personally, I find it hard to follow the results by chapter. For example, Section 3 should be all about the bounds in $\ell_p$ norm, and so Theorem 3.1 (Arbitrary distance) should come before this section. And I think it would be easier to follow if Section 3 is only for $k=1$ and Section 4 is only for $k>1$.

I have some comments for Table 1:
- I would put "$(1+\alpha)$-seperable $\ell_2$" in the same category as $\ell_p$.
- The "Same" labels for quadruplet learning and $k$ negatives have different meaning; while the former refer to all distance functions above, the latter only refers to the $\ell_p$ distances. Could the authors modify the table so that this distinction becomes clearer?

### Summary
This paper studies the sample complexity of contrastive learning, which learns the similarity (usually the distance in a metric space) between domain points, given tuples each labeling a most-similar input point to a given point (anchor).

This paper proves matching (or some almost matching) bounds on the sample complexity for contrastive learning of different metrics (arbitrary distance, cosine similarity, and tree metric), with generalization to learning with hard negatives (separated $\ell_2$ distance), quadruplet learning, or learning with $k$ negatives.

The results are based on an output-based assumption: there is an embedding into a $d$-dimensional vector space. This enables reasoning on the VC/Natarajan dimension to study the PAC learning framework, both for the realizable and the agnostic cases, to get non-vacuous PAC-learning bounds with predictive powers.

The proof is on representing the decision boundary of contrastive learning under such metrics as a low-degree polynomial, and upper bounding its number of possible satisfiable sign changes (Lemma 3.5 proved in Section B), hence the largest shattered set of tuples, and VC/Natarajan dimension.

The theoretical result is also experimentally verified on popular image datasets (CIFAR-10/100 and MNIST/Fashion-MNIST), by learning the representations with a ResNet18 trained from scratch with different contrastive losses.

### Strengths
The proof is by _understanding the problem via transforming it_ to another equivalent representation: the decision boundary of contrastive learning under common metrics as a low-degree polynomial, and bounding its number of possible satisfiable sign changes. There is no loss until invoking the algebraic-geometric bounds on number of connected components by Warren, and the sample complexity bounds on Natarajan dimension by Ben David et al. 

And at a high level, the paper shows that when the learned representation is expressive enough (such as ResNet18), PAC-learning bounds (e.g., by VC/Natarajan dimension) can have predictive powers.

The theoretical result is also experimentally verified on popular image datasets (CIFAR-10/100 and MNIST/Fashion-MNIST), by learning the representations with a ResNet18 trained from scratch with different contrastive losses (Appendix F).

### Weaknesses
The proof arguments are somewhat non-constructive, due to using a counting argument/pigeonhole principle, and hence while the theory may explain certain observations (e.g., the experimental results in Appendix F), it is unlikely to give effective learning algorithms and the constants in the resulting bounds are unlikely to be sharpened. This may be nitpicking, but are weaknesses nonetheless.

### Questions
While the experimental results (in Appendix F) verify the growth of error rates as predicted by the theory for ResNet18 on certain parameter ranges, there is not much explanations regarding, e.g., what representations (e.g., deep learning architectures) are expressive enough to achieve the sample bounds as predicted by the theory. That is, the representations (given by the theory) are somehow non-explicit/ineffective, is that the case?
