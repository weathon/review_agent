## Abstract
Integrating a notion of symmetry into point cloud neural networks is a provably effective way to improve their generalization capability. Of particular interest are $E(3)$ equivariant point cloud networks where Euclidean transformations applied to the inputs are preserved in the outputs. Recent efforts aim to extend networks that are equivariant with respect to a single global $E(3)$ transformation, to accommodate inputs made of multiple parts, each of which exhibits local $E(3)$ symmetry.
In practical settings, however, the partitioning into individually transforming regions is unknown a priori.
Errors in the partition prediction would unavoidably map to errors in respecting the true input symmetry. Past works have proposed different ways to predict the partition, which may exhibit uncontrolled errors in their ability to maintain equivariance to the actual partition. To this end, we introduce APEN: a general framework for constructing approximate piecewise-$E(3)$ equivariant point networks. Our framework offers an adaptable design to guaranteed bounds on the resulting piecewise $E(3)$ equivariance approximation errors.
Our primary insight is that functions which are equivariant with respect to a finer partition (compared to the unknown true partition) will also maintain equivariance in relation to the true partition. Leveraging this observation, we propose a compositional design for a partition prediction model. It initiates with a fine partition and incrementally transitions towards a coarser subpartition of the true one, consistently maintaining piecewise equivariance in relation to the current partition.
As a result, the equivariance approximation error can be bounded solely in terms of (i) uncertainty quantification of the partition prediction, and (ii) bounds on the probability of failing to suggest a proper subpartition of the ground truth one.
We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of APEN using two data types exemplifying part-based symmetry: (i) real-world scans of room scenes containing multiple furniture-type objects; and, (ii) human motions, characterized by articulated parts exhibiting rigid movement. Our empirical results demonstrate the advantage of integrating piecewise $E(3)$ symmetry into network design, showing a distinct improvement in generalization accuracy compared to prior works for both classification and segmentation tasks

### Summary
The paper proposes a new neural network design that approximates piecewise E(3) equivariance. This design allows to segment better deformable or movable objects such as human body parts or objects in a 3D scene.

### Strengths
I believe this paper tackles a relevant problem, piecewise network equivariance. A solution for this problem will partially solve some open problems in 3D scene understanding such as 3D scan segmentation or instance segmentation by design of the network.

Moreover, the solution proposed is simple and easy to implement: Initialize the network with an initial partition, use E(3) equivariant layers to process the parts, and then use a clustering algorithm to determine the new set of parts from the predicted features.

### Weaknesses
Although I liked the paper and the proposed solution, I believe the paper was very difficult to follow and needs an improved evaluation. In the following paragraphs, I listed some of the things that were unclear to me, maybe I did not fully understand these parts, and some points on how to improve the evaluation of the paper:

- It was not clear to me the statements at the end of section 2.3. How $\sigma \rightarrow 0$ makes $\lambda (Q^{pred}) \rightarrow \lambda (Q^{simple})$ ? There is no control over the features that come out from the previous layers and the clustering obtained can be worse than $Q^{simple}$ as defined later in the paper, farthest point sampling with KNN. I suppose here $Q^{simple}$ refers to the random uniform partition and not the Voronoi partition used later. If this is true, later I would not refer to the Voronoi partition as $Q^{simple}$.

- Moreover, how sigma is defined to achieve the desired number of parts (number of group truth parts)? How robust is the proposed method to different choices of $\sigma$?

- Maybe I missed it, but I think $\delta$ is never properly defined. Moreover, Fig.1 is not helpful unless more context is given. What Fig. 1 illustrates?

- In the Training details paragraph, $Y$ is used to refer to part centers but in the Q Prediction paragraph is used to refer to per-point features. In this same paragraph, the centers are referred as $\mu$ instead. Moreover, $\pi$ is never defined. From the formulas, I suppose it refers to the per-point weights of each of the Gaussians in the GMM.

- In Training details, it is not clear how the loss would work. $Y_{GT} \in R^{n \times d}$, but $Y_l \in R^{k \times d}$ if they are the part centers as the text indicates. Moreover, is each layer supervised by this loss or only the last one?

- In network architecture, it is not clear which network architecture is used. First, it indicates that PoinNet is used but later SpareConv layers are used. From the appendix, I believe all layers are PointNet layers, but I don't understand where the SparseConv layers come into play.

- Regarding evaluation, I believe it needs significant improvement before publication. Here is a list of possible experiments that would help improve the evaluation:
	- Comparison with different choices of sigma in the layers.
	- Visualization of the intermediate partition assignments will help understand the behavior of the model.
	- Experiments on other datasets, such as ShapeNet part segmentation and real 3D scans such as ScanNet.
	- Several relevant baselines missing. Only one global rotation equivariant network is used in the comparisons, Vector Neurons. It would be necessary to compare to network architectures that are locally equivariant such as E2PN, LieConv, or simple graph convolution networks. It is not relevant to show improvement over basic point architectures such as PointNet or DGCNN.

### Summary
This paper introduces a general framework called APEN for constructing an approximately piecewise-E(3) equivariant neural network for point clouds. The model is then used for classification and part-segmentation tasks on two datasets: scans of human objects performing various sequences of movements and room scans of furniture-type objects.

### Strengths
- Errors that arise when maintaining equivariance of point clouds are unavoidable in practice. The model presented in this paper can be employed to control these unavoidable errors. To the best of my knowledge, there have been very few works in the literature that can address this problem. This model can also be seen as a generalization of classical global E(3)-equivariant point networks when the error is set to zero.
- The presented model is constructed in such a way that it can ensure equivariance of partitions of the point clouds, which is more challenging than achieving global equivariance.
- The paper includes a detailed theoretical analysis with useful intuitive explanations.
- The model performs well in the two experiments.

In general, I believe this is a noteworthy paper.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical explanations in the paper are somewhat challenging to comprehend. For example, why the indicator $\lambda(Q)$ in Eq. (2) can be used to measure the probability of drawing a bad partition from a non-proper subpartition of $Z_*$. The rationale behind defining $Q_{simple}$ in that manner and the behavior of the number $\lambda(Q_{simple})$ as $k$ tends to $n$ also need further clarification.
- The approximation error defined in Definition 1 depends on $M$ which is an unknown and possibly large number. Therefore, it is unclear how this approximation error can be employed to control the errors occurring in experiments. For example, given a positive number $\epsilon$ how can we design the model in a way that the approximation error does not exceed $\epsilon$?
- PointNet and DGCNN are non-equivariant models. Therefore, it may not be fair to compare the proposed model with them. Instead, it would be interesting to assess the efficiency of the proposed model compared to other equivariant models for point clouds, with suitable modifications to make them equivariant for partitions of the point clouds.

### Summary
This study aims to extend global E(3)-equivariant point networks by introducing support for multiple components, each subject to its local E(3) symmetries. Prior approaches have unbounded errors when their partition predictions diverge from the actual data. To address this, this paper proposes a framework called APEN to construct approximate piecewise-E(3) equivariant point networks, which offers guaranteed bounds on the resulting approximation errors.

In particular, the APEN model starts with a detailed initial partition and gradually merges these partitions into larger segments in successive layers. The efficacy of this method is validated through tests on 3D scans of interior spaces and human movement patterns.

### Strengths
- This paper tackles an important problem: modeling local symmetries for point networks. Previous work provided no guarantees on the approximation error when the predicted partitions are inconsistent with the true partitions.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is a bit hard to follow in general. I think the introduction should provide more high-level pictures and intuitions without talking about technical details. Also see questions.
- The baselines used are PointNet, DGCNNs, and VectorNeurons, while this work focuses on local symmetries. It would be useful to discuss how previous methods that extend global E(3) point networks to handle local symmetries perform on these tasks. While the authors likely don't need to run experiments for the rebuttal, it would be good to hear their rationale for choosing these particular baselines over other more directly relevant work.

### Questions
I think I don't fully understand this work so I can't make a good judgment yet. It would be greatly appreciated if the authors could clarify the following questions:
- Page 2, what exactly is defined as "equivariant approximation error"? What is the relationship between this and general approximation error? The sentence "this simple model enables bounding the equivariance approximation error solely by the probability of drawing a 'bad' partition. Crucially, this bound is independent of any required restriction on the resulting piecewise equivariant model function bounded variation." is difficult to follow in the introduction without more context, before read all the theorems and technical details afterwards.
- Equation 2, as I understand it, as long as the two partitions are inconsistent, | $||ZZ^T - Z_{\ast}Z_{\ast}^T|| > 0$, even if $Z$ is a finer partition of $Z_{\ast}$? Is that correct? If not, can you explain why?
- Theorem 1, is it possible the $\arg\max$ would give a set rather than a single value (i.e. ties)? Would that cause any problems?
- Table 1, can the authors discuss why the performance of vector neurons are so bad, even compared to baselines?
