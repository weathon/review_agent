## Abstract
Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation could be useful for gaming, film industry,
and AR/VR applications. However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the
room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room.
To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which is able to generate con-
vincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just
a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing opera-
tions such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is
to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method con-
sists of two stages, a ‘Layout Generation Stage’ and an ‘Appearance Generation
Stage’. The ‘Layout Generation Stage’ trains a text-conditional diffusion model to
learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next,
the ‘Appearance Generation Stage’ employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a
vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt.
In this way, we achieve a high-quality 3D room with convincing layouts and lively
textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the
generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expen-
sive editing-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more rea-
sonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.

### Summary
This paper proposes a controllable method for room-scale text-to-3D meshes: it first utilises scene layout generation diffusion model to generate 3D scene layouts from text prompts, and then generates panorama given rendered semantic layout as conditions. With this design, it could control the object arrangements  of generated 3D meshes, and it is easy to edit the generated 3D meshes ad hoc.

### Strengths
1. Adding controls into scene-scale 3D generation is a promising direction, and this paper gives the first several attempts to solve it. The whole pipeline is reasonable  and sound. 
2. The editing experiment is impressive and interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The variety of generation. Since both scene generator and controlnet are trained on Structure3D dataset, which contains only "living room" and "bedroom", I am concerned the variety of scenes this method could generate. I am also curious about how does it work on some other rooms, like "bathroom", "kitchen" and others?
2. Text prompts are strange.  The text prompts shown in this paper are not very natural. For example, " the living room has eight walls,. The room has a picture, a shelves and a cabinet".  These prompts are very different from prompts people typically use to describe the rooms. I am curious about how it works with  more natural and rand descriptions? Like "a living room with a cozy, yellow coach and red curtain" and others. 
3. Related to point 2,  the given prompts specifies the number of walls in the room. Is it necessary to specify the wall numbers to get good results? What is the quality of scene generation? Are the number of walls generated the same as number in text prompts? Counting the number of wall instances in generated layout and comparing to numbers in text prompts might be an  interesting metric to look on. 
4. Not a weakness but some citations are missing:
[1] CC3D: Layout-Conditioned Generation of Compositional 3D Scenes
[2] RoomDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis with Coherent Geometry and Texture

### Questions
1. To measure the variety of generations, it might be helpful to also report the FID/KID on scene layout generations, as DiffuScene, which could be a reflection about scene layout variety.
2. More results on diverse prompts would be more convincing, including (1): prompt style: removing xx walls, adding more adjective and using more natural language; (2) trying contents beyond "living room", "bedroom".

### Summary
The paper proposes "Ctrl-Room," a method for text-driven 3D indoor scene generation. The authors present a two-stage approach where the room layout is first generated from text input and subsequently used to guide the appearance generation. The primary insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance, which facilitates manual editing of layouts. Experiments are conducted primarily on the Structured3D dataset, demonstrating the method's potential in generating detailed, editable, and consistent 3D rooms from natural language prompts.

### Strengths
(+)  The intuitive approach of generating the layout first and then the appearance allows for fine-grained control over the generated scenes, enabling easy human intervention in editing the layout.

(+) The method, to some extent, avoids problems faced by existing methods, such as generating multiple beds in the same room, ensuring more realistic scene generation.

(+) The paper introduces the concept of loop consistency sampling, ensuring that the generated panoramic images maintain their cyclic consistency, especially at the edges.

### Weaknesses
(-) The method heavily relies on 3D bounding box annotations. Given the scarcity of datasets with such 3D annotations, the generalization capability of the text-to-layout process is limited. The experiments are restricted to generating only living rooms and bedrooms, without exploring the generation of other room types.

(-) As mentioned in the appendix, the current approach can only generate textures for a single panoramic image. It doesn't support multi-viewpoint generation, which limits the visual quality when the viewpoint is freely moved.

(-) The results for the layout generation stage lack sufficient evaluation and comparison, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the first stage in isolation.

### Questions
- In the first stage, all objects are represented using cuboid bounding boxes. How does this representation impact objects with a more "concave" shape like tables or desks? In these cases, the projected semantic mask would differ from the actual silhouette, how might this affect the ControlNet's performance in the second stage?
- In section 3.3, under "Optimization Step," the designed optimization target seems to only allow for object movement and scaling. Does the method support other types of edits?
- The paper doesn't demonstrate the visual quality of the generated geometry/mesh. What is the quality of the generated geometry, both in terms of accuracy and visual appeal?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to generate 3D rooms from text. The proposed method separates the generation of layout and appearance into two stages. In the first stage, a text-condition diffusion is trained to obtain the scene code parameterization. In the second stage, a fine-tuned ControlNet is utilized to generate a room panoramic image. The experiments demonstrate they can generate view-consistent and editable 3D rooms from text.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method can locally control the 3D room generation, which can generate plausible indoor scenes.

2. The proposed method separates the layout generation and appearance generation.

3. The proposed method can achieve 3D indoor scene editing.

### Weaknesses
1. There are two diffusion models, which will lead to both large computation costs and GPU memory costs.

2. Although the rendering views seem better, the geometry seems worse than the MVDifffusion based on Figure 5.

### Questions
1. Figure 5 shows that the proposed method generates obviously worse results on the left walls compared to MVDiffusion. How did the user study show better results in Table 1?

2. The global consistency seems guided by the generated layout. How does the proposed method guarantee plausible consistency for the layout generation? For example, how does the proposed method guarantee two objects are not cross-overlapped?

### Summary
This paper proposes a two-stage generative modeling method for indoor scenes. In the first stage, the scene code is generated according to the text prompt, and then the scene code is converted into 3D geometry with bounding boxes with semantic class labels. The rendering of semantic 3D indoor scenes is used to generate panorama images as the texture of the indoor scene. Overall, I feel that this paper is a system work that applies diffusion models and control net to the task of 3D indoor scene generation.

### Strengths
1. The experimental results are impressive.
2. The two-stage design ease the editing of the generated 3D indoor scenes.

### Weaknesses
Lack of technical novelty.  Although two-stage design has its own advantages, it is more like a design strategy than a solid technical contribution, since such design is widely used in 3D content generation. For instance, visual object networks first generate geometry through a shape network and then generate rendering results through a texture network.

### Questions
I can still find some artifacts in the generated 3D rooms, such as the distortion of textures. Scene code is an approximation to the real geometry, is it possible to add another stage to convert it into freeform 3D surfaces that are ubiquitous in indoor scenes?
