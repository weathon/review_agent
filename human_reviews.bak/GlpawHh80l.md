## Abstract
Consider a $K$-vertex simplex in a $d$-dimensional  space. We measure $n$ points on the simplex, but due to the measurement noise, 
some of the observed points fall outside the simplex. The interest is vertex hunting (i.e.,  estimating the vertices of the simplex).  The successive projection algorithm (SPA)  is one of the most popular approaches to vertex hunting, but it is vulnerable to noise and outliers, and may perform unsatisfactorily.  We propose pseudo-point SPA  (pp-SPA) as a new approach to vertex hunting. The approach contains 
two novel ideas (a projection step and a denoise step) and generates roughly $n$ pseudo-points, which can be fed in to SPA for vertex hunting. For theory, we first derive an improved non-asymptotic bound for the orthodox SPA, and then use the result to derive the bounds for pp-SPA.  Compared with the orthodox SPA,  pp-SPA has a faster rate and more satisfactory numerical performance in a broad setting.  The analysis is quite delicate: the non-asymptotic bound is hard to derive, and we need precise results on the extreme values of (possibly) high-dimensional random vectors.

### Summary
This paper consider recovering the k-vertex simplex. Exploiting the idea of K-nearest neighbor, this paper improves the SPA algorithm (Araujo et al. 2001) and propose pp-SPA (shown in Algorithm 2).  Compared with the analysis in Gilis and Vavasis, this paper obtain some improvements as in Theorem 2 and Theorem 3.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a novel algorithm to reconstruct the k-vertices and analyze its performance. The analysis seems to be solid. Compared with the prior work (Gillis and Vavasis), improvements are obtained under certain scenarios.

### Weaknesses
+ This paper seems to be a incremental work based on Gillis & Vavasis (published in 2013).  

+ There is only limited numerical experiments to validate the peformance of the proposed algorithms. (c.f. Figure 2).

### Questions
1. Will more samples contribute to the reconstruction performance? My intuition is that the reconstruction performance will improve with more observations, that is, the reconstruction error will decrease with an increasing sample $n$. However, the relation between sample number $n$ and the reconstruction error is largely missing. 

2. How is the algorithm compared with the matrix completion solution? To be more specific, we can stack the observations and obtain the sensing relation $X = V\Pi + N$, where observation $X_i$ is the $i$th column of matrix $X$, and $N$ is the sensing noise. Easily, we can verify that $V\Pi$ is a matrix with rank at most $K$. Hence, we can view matrix $X$ as a linear combination of low-rank matrix and noise matrix. Then, we exploit the research on low-rank matrix reconstruction and solve the problem. 

3. In comparing the performance between Theorem 1 over Lemma 4, what if we have $\gamma(V) \ll s_{K-1}(V)$? In such case, lemma 4 may be more tight then Theorem 1.

### Summary
The *main problem* tacked by the reviewed paper is the **vertex hunting**, i.e.:  the estimation of $K$ vertices defining a simplex in $\mathbb{R}^d$ given $n$ sampled points belonging to the simplex perturbed by iid zero-centered Gaussian noise with variance $\sigma$.  The discussed problem is essential in many problems in ML/data analysis, e.g.: hypespectral unmixing, archetypal analaysis, and community detection in networks, topic modelling in NLP.

The *main innovation* is the *pseudo-point successive projection algorithm* (pp-SPA), which is the improvement of the well studied SPA method that is simple and effective. The proposed innovation consists of two parts: (i) in applying PCA to estimate the K-1 dimensional linear subspace defining the simplex (ii) to perform K-nearest neighbours averaging on the points. Both of these actions are meant to help with denoising of the given sample points and to help with correct estimation in high-noise settings.

The *main contribution* of the paper, apart from proposing the two denoise methods to SPA, comes from the supplied theoretical analysis. The authors show an upper bound on the error that depends on $K-1$th singular value of the matrix formed by the concatenated sampled points $X = [x_1,x_2, \ldots x_n]$. This is a contrast to the existing bound that includes $K$th singular value in the work of (Gillis & Vavasis, 2013) that proved the first recovery bounds for the basic SPA algorithm. The authors claim that this is a significant difference, especially since the sampled points are guaranteed to lie in a $K-1$ lin. subspace, thus the $K-1$th singular value is bounded away from zero, while the $K$th singular value is not.

The *numerical comparisons* with the basic SPA and the related ablation studies are provided in the text and show benefits of the proposed methods in the specific cases of small $d=2$ and $K=3$, however, other situations of interest when the denoise function can be more pronounced, e.g., when d >> K is not showed. 

The proofs seem to be technically involved, but it is difficult for me to check the soudness of the results as I am not an expert in the area.

### Strengths
I believe, the paper brings potentially several strong contributions:
1) The authors propose algorithm seems to practically make a lot of sense
2) The theoretical results are novel and non-trivial. The authors exploit the specific Gaussianity of the noise to be able to derive these bounds
3) The experiments are limited, but they support the statements of the paper

### Weaknesses
There are some considerable difficulties I have with the paper:
1) The writing and the structure of the text should be improved. For example:
* It is not clear to me what the illustration in Figure 1 shows? Is it obvious that one of these is better and what does ``idea simplex'' denote?
* At times a statement is given without citation, e.g. you say in "Our contributions.", pg 2  that: "since the SPA is greedy algorithm, it tends to be biased outward bound.", but it is not clear where this can be seen.
* It is very difficult to follow the motivation of Theorem 1, and how it shows that the previous results of (Gillis & Vavasis, 2013) is non-satisfactory. It is very difficult to see the comparison with the bound in (5) for $\beta_{new}$. 
2) The numerical experiments are done only for very small sizes. I am not sure how big is the effect of denoising using low-dimensional PCA projection in this case.

### Questions
* How does the theory differ in the case of 3-simplex in 2D? Is there a difference in the $K$ vs $K-1$ singular value?
* How does the algorithm perform for higher dimensional problems?
* In the second sentence on the first page you state that Gaussian assumption can be relaxed. Can the theory by applied also when the errors are not Gaussian?

### Summary
The paper describes an algorithm for the vertex hunting problem. In this problem, one is given a set of points from a given simplex that underwent some noise. The goal is to identify the simplex, i.e., to find its vertices. A previously known algorithm for this problem is SPA, which repeatedly chooses the largest sampled point as a vertex, then projects the remaining points to its orthogonal space. 

This paper proposes a different algorithm, which is more appropriate for handling noise. 
The algorithm first identifies a subspace in which the simplex might exist, and projects the points to this subspace. 
Then, a denoising step eliminates "outliers". 
Finally, standard SPA is applied to the remaining points. 

The paper evaluates this method both theoretically and experimentally.
On the theoretical side, the paper introduces an improved analysis for classic SPA, and shows further improvement is achieved by their method (pp-SPA). 
Here, performance is measured in terms of the maximum distance between an estimated vertex and a matched actual vertex (for the best possible matching). 
On the experimental side, the paper compares pp-SPA to standard SPA, as well as variants that use only some of the steps in pp-SPA (only projection and only denoising), and shows that pp-SPA achieves the best reconstruction error.

### Strengths
The paper gives ample motivating examples for which the problem is relevant. The paper makes attempts to motivate the given bounds. The algorithm itself seems intuitive.

### Weaknesses
The bounds given in the paper, e.g. Theorem 2, are very complex; they contain multiple terms and are subject to many conditions. It is hard to understand whether those conditions are restrictive, or whether the bounds are significant. 
I think the presentation of the problem could be expanded upon.

### Summary
Fix a dimension $d$, and let $r_1, ..., r_n$ be $n$ vectors that lie on the same $K$ dimension simplex with extremal vertices $v_1, ..., v_K$, where $1\leq K \leq d+1$. The authors consider the (practical) problem of having noisy realisations $X_i = r_i + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i$ is some Gaussian noise.  This Gaussian noise assumption can be relaxed; the authors don't explain how, but looking at the proofs, I don't doubt that claim. 

We are interested in writing each $r_i$ as a linear combination of $v_1, .., v_K$. This would ofcourse be trivial if we have access to $r_1, ..., r_n$, because we can find the extremal vertices $v_1, ..., v_K$, and then the problem amounts to solving a linear system of equation. Unfortunately, we only have access to the noisy $X_1, ..., X_n$, so finding the extremal vertices is not possible. Intuitively, we want to solve a linear system "approximately". 

The existing algorithm for this problem is called SPA, or the successive projection algorithm. The algorithm starts with an empty extremal set K. at iteration $k$, given the current residual space, the algorithm projects all the points to the compliment of the previous residual space, then adds the vertex that maximizes the Euclidean norm greedily to the extremal set. 

The authors claim that the current SPA algorithm has an issue of being biased outward bound. To counter this, they do a few contributions (in the paper):

1) They introduce a new practical variant of the classical SPA algorithm, pp-SPA. This algorithm has two steps. First, it uses the fact that the points $r_1, ..., r_n$ lie on the same $K-1$ dimensional hyperplane $H$. So they project the noisy readings $X_1, ..., X_n$ onto the plane that minimizes the least square error with respect to the noisy realizations. Next, it "averages" each point using KNN to create more robustness and crease "pseudo-points". This is where the pp term in the algorithm name comes from. The algorithm seems to do better in practice.  

2) The authors tighten the non-asymptotic bound for the classical SPA result from depending on $O(1/s_k^2)$ to $O(1/s_{k-1}^2)$ where $s_k$ is the $k$-th largest Eigen value of the extremal vertices $v_1, ..., v_K$. They also a similar bound for pp-SPA.

### Strengths
I like the pp-SPA algorithm a lot, and it feels like a very natural idea. It's an added bonus that the authors were able to get tighter theoretical bounds, which while admittedly are too complicated sometimes to compare fairly to classical SPA, are clearly tighter. It's not clear to me at all when the bounds for pp-SPA beat the bounds for classical SPA, simply because of how complicated the bounds are. 

I was able to follow most proofs as a non-expert, so the **proofs** are well written (the actual writing is a whole other story, see below). The analysis for the SPA algorithm is a bit gross; I spent several days following the proof, it felt like a nightmare. I don't claim I understand all steps there, but otherwise the proof looked kosher to me. Perhaps spend some time on simplifying it, but that's easier said than done. 

Overall, I think that together with the new practical and nice pp-SPA algorithm that clearly does better in practice from the experiments, and the new non trivial theory to back it up, the paper is above acceptance threshold.

### Weaknesses
1) For some reason, the authors do not compare pp-SPA with any robust SPA. I found many results in the literature on robust SPA, so it seems bizare it is not included in the experimental section here. Please try to include at least one robust variant of SPA/similar algorithm in the experimental section. 

2) The writing can be dramatically improved. See below minor points, but if this is accepted, please spent a few iterations on improving the writing. It's extremely terse at time. 

3) You reprove several "elementary" results that I am almost certain must exist in the literature. Please don't do this, and spend some time to search for the result you need and cite appropriately. You don't need to prove everything from first principles! For example, Lemma 1 can be given as a HW question for an honors linear algebra class.... 

4) The statements of Theorem 2/3 are an absolute nightmare, and I struggle to see how anyone would cite/use your result without a ton of heavy lifting in understanding your proofs.

Minor comments: 

Page 2 "and so on and so forth" Akward, please change. 

"However, since the simplex lies on a
hyperplane of (K − 1)-dimension, it is inefficient if we directly apply SPA to X1, X2, . . . , Xn"  This needs more explanation

"The results suggest that the SPA may be significantly
biased outward bound, and there is a large room for improvement" No! This result suggests that SPA is biased outward bound for this example! Why would this suggest it is a general phenomenon?! Actually, how do you know your own algorithm doesn't display this phenomenon for other examples?


"he triangles in black, green, and cyan are the true simplex (which is a triangle since (K −1) = 2), the simplex estimated by SPA, and the simplex estimated by D-SPA (D- SPA is a special case of pp-SPA where the projection step is skipped and pp-SPA is a new approach to be introduced; see below), respectively." Rewrite this sentence! 


Page 2 "Roughly say" --> Informally, ...


"successive projection algorithm (SPA) (Ara´ujo et al., 2001)" The "term" successive projection algorithm might've originated from the Araujo paper from 2001, but I can't believe that this algorithm was first discovered in 2001. To start off, it has similarities to the Frank-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm, and several polyhedral algorithms. Can you please verify where the original **idea** was derived, to keep historical accuracy? 

Lemma 1 (Best-fit hyperplane) There is no way this result isn't known. I can literally prove this result without even looking at your Appendix with Lagrangian multipliers and straightforward linear algebra identities. Please search for where this result was first proved, and don't reprove old things unless your proof is starkly different (which is absolutely not the case here)
