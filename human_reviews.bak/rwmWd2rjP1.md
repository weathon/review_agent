# Molecule Relaxation by Reverse Diffusion with Time Step Prediction

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Molecule relaxation---finding the stable state of an unstable configuration---is an important subtask for exploring the chemical compound space, for instance, to identify novel drugs or catalysts. Existing methods rely on local energy minimization with the gradients (i.e., force field) estimated through computationally intensive ab initio methods or approximated by a neural network trained on large expensive datasets encompassing \emph{labeled stable and unstable} molecules. In this work, we propose molecule relaxation by reverse diffusion (MoreRed), a novel purely statistical approach where unstable molecules are seen as \emph{noisy} samples to be denoised by a diffusion model equipped with a time step predictor to handle arbitrarily noisy inputs. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo energy surface instead of the complex physical energy surface and is trained on a significantly smaller dataset consisting of solely \emph{unlabeled stable} molecules, which is considerably less expensive to generate. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate its competitive performance to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of the quality of the relaxed molecules inferred. Furthermore, we identify the high potential that time step prediction has to enhance the performance of data generation, where our findings are promising both in molecular structure and image generation.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the molecule relaxation task and proposes a method entitled MoreRed, where unstable molecules are seen as noisy samples to be denoised by a diffusion model equipped with a time step predictor to handle arbitrarily noisy inputs.

### Strengths
1. I appreciate the presentation of the paper; it is well-organized.
2. The research problem is highly relevant to the ICLR community.
3. The method is well-motivated.
4. The experimental results are significant.

### Weaknesses
1. I believe that the idea of using diffusion in this paper is quite straightforward and not very innovative, so I find this aspect lacking in novelty.
2. The proposed "Diffusion Time Step Prediction" seems to have a loose connection with the main task of molecule relaxation studied in the paper. The authors also mentioned that it appears to be a generic technique that could be applied in other domains like image generation.

If this paper solely relies on diffusion to address the molecule relaxation task, I think it lacks significant innovation. Furthermore, the "time step prediction" aspect doesn't seem closely related to the main task.

### Questions
The paper uses PaiNN as the backbone and compares it with force field (FF) methods also based on PaiNN. I would like to see the authors try using other different backbones to evaluate the robustness of their proposed method concerning the choice of backbone.

### Summary
The authors propose a diffusion model to find stable molecular structures. When using it, instead of starting with a normal distribution, it becomes a reverse diffusion process from any unstable structure to a stable structure. Therefore, the critical technical contribution is to use a network that determines the corresponding diffusion time step for the input unstable structure.
In the experiments on QM7-X, the proposed method outperforms L-BFGS using a force field in thems of relaxed structure reproduction.
In addition, they show that diffusion time step prediction is empirically effective for molecule and image generation.

### Strengths
* The proposed method can learn only from stable structures, so the required training data is much smaller than ML force fields. I think this advantage is significant when the training data is collected by a more accurate but heavy QM method, such as CCSD(T).
* The diffusion time step prediction is a novel trick for reverse diffusion from non-gaussian input. 
* The readers can see the feasibility of the diffusion time step prediction via the experimental results in Figure 2 (Right).

### Weaknesses
* The application of the proposed method needs to be described so that the impact of this method is not clear.   I would like to see how the proposed molecule relaxation can be used in chemistry or biology.
* The proposed method is 10 times slower than the structure optimization using a force field model.
* It needs to be explained why the RMSD ratio, the RMSD after relaxation divided by the RMSD of the unstable initial structure, is used for the comparison. I am worried that the proposed method can be only accurate for initial structures near their relaxed structures. 
* No explanation why the diffusion time step prediction is also helpful for unconditional generation from normal distribution prior.

### Questions
* What is the application of molecule relaxation without energy/force prediction? I guess you have some assumptions about applying the proposed method, but it is not described in the main text.
* How long does it take to find the relaxed structure from an initial structure? Is 0.05s * 1000 (MoreRed-AS) vs 0.03s * 118 (FF model) correct?
* Could you provide RMSD instead of RMSD ratio for Figure 3a?
* Is it possible to output the energy or force of stable structures? It extends the applications of this method, such as crystal structure predictions. If the energy prediction head is added to the proposed method, Matbench Discovery[1] can be a good platform for evaluating the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper proposes to formulate molecular relaxation as a statistical learning task, defining a diffusion process that goes from unstable molecules to stable ones. This is in contrast to most state-of-the-art techniques that try to imitate the physical forces that drive this process in nature.

### Strengths
- Using a diffusion process for molecular relaxation is novel and creative.
- The problem is described in a very easy-to-understand and intuitive manner and the connection to diffusion modeling is well made.
- The authors have written a great background on diffusion modeling.

### Weaknesses
- The parameterization of the noise process is simple Gaussian blurring. It is not clear if this is a realistic assumption. It might be the case that this method wrongly describes molecules as stable when they are unstable, just because it is unable to identify the presence of Gaussian blurring.
- In the second paragraph of page 8, the authors mention that adding their synthetic noise on stable molecules causes force field methods to not be able to optimize the molecules to their stable starting point, whereas their diffusion model is able to perform this. However, this is not a valid benchmark, since the force field methods are supposed to predict forces on physically plausible molecules whereas the diffusion process that the authors have designed makes no guarantees about the plausibility of the molecules. This experiment can be reframed to show a weakness of the proposed method, in which unphysical starting points still become "stable", which should not be the case.
- Similar to the criticism above, I don't believe that the time step prediction performance as reported in section 4.1 is relevant as independent Gaussian noise on the atoms is somewhat easier to predict than stable vs unstable molecules. Since QM7-X contains unstable structures as well, a better approach would be to see the correlation between the time step predictions of the network versus the ground truth RMSDs.
- The test runs should be done with a few different random seeds so that we see how much of a discrepancy exists between runs for this method, as it is statistical in nature.

### Questions
- How does the time step prediction compare to non-fixed variance approaches such as [1] and [2]? It seems very similar to the approach taken there, why not mention how your work is different?
- Dataset scaling is frequently mentioned as a benefit to this method, although it seems that with larger datasets, the probability that some of the modes of the mixture of Gaussians you use as your prior distribution would get mixed. That is, once you add some noise to some training structure $y_i = x_i + \epsilon$, then you might have the issue that for some $j \neq i$, $||y_i - x_i|| > ||y_i - x_j||$. Is this a problem? 
- For table 1, there are many methods that generate molecules on QM9, why not report some of those results as well?

### Summary
In this work, the authors studied a crucial problem in molecular modeling, molecule relaxation, via the methodology of generative modeling. Instead of learning a force field model to conduct simulation for molecule relaxation, the authors proposed MoreRed, which directly models the Boltzmann distribution of equilibrium molecular structures and also learns a diffusion step predictor for relaxation. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of MoreRed on molecular relaxation tasks.

### Strengths
1. The molecule relaxation task is of great interest to chemistry, biology and other scientific communities.
2. The proposed approach seems to be novel compared to previous approaches.

### Weaknesses
- **Regarding the evaluation settings**: As stated in Section 4.2, the authors use the QM7-X dataset to evaluate the molecule relaxation performance. The unstable molecules in this dataset were generated by sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of the stable molecules. The confidence of such data generation procedure is in doubt: (1) In real-world applications, given a molecule, we usually use either random conformation sampling or cheap conformation optimization (e.g., empirical MMFF) to obtain initial molecular structures. The authors should further clarify whether these generated unstable molecules in QM7-X match the real-world settings. (2) Beyond the small organic molecules, molecular relaxation is widely used to investigate the equilibrium state of molecular systems like the adsorbate-catalyst complex or protein-ligand complex. There exist large-scale benchmarks that are more related to real-world settings like Open Catalyst Project (IS2RE and IS2RS tasks). It would be more convincing to verify the proposed methods on these challenging tasks.
- **Regarding the generality of the proposed methods**: As a general framework, the proposed MoreRed can use different equivariant backbone models. Given the rich literature of equivariant networks, it would be more convincing to verify the generality of MoreRed with different architectures.
- **Regarding the compared baselines**: For molecule relaxation tasks, the authors only compare the proposed three variants of MoreRed with corresponding NN-based Force Field models on the RMSD metric. For the machine learning based molecule relaxation approaches, there indeed exists strong baselines like [1], and there also exists generative models capable of transforming one data distribution to another data distribution that also lie in the settings of the molecule relaxation tasks [2]. It would enhance the quality of this paper if the authors could provide further discussions and comparisons to these approaches.
- **Regarding the quality of unconditional generation**: I do not quite grasp how the diffusion time step predictor improve the unconditional generation quality. Moreover, the experiments also lack strong and advanced baselines [3,4,5].
