- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6

## Abstract
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have exhibited promising performance in solving sequential decision-making problems. By imitating few-shot examples provided in the prompts (i.e., in-context learning), an LLM agent can interact with an external environment and complete given tasks without additional training. However, such few-shot examples are often insufficient to generate high
quality solutions for complex and long-horizon tasks, while the limited context length cannot consume larger-scale demonstrations. To this end, we propose an offline learning framework that utilizes offline data at scale (e.g, logs of human interactions) to facilitate the in-context learning performance of LLM agents. We formally define LLM-powered policies with both text-based approaches and code-based approaches. We then introduce an Offline Data-driven Discovery and Distillation (O3D) framework to improve LLM-powered policies without finetuning. O3D automatically discovers reusable skills and distills generalizable knowledge across multiple tasks based on offline interaction data, advancing the capability of solving downstream tasks. Empirical results under two interactive decision-making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop) demonstrate that O3D can notably enhance the decision-making capabilities of LLMs through the offline discovery and distillation process, and consistently outperform baselines across various LLMs with both text-based-policy and code-based-policy.

### Summary
This paper provides O3D (Offline Data-driven Discovery and Distillation), a new prompting method for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to solve decision-making tasks. The main idea of O3D is to use offline trajectory data to improve a base prompt for a LLM agent. To do this, the paper reformulates a LLM-based policy p(a | tau) as a LLM-based policy parameterized by prompts LLM(a | tau; prompt). More specifically, O3D discovers primitive skills from offline trajectory data by using a LLM, and construct a skill-conditioned prompt. Then, O3 distills improvement tips from offline trajectory data by using a LLM, and improvs the base prompt by conditioning the distilled tips. In summary, O3D consists of three stages: (1) offline skill discovery and data segmentation, (2) offline policy improvement with distilled improvement tips, and (3) hierarchical policy execution. Providing experiment results on ALFWorld and WeShop, this paper shows that O3D can provides better success rate than ReAct, a recent representative method.

### Strengths
- S1. The proposed idea of improving a base prompt for a LLM agent by using offline trajectory data is interesting. Especially, it is interesting to use a pair of high/low reward trajectories to automatically generates improvement tips by using a LLM.

- S2. This paper provides two alternative methods: (1) text-based policy and (2) code-based policy. Also, it provides a comparison between them.

### Weaknesses
- W1. Since this paper combines many techniques such as skill-conditioning in a prompt, prompt refinements by improvement tips, and code-based policy, it is rather hard what is the main contribution. If the main contribution is to improve a base prompt by using textual tips, how does O3D differ from recent works like Reflexion? 

- W2. One of main concerns on this paper is experiment. Since this paper compares O3D with only one baseline (i.g., ReAct for text-based policy and Demo2Cod for code-based policy), it is hard to properly assess the performance. For example, there are more recent works such as Reflexion for text-based policy. It is highly required to add more recent works and properly compare O3D with them. Also, the ReAct paper provides its performance by using PaLM and text-davinci-002 (GPT-3). However, this paper provides results based on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. This mismatch makes the comparison more difficult. 

- W3. According to Table 1 and 2, code-based policy does not work well in WebShop. This result does not seem to support that O3D consistently outperforms baselines in both text-based policy and code-based policy across various LLMs.

- W4. The proposed method seems more suitable for ALFWorld than WebShop. I am not sure that O3D is generally applicable to diverse environments.

### Questions
- Q1. Regarding W1, how does O3D differ from self-refinement works like Reflexion?

- Q2. Regarding W3, how does the skill discovery work for WebShop?
   
- Q3. What are the details of O3D-Human?

### Summary
This paper proposes an offline in-context learning framework. It composes three main steps: 1). the agent learn from a large set of offline logs to segment and discover sub-tasks; also generate various skills/sub-tasks based dataset; 2). from the offline dataset, it asks to model to summarize valid primitive actions, and using trajectory contrasting for generating important tips; All of these will be used as prompts for sub-skill policies; 3). it utilizes few shot prompting to compose these policies and interact with the downstream task.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes an interesting idea about how to effectively distill the knowledge from offline datasets into LLM, w.o. expensive finetuing. ICL can only distill several examples through few-shot due to limited context length. The idea of decomposing tasks, learning task-specific prompts via summarizing primitive actions and extracting valid tips using offline dataset to improve the policy is interesting.

- The proposed method is also validated empirically via its superior performance on ALFWorld, WebShop, compared with other multi-step reasoning methods, such as ReAct.

- The paper is very well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- One thing is not super clear is the effectiveness of each stage of the pipeline. For example, in the skill discovery skill, give the huge amount of offline dataset, probably with noise, there might be hallucinated skills, how this approach effectively handles this and selects the important/valid skills that will be used in downstream tasks. Beyond this, in the second stage, how is the LLM's performance is doing the sub-trajectory extraction? It would be great to provide this more fine-grained analysis to understand the limitations and effectiveness of different stages.

- Another question that I am curious is that how is the trajectory contrasting compared with RLHF? Given a fixed set of contrasting trajectories, it would be more effective to prompting the models to extract general tips, or it would be great to distill the knowledge using RLHF?

- For stage 2, how many samples are used to generate primitives as well as distilled tips? And how the positive and negative examples sampled in learning the tips?

- Could you comment more on the effectiveness of self-learned tips generated using Step 2 and human-generated principles? It would be great to list some scenarios on where the self-learned tips is much better.

### Summary
The paper proposes a three-stage approach for offline policy improvement with knowledge distillation of LLMs through discovering reusable skills and distilling generalizable knowledge across multiple tasks based on offline interaction data.
The experiment uses three GPT models and official human demonstrations as success data, and a set of failure data generated by using ReAct on the training task set introduced in the original ALFWorld and WebShop implementations. The results show that the O3D framework outperforms baseline methods in two challenging benchmark domains, and achieves few-shot generalization to various types of tasks with a single set of prompts.

### Strengths
1. Unlike simple behavior cloning of expert trajectories in certain scenarios, the paper proposes a novel three-stage approach for offline policy improvement with knowledge distillation, which can improve the performance of large language models in solving complex and long-horizon tasks. 
2. The experiments show improvement compared to previous baselines, the authors also conducted ablation studies to show the effectiveness of each stage in the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper only compared with ReAct on textual action approaches, while the offline dataset is collected by sampling trajectories with ReAct. Hence, it's reasonable to see significant improvement given the proposed knowledge/skill distillation procedure. I'm wondering if there are similar approaches that could take successful/failed experiences into LLM's memory to improve the policy itself, for example, Reflexion(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366.pdf), will you compare your method with it?
I also have similar concerns about lacking baselines on code generation approaches.
2. The O3D Human baseline sounds tricky since humans can give almost as good knowledge of skills and primitives as LLMs'.
3. I'm not sure why unifying textual action generation and action with code generation can be a contribution, can you show me why this is of great importance and what is the challenges of unifying these two approaches?

### Questions
1. As the author mentioned: 'The proposed framework unifies two common approaches of LLM-based decision-making which is textual action generation and code generation.', I'm not very clear why unifying textual and code action generation is important, though the authors mentioned the advantages of both generation formats.
2. In the pseudocode of algorithms 2 and 3, I'm wondering how to implement the 'segment process' in order to segment them based on skills, is this process also done by the LLMs?
3. Why in Alfworld GPT3.5-0613 is much worse than GPT3.5-0301?
4. For 'Trajectory Contrasting', how to choose trajectories for the LLMs to compare, do you pick similar trajectories or randomly sample the trajectories to compare?
5.  In this paper, the authors argue that one of reasons that skill distillation and tip distillation are important is due to the lack of context length, since the experiments are conducted with GPT4. I think maybe some experiments with GPT4-32k should be conducted to see what will happen when only prepending sufficient long history in the prompt and comparing the results with the proposed framework.
