# Simple Data Sharing for Multi-Tasked Goal-Oriented Problems

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Many important sequential decision problems -- from robotics, games to logistics -- are multi-tasked and goal-oriented. In this work, we frame them as Contextual Goal Oriented (CGO) problems, a goal-reaching special case of the contextual Markov decision process. CGO is a framework for designing multi-task agents that can follow instructions (represented by contexts) to solve goal-oriented tasks. We show that CGO problem can be systematically tackled using datasets that are commonly obtainable: an unsupervised interaction dataset of transitions and a supervised dataset of context-goal pairs. Leveraging the goal-oriented structure of CGO, we propose a simple data sharing technique that can provably solve CGO problems offline under natural assumptions on the datasets' quality. While an offline CGO problem is a special case of offline reinforcement learning (RL) with unlabelled data, running a generic offline RL algorithm here can be overly conservative since the goal-oriented structure of CGO is ignored. In contrast, our approach carefully constructs an augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP) to avoid introducing unnecessary pessimistic bias. In the experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm can learn near-optimal context-conditioned policies in simulated CGO problems, outperforming offline RL baselines.

### Summary
This paper tackles Contextual Goal-Oriented  (CGO) problems, which generalizes the goal-oriented (GO) setting and considers a context variable (e.g. natural language instructions) which specifies a particular goal in a multi-task RL setting. They propose Simple Data Sharing (SDS) which can provably solve CGO problems by utilizing (1) an unsupervised dataset of transitions and (2) a dataset which additionally includes context-goal pairs. SDS first defines an action-augmented MDP which resolves the inconsistent dynamics in the two datasets and where the optimal policies are also optimal in the original CGO. Then, they propose a data augmentation technique for integrating the two datasets in a principled manner, where this process can be used as a preprocessing step before running offline RL algorithms. Their approach is evaluated on AntMaze.

### Strengths
1. The offline CGO problem is important and timely given the current trend of integrating natural language, foundation models and RL, where large-scale robotics datasets have already started to be released (e.g. RT-X). 
2. The authors propose a simple and theoretically sound technique for augmenting the unsupervised dataset of transitions and supervised datasets with context-goal pairs. This setting is well motivated in real-world applications where the unsupervised datasets may be easier to obtain.
3. The connection between the original offline CGO problem and the action-augmented MDP is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. As the authors themselves outline in the conclusion, only AntMaze was considered. While I appreciate that the authors were open about the limited experiments, I think comprehensive experiments are something necessary to establish the strength of SDS rather than it being a “interesting future direction” As a comparison, MAHALO considers more settings on MuJoCo (D4RL datasets) as well as MetaWorld.
2. While it is true that unsupervised datasets such as task-agnostic play data can be easier to obtain than supervised datasets, SDS requires the dynamics of the dataset to cover goal-reaching trajectories. This is essentially suggesting that SDS always requires optimal trajectories, since we can just add a goal-reaching indicator at the last step of that trajectory even if it is unsupervised initially. This assumption may not scale to more complex GCRL problems if the goals are harder to reach and only near-optimal agents can achieve that goal.
3. The introduction motivates SDS by claiming that Offline GCRL algorithms such as GoFar (Ma et, al. 2022) “can fail when the predicted goal is not reachable from the initial state.” However, this claim is also not evaluated in the experiments. Overall, there are a lack of baselines which were included in the related work section but not compared in the experiments. 
4. Similarly, MAHALO was not considered as a baseline for the experiments although it was compared to SDS in the theoretical results.
5. While the theoretical results in Theorem 3.1 are nice,  it is not immediately clear what the novel contributions are. While I am not too familiar with the literature on statistical RL and I may be missing something, I think the authors should be explicit about what novel techniques are used to extend theorems from previous work, especially if the theoretical results are the main contribution of the paper.
6. (Minor) The indices for theorems in the Appendix and main text are not aligned and there are no references e.g. Theorem B.11 and Theorem 3.1.

### Questions
1. What Is the main difficulty in obtaining negative data (context-non-goal pairs) which is described as a limitation of MAHALO? What makes the unsupervised dynamics data easier to obtain?
2. Please clarify the points raised in the Weaknesses.

### Summary
This work introduces the concept of Contextual Goal Oriented (CGO) problems, which are a specific type of multi-task decision problems that involve reaching goals while following instructions. The authors propose a framework for designing agents that can solve such tasks by leveraging unsupervised interaction data and a supervised dataset of context-goal pairs. They demonstrate that their approach outperforms traditional offline reinforcement learning methods in simulated CGO problems, providing near-optimal context-conditioned policies.

### Strengths
The application of a relatively simple technique for contextual multi-task offline RL, alongside existing offline RL methodologies, is highly valuable. Additionally, the theoretical analysis of performance in this context is solid.

### Weaknesses
The applied assumptions in the paper are quite strong, and the experimental validation of the proposed methodology is limited. Consequently, it is challenging to determine whether the proposed approach would work in more complex and practical scenarios.

### Questions
Is it possible to generate policies for achieving any arbitrary goal state, and if so, what are the principles for generalizing across different goals? Given a limited set of goal contexts, what needs to be learned to derive action plans for arbitrary goals? If so, does this study propose a specific model structure or learning technique for learning such information?

It seems that the scope of the problem addressed in this research is quite limited. Can the proposed methodology be applied to other problem classes that are more general in nature?"

### Summary
This paper considers a setting of contextual goal oriented problems, where the agent has access to an unsupervised transition dataset and goal context-state pairs. The authors develop a simple data sharing (SDS) method after constructing an augmented MDP with the auxiliary state and action. Theoretical analysis of a variant employing SDS is provided to show its optimality. Experimental results on established AntMaze datasets also show the effectiveness of SDS+IQL compared to designed baselines.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces the contextual goal oriented (CGO) problem, which may shed some light on practical problems in robotics or navigation, as illustrated in the introduction, where the task-agnostic data and context-goal mapping are collected separately. 
2. The proposed approach of simple data sharing tackles this problem in a pre-processing way that can be integrated with off-the-shelf offline RL methods. 
3. The authors analyze the theoretical effectiveness of SDS+PSPI and provide a strong performance of SDS+IQL mainly in the AntMaze environment with different levels of context distributions.

### Weaknesses
1. Although some discussions are involved in the introduction, I think this paper still lacks explanations about the CGO setting. I doubt the coexistence of separate unsupervised data and context-goal data might not be so difficult to combine. For example, in the navigation setting mentioned by the authors, it is easy to derive a goal position from the actual state and vice versa. With a predefined context distribution, we can label a state accomplishing a given context as the goal state with ease.
2. In Section 3.1, the authors see the key problem that "some $s\in G_c$ in the $D_\text{goal}$ dataset is also observed in the dynamics dataset." However, I speculate that the process of Algorithm 1 cannot tackle this issue as the transition of a goal state $x$ to $x'$ where $x' \neq x^+$ will still remain. The problem can only be alleviated with the mentioned apporach of "equally balancing the samples $\bar{D}_\text{dyn}$ and $\bar{D}_\text{goal}$" (in section 3.2). 
3. A confusing point is that the authors provide theoretical analysis on SDS+PSPI but do not use this variant for experiments (they use SDS+IQL instead).

Some minor issues:

1. In Line 7 of Algorithm 1, should the created transition here be incorperated with $a$ rather than $a^+$? Otherwise I do not observe any usage of $a$ from unsupervised data.
2. In the "data assumption" part of Section 2, the definitions between $\mu_\text{dyn}(s, a, s')$ and $\mu_\text{dyn}(s' \mid s, a)$, and between $\mu_\text{goal}(s, c)$ and $\mu_\text{goal}(s \mid c)$ seem to be abused.

### Questions
1. The authors should include introductions of related data sharing baselines in the preliminaries or related work section, e.g., CDS, PDS and UDS partially used as baselines. 
2. What is the applicable domain of CGO problems? As mentioned in the weaknesses, why can't we relabel the unsupervised data for a targeted task as the context can be usually derived from the state, since the context $c$ in this setting remains unchanged? I may foresee an issue that this derivation may not be easy for language instructions. However, texts as contexts are not involved in the experiments. The authors also mention that they can use "an oracle function to tell whether a state is within the goal set" (in Section 4.1).
3. Why do the experiments replace 0/1 rewards with -1/0 rewards? Are they intrinsically different or empirically different?
4. Why not use the theoretically sound SDS+PSPI method for experiments?
5. I'm confusing about the reward prediction approach adopted to the baselines. How can we train a reward model with only using postive data (from $D_\text{goal}$)? For the usage of the reward model, can you ellaborate the meaning of "choosing the percentile as 5% in the reward distribution evaluated by the context-goal set as the threshold to label goals" in Appendix C.1?
6. In Section 4.3, what is the reason for the observation that "for PDS, we can observe that the reward distribution for positive and negative samples are better separated in the large one than the medium one?"
7. What are main differences among the three experimental settings (from Section 4.3 to 4.5)? I observe a different range of context distribution but it seems that all test contexts are either fully in-distribution or partially in-distribution (Table 4) but not include real out-of-distribution cases.

### Summary
This paper considers the goal-conditioned offline RL problem where an agent needs to learn to reach given goals given offline training data. They assume that the dataset contains environment trajectories (excluding rewards and termination flags), $D_{dyn}$, and goal labels for some states, $D_{goal}$. They then propose combining the given dataset to produce a trajectories dataset that includes rewards and termination flags, such that any offline algorithm can be used to learn policies. Precisely, their approach (SDS) adds an absorbing action and an absorbing state to the original trajectories, then gives rewards of 1 for the absorbing action in states with goal labels ($D_{goal}$) and rewards of 0 for the absorbing action in all states in $D_{dyn}$. They then provide a theorem bounding the optimality of policies learned from the modified dataset, and provide experiments comparing their approach with other offline RL methods.

### Strengths
- The paper is mostly well-written and investigates an important problem. The specific proposed approach for learning goal-conditioned policies given a trajectory dataset and only positive examples of goal-state labels is novel and interesting.
- The proposed algorithm is theoretically grounded by showing that the set of optimal value functions is not unchanged by the approach.
- The paper shows numerous empirical results comparing SDS + OfflineRL with a couple OfflineRL baselines in continuous control tasks. Impressively, SDS + OfflineRL is either comparable or outperforms prior OfflineRL works.

### Weaknesses
**MAJOR**

1- **Theory**:

  - The theoretical assumptions seem imprecise or incorrect. For example, the authors say that the state, action, and context spaces can be continuous. If they are continuous (say $|\mathcal{A}|=|\mathcal{S}|=|\mathbb{R}|$), then $|\Pi|$ is extremely large (e.g contains $|\mathcal{A}|^{|\mathcal{S}|}=\aleph_1^{\aleph_1}$ deterministic policies). In this case $\epsilon_{dyn}$ will be extremely large, making the RHS of the bound in Theorem 3.1 extremely large.

  - If I understand Theorem 3.1 correctly, then the right-hand side of the bound is almost always greater than $V_{max}=\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ (since the rewards are only non-zero at goal states and are 1 otherwise). Since this would make the bound useless, I am probably misunderstanding the meaning of each term on the RHS. It would have been helpful if the authors explained step-by-step each term of the bound and how that leads to a small regret with high probability (maybe using an example domain)

  - The motivation for why Algorithm 1 is expected to work is not given, which makes it hard to get an intuition for its general applicability. In fact, the algorithm looks like it shouldn't work, since it gives zero rewards for all states in $D_{dyn}$, potentially including goal states that were given rewards of 1 in $D_{goal}$. It is not clear why this reward scheme makes sense.

  - The presentation of the theoretical results is very poor (mainly Section 3.3). 

    - There is barely any explanation of what the Theorem, Assumptions, and Definitions are saying. For example, Definition 3.4 defines "generalized concentrability" out of the blue and does not explain what it is saying and how it is relevant. It is also not clear why it uses the same symbols that were defined for just "concentrability" in Theorem 3.1.

    - Some symbols or functions like $a^+$, $g$, $\mathcal{F}$, and $\mathcal{G}$ are defined but not explained. What are they supposed to represent? For example, I am assuming $a^+$ represents a terminating action similar in behavior to terminating sets in Options. For another example, Theorem 3.1 suggests $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are sets of value functions, but Assumption 3.2 suggests $\mathcal{G}$ is a set of reward functions. It is also not clear what $R$ in this assumption is (I am just assuming it is a reward function). It is also unclear what MDP $Q^\pi$ and $R$ are defined for in this assumption. 

    - There is a general sense of scattered explanations that makes the paper hard to read. For example, Section 3.3 jumps straight into Theorem 3.1 which is about SDS + PSPI without even explaining PSPI. Only after is PSPI explained in Section 3.3.1.  


2- **Experiments**:

  - All the experiments are in a single domain (the D4RL AntMaze). While the 3 variations in goal distributions are useful, comparisons with baselines in other domains (e.g another D4RL domain) would have helped get a better sense of the general applicability of the proposed approach 

  - The paper reports means and standard deviations over only 5 seeds. These are not enough to support the strong empirical claims of the paper.

3- **Related Works**:

  - There is no related works section in the main paper. I think moving the related works to the appendix is going a bit too far. The related works section is important to contextualise the contributions of this work in relevant literature properly. At least a brief related works section could have been included in the main paper (leaving the expanded version for the appendix).

3- **Limitations**:
  
  - The proposed approach is only applicable to goal-conditioned tasks with rewards of 1 only at goal states and zero rewards otherwise.

  - The paper makes very strong assumptions about the offline dataset. Mainly, they assume that the goals dataset ($D_{goal}$) contains all the goals the agent will encounter and that the trajectories dataset ($D_{dyn}) contains trajectories leading to those goals.


**MINOR**

- What is the meaning of "the goal sets can overlap but their intersection is empty'
- Figure 1.c is unclear. What are the overlapping goals?
- "Medium-play and large-play datasets" are never explained. A brief explanation would have helped with readability.
- Page 7 "different ..."

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could address the major weaknesses I outlined above. I am happy to increase my score if they are properly addressed, as I may have misunderstood pieces of paper.

Additionally, 

- I suggest the authors follow the Theorem, Assumptions, and Definitions with clear explanations of what they are saying.
- It may help readability to start section 3.3 with 3.3.1 instead of the Theorem.

**### POST REBUTTAL ###**

Thank you to the authors for the time and effort they spent providing clarifications to my concerns. I have carefully read their response to my review and all the other reviewers. Their response has indeed addressed some of my concerns, precisely: Theory 1,2,4 and Limitations 2. The revised paper is also much clearer than before. Unfortunately, some of my major concerns about the theory, experiments, and related works remain. 
- The authors completely ignored my concern about the related works section.
- My concern about the experiments remains. I think the authors should also demonstrate their approach in other domains. 
- Theory 3 does not address my concern that the reward scheme used in Algorithm 1 is potentially problematic. If $(s_0,a_0,s_1),...,(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}),...,(s_{T-1},a_{T-1},s_T)$ is a trajectory in $D_{dyn}$ and $(s_t,c)$ is in $D_{goal}$, then $\bar D_{dyn}$ will contain $((s_t,c), a^+, 0, (s_{t+1},c))$ but $\bar D_{goal}$ will contain $((s_t,c), a^+, 1, (s^+,c))$. 
  - This contradiction in the rewards and transitions of $\bar D_{dyn}$ and $\bar D_{goal}$ make the resulting offline-RL dataset ill-defined. 
  - $\bar D_{dyn}$ also doesn't satisfy the given augment MDP definition. I.e. $a^+$ must lead to $s^+$ with reward of 1, not  $s_{t+1}$ with reward of 0. 
  - Finally, I assume a transition with the original action $a_t$ is also added to $\bar D_{dyn}$ (otherwise the generated offline dataset $\bar D_{dyn} \cup \bar D_{goal}$ will only contain the $a^+$ action for all transition samples). However, the handling of that action, e.g. $((s_t,c), a_t, ???, (s_{t+1},c))$, is not mentioned in Algorithm 1 nor anywhere else in the paper. 
- Appendix B1 doesn't help either as it is riddled with imprecise and unjustified statements. For example,
  - $\bar V^{\bar \pi}(s) := \bar Q^{\bar \pi}(x,\bar \pi)$ is imprecise and inconsistent in notations. Maybe the authors instead meant  $\bar V^{\bar \pi}(x) := \bar Q^{\bar \pi}(x,\bar \pi(x))$, but I can't be certain since they then use this in their subsequent statements/proofs.
  - They authors state that Lemma B.2. is obvious and hence offer no proof. This is unjustified. Remark B.1. is also unjustified and potentially ill-defined (it is unclear what $x$ is an element of here, e.g ${X}, \bar {X}, {X}^+$, and also $\pi$ is not defined for all $a \in \bar A$).

In general, I think the approach proposed in this paper is promising and probably sound since the empirical results are also promising, but the authors just need to improve their experiments and revise their theoretical presentation thoroughly to make sure it is clear and indeed sound. Hence, I decreased my score from a 5 to a 3, and have increased my confidence from a 3 to a 4.
