- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
The field of Vision-and-Language (VL) has witnessed a proliferation of pretrained foundation models. Current techniques typically employ only one type of training objective, whether it's (1) contrastive objectives (like CLIP), (2) image-to-text generative objectives (like PaLI), or (3) text-to-image generative objectives (like Parti). However, all these three objectives are mutually relevant and are all based on image-text pairs. Intuitively, the first two objectives can be considered as complementary projections between two modalities, and contrastive learning can preserve global alignment and generations facilitate fine-grained understanding. Inspired by this, we present a Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT) to first time unify the three pre-training objectives in one framework. Specifically, CoBIT employs a novel unicoder-decoder structure consisting of an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The image/text unicoders can switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, enabling flexibility and shared knowledge that benefits both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. CoBIT achieves superior performance in image understanding, image-text understanding (Retrieval, Captioning, VQA, SNLI-VE), and text-based content creation, particularly in zero-shot scenarios.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel model named Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT) aimed at unifying three pre-training objectives, namely, cross-modal contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, under a singular framework. This unification is achieved through a unique unicoder-decoder architecture that houses an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The unicoders are capable of toggling between encoding and decoding roles based on the task at hand, thereby promoting shared knowledge which is advantageous for both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. The authors claim that this model architecture allows for superior performance in various tasks like image understanding, image-text understanding, and text-based content creation, with a significant highlight on its effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. The model's efficiency is validated through a series of comprehensive experiments, demonstrating an impressive performance against existing models in the field of Vision-and-Language (VL).

### Strengths
- Unified Framework: CoBIT effectively brings together three prevalent pre-training objectives under a single framework, which could potentially lead to a more holistic understanding and representation of image-text pairs.

- Flexible Architecture: The unicoder-decoder structure is innovative and allows for flexibility and shared knowledge, which is beneficial for multiple generation tasks.

- Zero-shot Performance: The model demonstrates high accuracy and superior performance in zero-shot scenarios across various tasks like image understanding, image-text retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation.

- Parameter Efficiency: The paper highlights excellent parameter efficiency, as the same set of Transformer parameters are utilized for both encoding and decoding tasks, which is a crucial factor considering the computational resources.

### Weaknesses
- Assumed Synergy: The core premise of CoBIT hinges on the idea of a symbiotic relationship between image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks. However, the paper doesn't thoroughly investigate or justify the assumed synergy. It's crucial to establish a theoretical foundation for this assumption, or the unified framework might not hold in different contexts or datasets.

- Objective Conflicts: While unifying different objectives under a single framework is innovative, it poses a risk of conflicting objectives that might detract from optimizing each task individually. The paper acknowledges this to some extent but doesn't provide a robust solution to mitigate potential conflicts.

- Evaluation Scope: The evaluation primarily focuses on showcasing the model's strengths, with a less thorough investigation into the model’s weaknesses or failure modes. A more balanced evaluation, including a deeper exploration of where the model falls short, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations.

### Questions
- Theoretical Justification: A deeper theoretical analysis of the assumed synergy between image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks could strengthen the premise of the unified framework.

- Conflict Mitigation Strategies: Developing and incorporating strategies to mitigate the potential conflicts between different objectives could help in achieving a more balanced optimization across all tasks.

- Failure Analysis: Conducting a thorough failure analysis to identify the model's weaknesses and understanding its behavior under different conditions or limitations could provide a clearer path for future improvements.

### Summary
This paper proposes to unify three commonly used objectives in VL pre-training, namely cross-modal contrastive learning, image-to-text generation, and text-to-image generation, into one pretraining framework. In particular, the authors share the same parameters for Transformer in encoding and decoding. After pretraining on ALIGN, JFT-4B and WebLI datasets, the model shows superiority on image understanding, image-text understanding (retrieval, VQA, captioning) and content creation (text-to-image) tasks among models smaller than 1B parameters.

### Strengths
1.	This paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
2.	Experimental results show good performance in several benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1.	The whole pipeline is not novel and is more like an assembling of existing method/components. As mentioned by the authors, the unicoder is already used in other works  (Sec. 3.2). Three objectives for cross-modal learning are commonly used. Even though it is first joint learned, I cannot see the advantage of combining them. Although the authors claim that they should benefit from each other, it is intuitive that they have different focuses. For example, contrastive loss will benefit retrieval tasks. It could be better if the authors could have more insights on each objective’s advantages from their results.
2.	The advantages of the model over other models are not clear. There is no performance that shows fair comparison with other models. It could be the dataset used for pre-training, batch-size, pretraining epochs, etc. 
3.	From the ablation studies in Table 4, 5 and 6, the gain of proposed joint training of three objectives and shared Transformer (namely unicoder) is rather small and not steady over all tasks. This could not convince me of the advantage of proposed method.
Overall, I think the insight and technical contribution of this paper are limited.

### Questions
•	Can you list the exact parameter sizes of each model in Table1,2,3? That should be more fair comparison.
•	Why are the tasks shown in ablation studies (Table 4,5,6) not consistent? What is the reason for lacking some tasks in each table?
•	Please check the weakness for more questions.

### Summary
This paper first propose a multi-modal transformer trained using image-to-text, text-to-image, and contrastive loss, which are three main types of loss function in multimodal area of research. Specially designed architecture allows training the model with three different loss functions all together.

Trained in bidirectional manner, the proposed CoBiT shows great performance on both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, along with comparable performance on image-text retrieval and other downstream tasks.

### Strengths
This paper further advance the research on bidirectional image-text generation task. Shown from previous works, bidirectional image-text training stablize the training while showing comparable performance to other unidirectional models. This paper further add contrastive loss to this bidirectional concept to let the model efficiently learn the latent of multimodal domain.

Trained on large scale dataset (>4B), CoBiT shows great performance on image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks.

### Weaknesses
The problem is that concept of combining two or more different multimodal losses has existed before. The proposed CoBiT architecture seems to be a mixture of L-Verse ( Kim et al. 2022) and CoCa (Yu et al. 2022). While using three different training losses and successfully train a model is a hard work, The experiment section still lacks justification on how it can improve the model's performance.

Since model is trained with more than 4B image-text pairs which is not easily accessible to other researchers (JFT-4B), training CoBiT from scratch with smaller or more general datasets will help readers compare the performance of CoBiT with other works.

### Questions
Is there any experimental results of CoBiT model trained with more general and smaller datasets? (CC3M, CC12M, yfcc15m, LAION400M, LAION2B)

### Summary
This paper introduces a new model known as the Contrastive Bi-directional Image-Text generation model (CoBIT), which is the first to combine three pre-training objectives in one framework: contrastive objectives, image-to-text generative objectives, and text-to-image generative objectives. CoBIT is composed of an image unicoder, a text unicoder, and a cross-modal decoder. The unicoders can perform both encoding and decoding tasks, allowing them to share knowledge and improve both image-to-text and text-to-image generations. The CoBIT model demonstrated superior performance in multiple areas, including image understanding, image-text understanding and text-based content creation, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. The paper concludes that CoBIT's unification of the three objectives has led to strong zero-shot and transferable capacities in unimodal visual understanding, image-text matching, image-text understanding, and text-to-image content creation.

### Strengths
1. It is the first to unify three pre-training objectives in one framework, effectively combining contrastive objectives, image-to-text generative objectives, and text-to-image generative objectives. This innovative approach sets it apart from existing models and makes a significant contribution to the field of Vision-and-Language (VL).

2. The performance of CoBIT is outstanding. The authors provide a thorough and detailed explanation of the CoBIT model, including its novel unicoder-decoder structure. They also present extensive experimental results to demonstrate its superior performance in various tasks, including image understanding, image-text understanding, text2image and image2text generation.

3. By allowing the image and text unicoders to switch between encoding and decoding in different tasks, the CoBIT model demonstrates a novel approach to handling both text-to-image and image-to-text generation within a single framework. This not only improves the flexibility of the model but also has the potential to inspire future research in multimodal generation tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Computational Efficiency: The use of Unicoder variants in cross-modal generation scenarios, as mentioned in the appendix of the paper, appears to increase the computational load and the number of parameters used in downstream fine-tuning tasks. However, this aspect is not well elaborated in the main text of the paper. A more thorough discussion on the computational efficiency and trade-offs of using Unicoder compared to Encoder would provide clearer insights into the practicality of the model.

2. Impact of Pre-training Data: The paper shows good ImageNet linear probe performance for CoBIT in Table 3. It would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of how the pre-training data impacts the model's performance. This could include experiments with different sizes or types of pre-training datasets.

3. Ablation Study: The ablation study in the paper could be strengthened. 

4. From Table 1, it can be observed that the proposed base and large sizes of the model have more parameters compared to other multimodal models. This increase in model complexity might have implications for computational resources and efficiency. The authors should provide more explanation or justification for this design choice, and possibly discuss the trade-off between model complexity and performance.

### Summary
This paper introduces a complex training framework that combines contrastive learning, image-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image approaches. In addition to the intricate model, they also establish a large-scale database. Through the use of these complex models and extensive data, the trained model performs well on various test tasks.

### Strengths
- The primary contribution of this paper lies in the integration of several models and the creation of a database tailored for training such models. Building upon this foundation, they conducted parameter optimization to fine-tune the loss, ultimately yielding favorable results.
- This paper is easy to read, with coherent writing throughout. The experimental section offers a rich set of comparisons, although there is room for improvement in the analysis and conclusions.

### Weaknesses
While this paper primarily focuses on pre-training and achieves promising results through additional data collection, it still faces the following issues:

- The most significant concern regarding model design in this paper is the limited novelty of the model's contribution. Each module of the model presented in Fig. 2 is already established, and the authors simply combined and fused their losses for joint training. While the training results appear favorable on the extensive data they collected, the paper's drawback remains the lack of model novelty.

- Data is also a concern here. While it's reasonable to leverage more data, it introduces an element of unfairness because the data for the compared models is not consistent. This makes it challenging to draw valid conclusions, and I believe this aspect may also impact the overall findings.

- The optimization process by the authors appears rather intricate, involving the design of numerous loss functions and hyperparameters. This complexity in model design makes replication challenging because the network and parameters are closely tied to the specific dataset they chose. I believe this is also a weakness of the study.

- In the Model Initialization section, the authors mention using CoCa but do not provide a specific explanation for this choice. They do not clarify why they didn't opt for pre-trained BERT models, sentence transformers, or CLIP-based sentence encoders. It would be beneficial if the authors could offer more insight into the rationale behind their selection of COCA as the initialization method and why they didn't consider other pre-trained models for this purpose.

- In Fig. 2, the fact that ViT-VGGAN is frozen to some extent can be considered a weakness, as the existing CoBIT framework assumes the availability of a well-pretrained ViT-VQGAN. This assumption is partially valid, but if the domain changes, it implies that the entire model would need to be re-pretrained. Moreover, if there's a new VQGAN model, the entire model would also require retraining. I am curious about how the authors address this issue, as this paper primarily focuses on pre-training and should ideally rely on existing model checkpoints as much as possible.

- The results of the Linear Probing experiment show a significant improvement, yet the authors have not provided a more substantial explanation. If Linear Probing is the reason for the 1% improvement in performance, how would fine-tuning more parameters affect the outcome?

- The authors trained image captioning using only cross-entropy loss and overlooked RL-based rewards, which are an important component. The authors should have at least discussed how to integrate RL-based methods into this model because RL-based methods, such as self-critical sequence training (SCST), also impose specific requirements on model design.

- Furthermore, when reporting captioning results, the authors should present them on the MSCOCO online test set, as it provides a fair evaluation benchmark, rather than reporting them on a local set.

### Questions
Most of the questions that I would like the authors to address have been raised in the "Weaknesses" section.
