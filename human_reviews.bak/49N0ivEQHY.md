- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
In addressing feature redundancy and training instability in CNNs, orthogonality regularization has emerged as a promising approach. 
Specifically, a variant termed kernel orthogonality regularization 
seeks to optimize models by minimizing the residual between kernel functions of convolutional filters and the identity matrix.

Contrary to methods that measure the kernel residual as a holistic entity, 
our approach introduces a tailored measure that disentangles diagonal and correlation components from the kernel matrix, 
thereby mitigating their mutual interference during training.
Models equipped with this strict kernel orthogonality measure outperform existing methods in near-orthogonality. 
Notably, we observe test accuracy improvements for shallow architectures.
However, as model depth increases, the efficacy of our strict kernel orthogonality approach diminishes.

Given the challenges of strict kernel orthogonality in deeper models and the inherent non-compliance of specific convolutional layers with the kernel orthogonality definition, we introduce the concept of a relaxation theory, wherein strict orthogonality is a special case. 
By adopting this relaxed kernel orthogonality regularization, we observe enhanced model performance in deeper architectures, 
suggesting it as a robust alternative to the strict counterpart.

To validate our approach's efficacy in achieving near-orthogonality and enhancing model performance, we conduct rigorous experiments with our kernel orthogonality regularization toolkit on ResNet and WideResNet in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. 
We observe state-of-the-art gains in model performance from the toolkit and obtain more robust models with expressive features. 
These experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our toolkit while highlighting the often overlooked challenges in orthogonality regularization.

### Summary
The paper addresses an interesting problem whether the pursuit of strict orthogonality is always justified. The paper introduces disentangled orthogonality regularization and a relaxation theory to offer a more flexible approach to orthogonality in deep networks. To validate the approach’s efficacy, the authors conducted rigorous experiments with our kernel orthogonality regularization toolkit on ResNet and WideResNet in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an interesting problem whether the pursuit of strict orthogonality is always justified, and proposes a novel method.
2. The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The improvement is just marginal. 
2. The experiments are far from enough. The authors only tested the method on basic networks and tasks. The authors should compare their method with recent orthogonal baselines. Furthermore, there are many areas that use orthogonality, e.g. continual learning, but these kinds of experiments are not shown in the paper.
3. Lack of complexity analysis. One of the main issue in orthogonal optimization is that the running time complexity of some approaches is really high. The authors should compare the time complexity of their method with recent baselines.

### Summary
This work focuses on the the problem of "orthogonality regularisation" in the context of CNN layers. 

*Orthogonality regularisation:  problem statement.*
The main motivation behind "orthogonality regularisation" can be roughly explained as ensuring that different filters within the same layer are not too similar. Mathematically, if features of each output filter is vectorised $K = (k_1, \dots, k_o)$ where  $k = (i\times k_h \times k_w)$, orthogonality implies that the Gram of these filters is close to identity, namely quantified by Frobenius norm $\| K K^\top \|_F $. This distance can be in turn divided to 1) diagonal elements represent the "contribution" of each filter to the next layer map 2) off-diagonal correlations being close to $0$ implying that filters don't carry linearly dependent information.  

*Main contributions: relaxed orthogonality regularization.*
The central thesis of this work is that while considering over-determined and under determined layers (as defined by output dimension $o$ of kernel vs number of parameters in each filter $i \times h \times w$), the orthogonality constraint needs to be handled with additional constraints.  In the over-constrained case $o < i \times h \times w$: In this case, by fact that the maximum number of linearly independent vectors is bounded by $i\times h \times w,$ the authors argue for a *relaxed orthogonality* constraint, where only a subset of the kernel Gram matrix are subject to the constraints. The authors argue that this cannot be done theoretically, thus based on various heuristics and various assumptions about filter and label distributions, and then create a Monte-Carlo-based simulation that estimates the number of the elements of the Gram that must be subject to the constraints. Then, based on this number $k$, then take out the top $k$ elements of the off-diagonal Gram, and only subject the rest of the elements to orthogonality. The logic behind the "less constrained relaxation" is not yet fully clear.    The authors go on to empirically testing their approach, by imposing the orthogonality regularisation on various ResNet architectures, and show that their approach leads to an improved  test accuracy.

### Strengths
The authors focus on a specific problem with approaches that impose orthogonality of filters in convolutional layers, where sometimes perfect orthognbality doesn't exist. They attempt to solve this issue and present empirical results, suggesting that the method improves the accuracy of various ResNet architectures.

### Weaknesses
Major problems:
- Writing and notation: As elaborated in the detailed problems, the current presentation of results is far from ideal. As the work currently stands, the mistakes prevent me/potential future readers, from grasping what the authors intend to convey. What I found to be particularly confusing was the use of non-standard notation, without prior definition.  The mathematical notation & formalism is supposed to be the last resort for the reader to understand a concept that was ambiguous from text. Thus, having numerous mistakes, non-standard notation, and using same variable names for different concepts, can have a devastating effect on the readability and accessiblity of the paper. 
- While the theory for relaxation of the over-determined system is mathematically justifiable, the approach that the paper takes is inexplicably complicated. Just off the top of my head, I can think of a much simpler approach: if $X$ is a $n\times m$ matrix where $n > m$,   obviously $X X^\top = I$ will never be possible. However, achieving the identity for the transpose $X^\top X = I$ is entirely possible. 
 - Theory for less-determined system. Why should we relax a problem that already has a solution? from what I understand from the theory, the problem of relaxation of less-determined layers is either mathematically not sound, or very vaguely explained. 
- Missing ablations: since the improvements reported in the experiments are rather small, and presented method involves multiple hyper parameters, without having an ablation for every single hyper parameters, the results can be entirely called into question. In other words, it is necessary. If the improvement in test accuracy is overly sensitive to any hyper parameter, the value selection for the hyper-parameter can be interpreted as "cherry picking"
- Comparison to other methods: While authors present the main empirical results in Table 1 (caption needed!), and compare vanilla, Frobenius, strict, and relaxed orthogonality regularisation, they should expand this comparison to competitor methods that belong to the same realm, i.e., orthogonality regularisation to achieve higher accuracy. 

Detailed issues: 
- page 2 second to last line: Tammes problem??
- page 3: $K K^\top  \neq I_{o×o} , o > (i × k_h × k_w )$
- page3 eq (3) & eq(4): what is the formal meaning behind &rarr;? weird notation to say that we want these values to be 0 & 1 ...
- also, why "less"-determined? It seems much better to say "under"-determined 
 - p4 eq (6): how come this switches from $K$ to $\tilde K$ from left to right hand side? Since $\tilde K$ is normalized, it would seem logical that all are $\tilde K$ 
-  p4 first you have defined $c$ as the vectorized lower triangular part of $\tilde K \tilde K^\top$, and suggest it's a vector of length $o(o-1)/2$, but then you keep referring to $c_{k_i, k_j}$ as if it has two indices? 
- p4 & p5: following up on the previous point, the notations $c_{(0,0)},c_{(0,1)},c_{(0,1)},c_{(1,1)}$ appear without definition. Are these related to the correlation vector $c$ defined before? If yes, why are they indexed using $0$ and $1$ instead of over $1,\dots, o(o-1)/2$? If these are new variables, why using overlapping names? Furthermore, the notation $ \dots = 1: c_{(1,1)}$ is a very confusing notation. Is this the definition of $c_{(1,1)}$ as a group of pairs? the $:$ used here is not a standard way of defining a variable. 
- p5: "with a relative small magnitude, since the flexible filters will be redistributed to alleviate filter redundancy in training to get the better representation" this sentence is not comprehensible 
- p5: "$k_i$ may locate in the orthogonal complement of the structural filter k_⊥$ this sentence is both grammatically wrong and mathematically confusing and ambiguous 
- p5 eq(9): there is a condition on $i$ such that $k_i$ being structural filter, but nothing on $j$, so this sums over all $j$? this seems 
- p5 eq(10) The introduction of $\tilde{\text{card}}$ is not mathematically sound. The $\forall k_i\in K \dots $ does not directly appear in the definition of $\tilde{\text{card}}$. 
- In eq(11) the notation &rarr; is used again, without prior definition. The only standard way of interpreting is $A &rarr; B$ meaning A implies B, which doesn't make any sense here.  This is not a standard notation. So it needs either to be defined, or the formula must re-stated in standard way 
- eq(12): $c\\ \text{topk}_k(c)$ I'm guessing from context that it implies to zero-outing the top $k$ elements, but again, this is not a standard notation. If you want to explain this non-formally, just use words and sentences, but when you write a mathematical formula, it must be logically consistent and interpretable. 
- eq(12) since $k$ was heavily used before for denoting filters, it's better to avoid using it for the integer $k$ here, which seems to be an unrelated quantity 
- Section 3.3.2: So far in the motivation there is only mention of convolutional layers and filters, Why here there is a sudden jump to a fully connected type layer $X_j = K_j X_{j-1}$. 
- p6 "where K contains filters producing meaningful features, while $K\setminus K∗$ contains filters that optimize training loss but might not generalize well." What is your backup/reasoning for this? This seems like a claim without any support. 
- p6 "Instead of imposing strict orthogonality regularization on $R^{o_j}$ , we focus on the strict orthogonality on the transition dimension rank∗(Kj). " Rank of a matrix is a scalar number, what does mean to impose orthogonality on the rank of a matrix? 
- p6 "This approach is referred to as relaxed disentangled orthogonality regularizationon less-determined layers" The less-determined system, as you defined as having fewer filters than free variables, already has a perfectly orthognal solution. So what does it mean to "relax" this orthogonality? 
- Fig2: The schematic seems to suggest presence of some caption is only using a linear fully connected layer $X_j = K_j (X_{j-1})$, what is the link between the figure and this explanation. Again, so far the paper only mentions convolutional layers, so what does this figure imply in the context of convolutions? 
- p6: there are multiple places that $\min\text{rank}(X)$ appears. Unless the authors have a different intention behind this formulation, rank of $X$ is a scalar, so minimum of rank of $X$ simply returns the rank of $X$. 
- p6: "The computation of cardinality k (Equation (10)) replace $n$ with $rank(K_j )$" there is no $n$ in the eq(10), not clear what this means
- experiments: what is the number of independent runs?

### Questions
- p5: it is mentioned that labels are sampled uniformly for the MC simulations. What about the filters $k_i$'s? Are they sampled from some distribution too? or the actual filters from the model are used? If they are actual filter parameters, then, this means that the relaxed orthognality loss, must be re-computed at every step of the training? (since the vectors are updated, the value for $k$)
- Layerwise caapactity .... p6: $(K1)_{oj1} ×·, (K2)_{oj2} ×·, oj1 ≥ oj2 \implies $ what does this condition mean?

### Summary
This work focused on developing a new orthoganality regularization when training convolutional neural networks. The novelty lied at the disentanglement of the regularization on the diagonal and correlation elements. Besides this so-called "strict" regularization, the authors also proposed a relaxed version of orthogonality regularization for two cases:

1. Since an over-determined matrix can not have the identity Gram matrix, the authors proposed to remove the regularization on part of the correlation elements.
2. When a weight matrix is under-determined, the weight matrix is relaxed to be allowed have a lower rank, which is lower bounded by a few factors like the data complexity, dataset attributes and layerwise capacity.

The authors provided experiment results on the proposed method on CIFAR-10/100 datasets. The proposed method showed marginal improvements over other baselines.

### Strengths
+ One technical contribution I like about this work is the relaxed regularization on the correlation elements for over-determined layers. Most previous regularization methods applied uniform regularization on the correlation elements which can not be all zeros is not satisfactory indeed. Identifying a set of "structural" filters as termed in this work would help to release potential of CNNs from over-strict regularizations while sustaining orthogonality.

+ The relaxation in the under-determined case is also interesting. Allowing lower row rank in weight matrices further improves the flexibility during training.

### Weaknesses
- Firstly, the notations in this work are over-complicated, making it difficult to grasp the main message from the authors.
- With so many different versions of strict and relaxed regularizations, this work failed to clearly distinguish the effects brought by these regularizations through well-designed ablation studies.
- In page 6, the authors used the analogy between the method for mitigating overly expressive issue and dropout, which I think is inappropriate because Dropout has different behaviors during training and inference. It is more accepted to understand dropout as an ensembling method withing one layer.
- The empirical performance is only marginally improved in many cases.
