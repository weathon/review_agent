# Equivariant Graph Network Approximations of High-Degree Polynomials for Force Field Prediction

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 3

## Abstract
Equivariant deep models have recently been employed to predict atomic potentials and force fields in molecular dynamics. A key advantage of these models is their ability to learn from data without requiring explicit physical modeling. Nevertheless, use of models obeying underlying physics can not only lead to better performance, but also yield physically interpretable results. In this work, we propose a new equivariant network, known as PACE, to incorporate many-body interactions by making use of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) mechanism. To provide a solid foundation for our work, we perform theoretical analysis showing that our proposed message passing scheme can approximate any equivariant polynomial functions with constrained degree. By relying physical insights and theoretical foundations, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on atomic potential and force field prediction tasks on commonly used benchmarks.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new equivariant network which use the Atomic Cluster Expansion mechanism to encode many-body interactions. The proposed framework can provably approximate any equivariant polynomial functions with constrained degree. Experiments on several molecule benchmarks show the effectiveness of the model.

### Strengths
The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

The proposed model is well motivated, and surpasses previous models in terms of the ability to provably approximate equivariant high-degree polynomials.

The theoretical studies on approximating high-degree polynomial functions are appreciated.

### Weaknesses
1. I recommend adding some experiments to empirically show (1) whether PACE empirically approximates the equivariant high-degree polynomials; and (2) whether PACE can surpass existing works on approximating these polynomials.

2. Some other highly-related popular benchmarks, such as AcAc, which is adopted in (Batatia et al. 2022a; Batatia et al.2022b) should also be included.

3. I think Section 4.3 should be “Algorithm efficiency” instead of “Ablation study”.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces equivariant polynomial interactions, expanding the atomic cluster expansion framework and leading to improved performance on molecular dynamics datasets (rMD17). The work is well motivated and benchmarked.

### Strengths
The benchmark results are strong, method are well motivated, and the majority of paper is well written (improvements to make mentioned below).

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness -- which can easily be improved in the revision, is helping the reader understand and keep track of particular indices.

For section 2.3, I know that this is rephrasing of the ACE paper, but since later in the paper you treat the A's as equivariant and in the irrep basis to be contracted with CG coefficients, you may want to say something more about the equivariant nature of the c's and A's in this section to prep the reader and include a bit more foreshadowing about what elements are similar / different. I would also more clearly define the v indices as they are used throughout the paper.

Figure 3 is extremely helpful for understanding the equation below equation 10 -- I was unable to understand the equation without it. I know it takes up a huge amount of space, but even the second order version of the diagram would really help the reader parse the equation. I would prioritize Figure 3 over Figure 2.

### Questions
I do not have any questions.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new equivariant network called PACE to incorporate many-body interactions by making use of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) mechanism. The authors provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed message-passing scheme can approximate any equivariant polynomial functions with a constrained degree. PACE can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several atomic potential and force field prediction tasks.

### Strengths
* The proposed message-passing scheme, which effectively approximates equivariant polynomial functions within a constrained degree, is a noteworthy contribution. The accompanying theoretical analysis is well-grounded.
* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
* The empirical analysis could be enhanced to better support the motivation. As I understand, the primary contribution of PACE, as compared to MACE, is the introduction of self-interaction layers that map the atomic base $A_i$ to different subspaces for different body orders, thereby increasing expressive power of PACE. However, the paper lacks an ablation study directly analyzing the significance of this operation. Although MACE could be considered a natural ablative baseline, it's unclear whether the two models share the same hyper-parameters, such as those mentioned in Table 5. I recommend that the authors conduct a direct ablation experiment to clarify this point.

### Questions
* Here is a sentence not easy to follow. In the 3rd paragraph in sec 3.1, ``While TFN has the ability to approximate all equivariant polynomial functions with an infinite number of layers, the approximation capacity of the equivariant message passing scheme is inherently limited.'' The authors should clarify the logic between these sentences.
* Considering that all baseline models except MACE possess the universal approximation ability for all equivariant polynomials, it's puzzling why they do not achieve performance comparable to PACE. Could the authors elaborate on this?

### Summary
This paper proposed an improvement over the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method, by introducing a polynomial many-body interaction layer in the neural network force field. It was theoretically proved that the polynomial many-body interaction layer can approximate any equivariant polynomial function with a fixed degree. Experiments were conducted on rMD17 and 3BPA datasets where the proposed method show a marginal improvement over the baseline methods.

### Strengths
The paper is written in a clear form and easy to read. The theoretical studies in Section 3.3 is solid.

### Weaknesses
-  The improvement in the experiments is so marginal. Recent years, people [1] have already noticed that achieving a small energy and force error is only the first step towards a successful neural network force field. The advantage of a neural network force field should be judged on the prediction of macroscopic properties and sampling of conformations on a long-time large-scale molecular dynamic simulation. An improvement on the energy/force error does not necessarily lead to a better MD prediction, unless the improvement is very obvious. Based on the numbers shown in Table 2 and 3, as well as the limit of the datasets, I'm not convinced that the proposed model is a better model than the baselines. Also the proposed model is slower than MACE, making it more useless in applications.

- The theoretical statement in this paper is not very important. Theorem 2 showed that the proposed polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate any polynomial equivariant functions. However, the goal of designing a neural network force field is to develop an end-to-end approximation to potential energy -- which is a non-polynomial equivariant function of the input coordinates. It is already proved that multi-layer perceptrons can already approximate any (polynomial or not) functions by the universal approximation theorem. So, no matter whether the polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate polynomial equivariant functions or not, the entire neural network is a universal approximator for any equivariant functions. This is why I think the value of Theorem 2 is limited.

### Questions
A key factor of the proposed neural network is the degree in the polynomial many-body interaction module denoted by v. I wonder how does the degree affects the error and the running time/memory cost of the model?
