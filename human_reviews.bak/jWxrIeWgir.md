# HOSC: Hyperbolic Oscillating Periodic Activations for Sharp Feature Preservation in Implicit Neural Representations

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
In learning implicit neural representations of field functions, the choice of activations critically influences a model's capacity to encode intricate signal and pattern properties. Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, and more recent ones like SIREN, serve the role to provide bases for the signal approximation. However, especially when it comes to preserving sharp features in signals like SDFs or RGB images, the choice of the activation plays a crucial role. In this work, we introduce a novel activation function that we denote as the Hyperbolic Oscillating Activation (H), defined as $\text{hosc}(x) = \tanh(a \sin(x))$.

Our empirical evidence demonstrates HOSC's superior capability in preserving high-frequency sharp details in comparison to both SIREN and the non-periodic Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, achieving faster convergence rates, and yielding lower losses in signal encoding tasks at reasonably small computational complexity overhead. When juxtaposed with ReLU and SIREN, HOSC offers notable advantages, underscoring its potential as a favored choice for implicit neural field networks.

The research and evaluations presented in this paper affirm the potential of \HOSC{} as a robust, efficient, and high-performing periodic activation function for neural implicit fields of curves, images, and SDFs, opening avenues for further exploration in this domain.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces the HOSC activation tanh(a sin(bx)), and demonstrates that it outperforms ReLU and SIREN at fitting signals with sharp discontinuities, such as square and sawtooth waves in 1D and natural images in 2D. They probe a number of hyperparameters such as the sharpness of the HOSC (it must be sufficiently sharp to match the sharpness of the desired signal), and the width / number of layers of the MLP.

### Strengths
Overall the paper is clearly presented and easily understood. The parameterization is simple and original, and the investigation into its properties are thorough. They reveal failure cases of ReLU and SIREN networks in capturing sharp edges in images, which their method convincingly addresses.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are inadequate given the rapid progress in implicit neural representations since SIREN. The authors need to demonstrate that HOSC makes a difference on 3D objects and scenes (e.g. the NeRF dataset) and/or gigapixel images, and/or continues to yield benefits when combined with modern INR parameterizations such as DVGO, TensorRF, Instant NGP, etc. In particular, DVGO was explicitly designed to address this same issue of capturing sharp boundaries in 3D, so this method should also be compared against. I believe SIREN or ReLU networks (with positional encodings) can easily fit the cameraman image with the right choice of hyperparameters, so if the authors want to argue that efficient training is HOSC's primary benefit then they need to actually scale this method to a real use case (e.g. radiance fields of a real 3D scene) and show improvements in training time compared to other fast methods like Instant NGP. If not, then the authors need to reconsider the motivation for this method. The authors saying that they "focus on pure representation learning, without altering the input signal with a predefined mapping function" is not a reasonable excuse, if they cannot justify why this "pure" method is more useful for any specific application.

Minor:
- heatmap/residual scales should be standardized in figures 4, 5, 6 and 8

### Summary
The paper presents a new activation function Hyperbolic Oscillating Activation (HOSC) used in implicit neural representations, which can preserve more high-frequency sharp details, achieve faster convergence rates, and yield lower losses. The experiments show the superiority of the activation function for neural implicit fields of curves, images, and SDFs.

### Strengths
1. The architecture of the paper is good and easy to follow.
2. The activation function is simple but effective, and the performance is much better than the normally used functions'.
3. The experiments are persuasive and can basically prove the author's viewpoint.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 3 and Figure 4 are not referenced in this paper. Please revise it.
2. The experiment 1 is about fitting square wave and sawtooth wave. Maybe more results such as the loss values and fitting figures of complex or random signals in the main body could make the paper more persuasive, because the complex or random signals are more important than regular signals in the provement.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new activation function for MLPs used as coordinate-based networks which improves the signal representation quality. This activation makes use of a sinusoidal function and a tanh function with a "temperature" parameter, which allows the representation to better fit high frequency signals with more accuracy. The improved reconstruction quality is demonstrated across a number of fitting examples with coordinate-based networks, such as 1D signal fitting, image fitting, and SDF fitting.

### Strengths
In my opinion, the strengths of the paper are:
1. The proposed activation function seems to lead to noticeable improvements over standard ReLU and sine activation functions (SIREN) in 1D signal and image fitting especially. It is obvious from the qualitative and quantitative results that the proposed contribution can lead to significantly better reconstruction quality with the right hyperparameters.
2. The paper motivates the problem well: coordinate-based networks are used in a large number of tasks across vision and graphics, such as representing 3D geometry, inverse rendering in learning 3D representations from images, and providing compressed representations of other signals such as images.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the weaknesses of the paper are:
1. The evaluations are not extensive in comparing to competing methods, and across different applications

    1a. Comparisons to only SIREN and ReLU networks are not very extensive. I am not sure I agree with the fact that positional encoding should not be included in the comparison, since an embedding layer as the first layer of a network seems reasonable to me and is what is used for most coordinate-based applications now. No comparison to this severely limits the impact as researchers who work with these networks will be unlikely to change to something like HOSC without a detailed comparison. Additionally, there are a number of other alternate coordinate-based network architectures which are not compared to. For example, a brief search reveals [1] and [2], which also claim improvement over ReLU and SIREN architectures. There is no reason why HOSC should not be compared to these.

    1b. The comparisons are only done for "overfitting" signals, i.e. memorizing a 1D/2D/3D function values, and not for utilizing these representations in inverse problems, as is how they are mainly used in research. For example, using "radiance fields" as a motivation for improving the fitting of coordinate-based networks, and then not demonstrating how HOSC performs in radiance field applications seems like an overclaim. This is because the inverse problem solved in radiance fields not only requires accurate fitting of the supervised values, but accurate interpolation between these values for novel view synthesis (see next point). Lack of comparison here severely limits the applicability of HOSC to a narrow range of cases, perhaps on signal overfitting or compression, which is not emphasized as the efficiency of networks using HOSC is not compared (such as, showing that it can fit a signal with less parameters for example).

    1c. The paper makes no attempt to evaluate the "generalization" properties of coordinate-based networks using the HOSC activation function. For example [3] extensively studies this for Fourier Features, and shows that the frequency affects how well these networks generalize, or in other words, how they behave between the supervised points. This is an extremely important property of coordinate-based networks in imaging and vision tasks, and it is not explored at all in this paper.

2. One other minor complaint is on the robustness of the method - there seems to be an extra hyperparameter, a, which significantly affects the signal reconstruction quality. Other methods, such as SIREN, also have hyperparameters. For SIREN specifically, the w0 factor described in the original paper affects the quality of the fit considerably. Why is a tuned, but not w0? I am not sure if it is a fair comparison, and without testing both of these, I'm not sure how robust HOSC is to various levels of a.

One minor comment: In the 4th sentence of the paper, m=5 (position and view direction) and n=4 (color and opacity) for radiance fields, not m=4, n=3.

### Questions
I do not have additional questions on the paper. I view the lack of comparisons a significant weakness of the paper, and expanding upon this axis would significantly increase the strength of the paper. Specifically, including additional comparisons to other work which has been published and shown to improve upon ReLU and SIREN architectures in signal fitting is crucial. Additionally, without a study on the generalization within the signal domain properties and/or a comparison on solving an inverse problem task where coordinate-based networks are actually used, such as radiance field fitting, the HOSC method seems extremely limited to simple problems in fitting 1D/2D/3D signals. Adding these comparisons would be extremely important for writing a high impact paper, where I believe that the potential of HOSC is high as the method does show significant improvement against the baselines on the tasks it is compared on.

**Update after the author response**

I appreciate the additional comparisons, I believe they increase the strength of the paper. However, I am not inclined to change my score. I still see there as being too many limitations: cannot be applied to radiance fields, and lack of generalization evaluation. Note, I do not mean generalization in the sense of deepSDF (between the weights of different representations) but rather generalization in the sense of the Fourier Features paper, where only a subset of values are supervised on and then are interpolated between. I believe this is extremely critical for evaluating the quality of any coordinate-based network.
