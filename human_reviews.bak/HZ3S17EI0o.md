# Set Learning for Accurate and Calibrated Models

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 6, 3, 8

## Abstract
Model overconfidence and poor calibration are common in machine learning and difficult to account for when applying standard empirical risk minimization. In this work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call odd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets rather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture correlations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and calibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes. Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training with hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such as temperature scaling. We demonstrate this in extensive experimental analyses and provide a mathematical theory to interpret our findings. We emphasize that OKO is a general framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and a trained model can be applied to single examples at inference time, without significant run-time overhead or architecture changes.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new model training paradigm by minimizing the cross-entropy error for sets, rather than for individual examples. The method allows model to capture correlations across samples, and is believed to achieve better accuracy and calibration. The authors provide theoretical on calibration along with extensive experiment results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

### Strengths
Originality: The set learning applied for training machine learning models is a pretty novel concept and paradigm change. 

Quality: The paper is well written with high quality. The authors provide detailed motivations, illustrative figures and comprehensive appendix. 

Clarity: The paper is written with clarity and easy to follow.

Significance: I believe the paper is of great significance to both academia and industry. Set learning is a new paradigm change to how people usually train ML models. The additional benefits brought upon on calibration is important for various applications in industry.

### Weaknesses
Mainly I have some questions on the experiment.

1. The authors set the maximum number of randomly sampled sets to the total number of training data points, such that the gradients updates remain the same. However, does this effectively make the proposed method sees k multiple more data points compared to the standard setting? It would be interesting to see how the experiment results look like when two algorithms are of the sample complexity. 

2. Is there any intuitions behind why the hard loss always outperform the soft loss?

### Summary
The submission addresses the problem of multi-class learning, where the purpose is to reduce the overconfidence of the model by using a specific decomposition of the problem called odd-k-out learning. OKO learning amounts to separate a positive class (or pair class) in which two instances are randomly selected, from a set of negative classes (or odd class) for each of which one instance is selected. The authors show that this makes it possible to obtain less certain model outputs in low-density regions, and thus to restrain miscalibration. Some properties of OKO are rapidly presented, before experiments are reported and a conclusion is drawn.

### Strengths
The language is overall fine. 

The experimental results seem convincing.

### Weaknesses
OKO is only rapidly presented, through how instances are constructed. The overall procedure remains unclear. 

The properties of OKO are succinctly mentioned, but the theoretical reasons for which OKO outperforms classical classifiers are not crystal clear. 

The case considered in the experiments seems to be a very special case, and it is difficult to see whether the conclusions drawn can be generalized.

### Questions
The "set learning" problem you mention in the introduction is not formally defined, nor is the odd-one-out scheme in Section 2. 

As far as I understand, OKO consists in transforming the classification problem into a binary classification problem, as made in the "error-correcting output coding" decomposition strategy. Could you explain the difference between OKO and ECOC ? 

In Section 3, you explain how to construct a training example for the OKO setting. I assume this operation is repeated. Could you elucidate how instance generation can be repeated in the global OKO setting ? 

Could you provide information on the results obtained using the soft loss, and/or insights regarding why the hard loss would give better results than the soft loss ? 

Section 4 is very short. Theorem 1 seems to be limited to the example discussed. The section seems to call for a discussion on the different natures of uncertainty (i.e., aleatory vs epistemic uncertainty) and on the different treatments to be applied accordingly. 

You emphasize the similarity between the relative cross-entropy for calibration you use and the KL divergence. Can you elucidate the advantages of RCE for calibration over KL divergence ? 

You set $k=1$ for all experiments: this seems to correspond to a very special case of OKO. Could you explain the impact of this choice ? This somehow mitigates the conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental part, as it seems difficult to generalize them. Can you elaborate ? 

Typos and writing : 
- I do not understand the notation in Equation (3) ("$f_\epsilon \in ..."); 
- "the occur infrequently" (page 5 bottom); 
- "can be boosted by predicting the odd class using an additional classification head" (page 6) : I do not understand this sentence.

### Summary
This paper proposed a modified loss function that can achieve more accurate and more calibrated classification models. The idea is to define a loss based on a set of instances (and their ground truth). Within each set, two instances are from the same class, and the other k instances are from k distinct classes. The proposed soft loss modifies the cross-entropy loss by replacing the instance-level regression function f by the sum of f functions over the set, and the instance level one-hot ground-truth group indicator by the sample proportion in the set. For the hard loss variant, the instance level one-hot ground-truth group indicator is replaced by the indicator of the most common class in the set.

The authors contend that such modifications foster improved accuracy and calibration, a claim substantiated through comprehensive empirical studies. Nonetheless, the paper does not thoroughly explain the underlying benefits of this proposed method, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding.

Additionally, the paper presents a novel calibration metric dubbed 'relative cross-entropy' (RC). This introduction, however, appears to be executed hastily, with a significant number of details absent, which might leave the concept open to further exploration and clarification.

### Strengths
The proposed loss function seems to be interesting and numerical results show good performance.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical underpinnings presented in the paper are not robustly developed.

The organization of the manuscript lacks coherence, with various concepts introduced but not adequately interconnected or explicated.

For further elaboration on these points, please refer to the questions outlined below.

### Questions
1. page 1 stated that "By construction, this paradigm ignores information that may be found in correlations between sets of data." I do not think "correlation" is the correct word here. I do not see how correlation is explicitly exploited in the newly defined loss function.  Moreover, shouldn't it be the relationship among points in the same set instead of the relationship among different sets?

2. Page 3, algorithm 1: Is it guaranteed that each class is sampled at least once as the pair class? If not, then some class may not be represented in the model.

3. Page 3, equation (1). The inner product is a summation over classes, and the loss function will be summed over sets. Hence, the proposed soft loss essentially boils down to an exchange of the order of summations: the traditional cross-entropy loss sum over instances (in a set) first, and then over the classes; in the proposed loss, one sums over the classes first, and then over the instances within a set. It is then intriguing as to why the improved performance? In a sense, (2) is even closer to the cross-entropy loss than (1), since in (2) only the instance level f function is replaced by the aggregate of (k+2) f functions. In the numerical studies, the soft loss is not presented at all because "we found the hard loss to always outperform the soft loss". I cannot help wondering if the soft loss is even better or on par with the baselines?

4. Since k does not really matter, can it be zero? In fact, can we have more than 2 instances from the dominating class in a set. In this case, (2) would be very similar to a multi-instance learning method.

5. Page 5 stated that "The key observation from Theorem 1 is that, although x = 1 or x = 2 have zero entropy and are thus low-entropy regions, OKO is still uncertain about these points because the occur infrequently". However, this is not necessarily a good thing (or not good enough). For example, the result of Theorem 1 does not say that the calibration is correct. In fact, I am not even sure how to define the calibration in this example because the limit portability distribution seems weird to me: it is distributed as 1/0 when epsilon is greater than 0 and 0/0 when epsilon = 0. Specifically, the limit of epsilon = 0 is a singular case. Can this be generalized to more general settings? In summary, Theorem 1 is about a fairly special case, and even in that case it does not explicitly show that the calibration is correct.

6. I am very puzzled by the subsection titled "Relative Cross-Entropy for Calibration" in Section 4. This RC has nothing to do with OKO and should not be part of a section titled "Properties of OKO". Moreover, this subsection reads very out of context. It is unfortunate that relevant discussion is in the appendix, making it very difficult for the reader to see its relevancy to the topic being discussed in the main text. 

7. Page 6 stated that "RC is no longer proper due to this zero mean." What does "proper" mean? 

8. Page 6 stated that "we report results for a version of OKO with k = 1 where in addition to the pair class prediction (see Eq. 2) a model is
trained to classify the odd class with a second classification head that is discarded at inference time." How is the overall objective including the second classification head defined? A mathematic formula and/or a graph of the network structure would be helpful.

9. Page 6 stated that "For simplicity and fairness of comparing against single example methods, we set the maximum number of randomly sampled sets to the total number of training data points ntrain in every setting." In my opinion, it is still not a fair comparison since for the OKO method there are 3n instances out of the n sets.

10. It is unclear to me what I should look for in Figure 4? Why is one method better than another and how is such an advantage shown in the figure? More specific pointers should be helpful.

11. Page 9 stated that "OKO is a theoretically grounded learning algorithm that modifies the training objective into a classification problem for sets of data. We show various consistency proofs and theoretical analyses proving that OKO yields smoother logits than standard cross-entropy, corroborated by empirical results." I strongly disagree with this statement. In the main text there is only one theorem, which, as I mentioned above in question 5, is not strong enough. There is no consistency results in the main text. 

12. In C.1 it stated "Before proving Proposition 2 from the main text ...."  Proposition 2 is in the appendix, not in the main text.

13. It is clear to me that this paper was writing as a long, comprehensive paper. However, it was trimmed down to 9 pages in order to submit to ICLR, in a rush. For this reason, the presentation of the topics is very poor. There are too many topics in this 9 page paper, and the author did not make a convincing case advocating for the proposed method. Moreover, because of the careless reduction of topics, there are topics that read out of context (e.g. the introduction of RC), and there are topics that should have been explained more (e.g. theoretical justification of the proposed loss.) I think it may serve the readers better by submitting a comprehensive version of the paper to a journal such as JMLR, instead of rushing through a conference.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new training method, which the authors call ``odd-k-out'' for training machine learning classifiers, in order to reduce the problem of over-confidence observed in large models trained on relatively small datasets (which often end up interpolating the training set).

The method essentially boils down to sampling uniformly at random two distinct classes $k_1, k_2$, and then two uniformly random examples $x_1, x_2$ from the first class ($y_1, y_2 = k_1$), and one example $x_3$ from the second class (with $y_3 = k_2$), and taking a gradient step in the direction minimizing the loss given by $e_{k_1}^T \log(\mathrm{softmax}(\sum_{i \in \{1,2,3\}} f_{\theta}(x_i)))$.

The authors report improvement in terms of accuracy and importantly calibration error with respect to a number of benchmarks, and show that their method provides an approach to handle pressing issue stemming from the fact that out-of-the-box machine learning models tend to preform poorly on sub-populations that are underrepresented in the training set. They also provide a theoretical insight into how this assertion can be justified in a simplified model (Theorem 1) --- essentially saying that in specific situations, if on vanishingly small subsets of the universe the features $x_i$ determine the outcome exactly, the OKO-minimizers will only put confidence $2/3$ of this specific outcome (on aforementioned small subsets).

The introduced method seems to be fairly close to ``batch balancing + label smoothing'' --- the authors discuss briefly this method in paper and use it as a comparison point. Batch balancing here refers to sampling examples by first sampling a uniform class, and then sampling a uniform example from the class (as opposed to just sampling uniform example from the entire dataset), which is a standard method to remedy class imbalance in the training set. Label smoothing corresponds to minimizing loss $\ell(f_\theta, \tilde{y}_i)$ where the desired label $\tilde{y}_i$ has some fraction $\alpha$ of mass on the actual class $y_i$ and $1-\alpha$ fraction of mass evenly distributed across remaining classes --- therefore addressing the problem of over-confidence. 

In the OKO method, the load balancing is done explicitly, whereas the label smoothing is somewhat implicit --- while looking at a gradient of an expression $e_{k_1}^T \log(\mathrm{softmax}(\sum_{i \in \{1,2,3\}} f_{\theta}(x_i)))$ which is being minimized, we see that what happens is essentially adding some linear combinations of gradient pushing the outcome of the classifier $f_{\theta}$ to be more confident of outcome $y_1$ on all three examples $x_i$ --- of which two has actual label $y_1$, and the third has uniformly different label --- this feels fairly close to just taking a random class $k_i$, a random example $x_i$ and shifting the weights towards higher confidence of class $k_i$ with probability $2/3$, vs higher confidence for a different (uniformly distributed) class with probability $1/3$ --- essentially label smoothing.

In contrast with label smoothing, as authors show with their Proposition 3, that in a toy example in which labels are directly determined by the feature (i.e. $x_i \in [C]$ is uniformly random, and the corresponding label is $y_i = x_i$, then minimizing OKO-objective (over the class of all functions from $[C]$ to the probability simplex $\Delta([C])$ leads (as it is desirable) to diverging logits: i.e. the predictions $\tilde{f}(x)$ converge to $(0, \ldots, 1, \ldots 0)$ with the label $1$ on the correct label $x$.

### Strengths
The paper discusses quite extensively the existing literature in the topic, deals with extremely pressing issue in the machine learning community, providing a new method to address the problem. As such it has potential of having significant impact, and the paper provides experimental evidence that their proposed method outperforms the known results in terms of calibration and accuracy on standard benchmarks for.

### Weaknesses
Given how close the newly proposed method is to label smoothing with batch balancing in essence, it might be worthwhile to discuss in much more details how the proposed method is in fact different than label smoothing, especially in main body of the paper. Highlighting a bit more the Proposition 3 which they prove in appendix could improve interpretability of their paper.

On page two, in the paragraph "Empirical", the authors write "OKO is a principled approach that changes the learning objective by presenting a model with _sets of examples_ instead of individual examples, as calibration is inherently a metric of sets". This statement seems to run into a fallacy. Indeed, calibration is a metric of sets (or, one can say, distributions over pairs of predictions and outcomes, usually given as a uniform distribution on a finite set),  and indeed the learning objective here is given by presenting a model with _sets of examples_. But those two sets have nothing to do with each other. The easiest way to see it, is that the authors suggest using as a learning objective sets of size $3$ (two in-class examples, and one out-of-class (see ``Experimental details`` page 3) --- and on a set of size $3$ any statement about calibration (even for binary classification) is meaningless --- one needs at least a couple dozens of examples to this.

The main theoretical result is Theorem 1: it considers the following toy scenario, with two classes, where the feature space is $\{0, 1, 2\}$, and the population distribution $F_\varepsilon$ is given as follows. With probability $1-\varepsilon$ we have $x_i = 0$ and $y_i$ is uniformly random class $\{0, 1\}$. With probability $\varepsilon/2$ we have $x_i=1, y_i=0$ and with probability $\varepsilon/2$ we have $x_i=2, y_i=1$. They show that as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the OKO-minimizers tend to something that on $x=1$ outputs the predictions $(2/3, 1/3)$. This is presented as evidence that the OKO, as desired, is not over-confident in regions that are severely underrepresented in the distribution.

I can see two issues with this argument: first of all it is not immediately clear that this behavior is desirable at all, it would be great to provide more of a discussion when it is the case. Even if relatively small fraction of a population distribution has a specific feature that turns out to determine exactly the outcome, as long as this is in fact a feature of population distribution (and not an artifact of small _number_ of examples in the training distribution), it is absolutely reasonable to report this outcome with high confidence on new example that exhibit this feature. It doesn't seem to be too far-fetched either: one can easily imagine having 1% of both population distribution and a training set exhibiting a feature that determines the outcome $y_i$ --- if trained on training sets with several hundred millions of examples, this leads to millions of examples with the aforementioned feature. In a situation like this it is not only reasonable, but in fact desirable to report the determined outcome with high confidence (and it is not difficult to come up with scenarios where this could be crucial).

Second issue is what the authors do not discuss, which is the fact that this behavior proved in their theorem is not an effect of the classes $x_i=1$ and $x_i=2$ represented by small fraction of the population distribution at all --- contrary to the discussion in front of the theorem. In fact, back-of-the-envelope calculation suggest that even if probabilities for $x_i=0, x_i=1, x_i=2$ where all equal $(1/3)$, and $x_i=1$ determined $y_i=0$, $x_i=2$ determined $y_i=1$, (just as in their setup), just as the label-smoothing, would learn to classify examples with $x_i=1$ as having probability of $y_i=0$ to be some number distinctively separated from $1$ (regardless of the amount of training data). This might be even more undesirable in specific situations, and crucially this sheds a different light on how to interpret their Theorem 1: the effect they discuss (of producing a confidence for the label strictly bounded away from $1$) is not introduced by the fact that only vanishingly small fraction of the population has features that seems to determine the label $y_i$ (as suggested by the name of the paragraph ``OKO is less certain in low-data regions''), it is in fact just a consequence of an implicit label-smoothing.

Minor issues regarding the presentation:
There is a lot of plots, stacked together in extremely small space, often on each of the multiple sub-figures in a figure, there is 8 different plots with trend lines, making most of them completely unreadable, and as such not adding much value. That is particularly true about Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5.

The statement of Theorem 1 is somewhat awkward: it consist of two separate sentences --- the first part states using symbols, that for any $\varepsilon$ there exist a minimize for the OKO objective on a distribution $F_\varepsilon$ --- since a statements of this form are often trivial (and the nature of local/global minimizes is the object of study), it takes a bit of time for a reader to understand its importance in this specific situation. It might be worth to expand it slightly --- as it is, the ``Furthermore, ...'' part of the theorem seems on the first glance as the only one conveying meaning.

I am rather confused by the notion of "relative cross-entropy". This seems to be just KL-divergence. The authors say that it is ``very similar yo KL divergence but with different entropy term''. The $RC(P, Q)$ is defined as $H(P, Q) - H(Q)$ (Definition 1), the KL-divergence is $D_{KL}(P || Q) = H(P, Q) - H(P)$, hence $RC(P, Q) = D_{KL}(Q || P)$. The authors say that it is (unlike KL-divergence) not always non-negative, which doesn't seem possible.

The statement of Lemma 1 does not seem to match the explanation  preceding it, and it is not clear what it was meant. Anyway, the conclusion seems true, since the KL-divergence is indeed non-negative without any additional assumptions.

### Questions
Most of my questions was implicitly stated in the discussion about weaknesses. I find the Theorem 1 fairly unconvincing as a desired property of the proposed training method --- it seems like informative Theorem highlighting \emph{a property} of OKO, not necessarily an argument for using it. In light of superficial similarities with batch balancing + label smoothing, expanding a bit on similarities differences between those (and particularly scenarios where OKO seems to behaving closer to what we would expect than label smoothing) would be nice. The Proposition 3 is a great step in this direction, so potentially just highlighting it and providing more detailed discussion about it in the main body of the paper would be nice. 

The Proposition 2 is said to be interpreted as "OKO directly encouraging the risk not to overfit" -- it is unclear to me whether this interpretation is justified. It is not clear what it means that when restricting all but one entry in the purported matrix of logits $F_{i,j}$ the OKO objective have a global minimizer. I imagine that this is supposed to be contrasted with just "standard" minimizing of a cross-entropy loss, in which case the logits in the toy example like this would diverge even when fixed all the remaining entries. Yet it is unclear how this property by itself is related with overfiting/overconfidence of a standard training method.
