# Conservative Reinforcement Learning by Q-function Disagreement

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 3

## Abstract
In this paper we propose a novel continuous-space RL algorithm that subtracts the Q-target network standard deviation from a Q-target network which leads to forcing a tighter upper-bound on Q-values estimation. We show in experiments that this novel Q-target formula has a performance advantage when applied to algorithms in this space such as TD3, TD7, MaxMin, REDQ, etc., where the domains examined are control tasks from MuJoCo simulation.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new Q-learning algorithm by slightly modifying the Double Q-learning's objective function. More precisely, the authors propose to subtract the Double-Q objective by a "std" term, computed as the standard deviation of the two Q-value networks. Experiments are provided to compare the new modification with existing Q-learning algorithms, using tasks from the Mujoco simulation.

## After rebuttal


I cannot access the responses to my three questions.

The other responses did not solve my primary concern that the paper's contribution is too incremental and lacks in-depth analysis. I, therefore, maintain my score.

### Strengths
The paper is clear, solid, and easy to read. I actually like this style of writing. 
The idea of adding the "std" term to the Q-learning objective makes sense to me -- since it aims to reduce the gap between two Q values, this term would make the convergence faster. The new term is also easy to implement.

### Weaknesses
The contributions are too incremental. It is just a minor adaptation of the Double Q-learning algorithm. The majority of the paper is devoted to describing well-known methods. The main idea is presented in less than 2 pages with little insight.

In fact, the term "std" is just to reduce the absolute gap between the two value networks, and I do not see it should be considered as a significant contribution. Moreover, computing standard deviation using only two samples is nonsense to me. The regularizer term is just to reduce the gap between two Q-values, so something like |Q_1 – Q_2| would be enough. The authors should not name this term as "standard deviation."

The experiments are not very convincing. For instance, Table 4 shows that the average improvement rate is negative (so the new approach is worse than its counterpart).

### Questions
1. It is worth showing the gap between the two Q-values during the training, before and after the inclusion of the "std" term.
2. Would simpler terms such as norm(Q_1-Q_2) work?
3. When talking about "std," I would expect to see more samples. Maybe the authors could consider adding more Q-value networks?

### Summary
This paper proposes a variant of value-based policy optimization methods that can be applied to several deep RL algorithms.
In particular, for any algorithm with one or more copies of the Q-function approximator, the authors propose to measure the "disagreement" among the two (ore more) models on a batch of state-action pairs as the average (over the batch) of the empirical standard deviation (across the Q functions), and subtract to the Q-learning target a penalty that is proportional to this measure of disagreement. The intuitive idea is to be conservative (that is, underestimate the Q value) whenever there is a lot of uncertainty, testified by the disagreement. This technique can be used in several deep RL algorithms: double Q-learning, DDPG, TD3, and more. The benefits of this technique are tested on Mujoco and D4RL tasks, comparing with the performance of the original algorithms (TD3, TD7, MaxMin Q-Learning, REDQ).

### Strengths
The paper is generally clear and well written. The experiments are well designed, the empirical results are communicated with an appropriate level of detail.

### Weaknesses
The work is fundamentally incremental. A small variant is applied on top of state-of-the art deep RL algorithms to show some improvement in the learning curves.
First of all, the improvement is not particularly consistent over the different algorithms and tasks that are considered. In many of them, the improvement is not statistically significant, and there is even a slight degradation in some cases.
More importantly, there is no strong motivation underlying the proposed technique, besides the brief intuitive motivation that is provided. Previous approaches to mitigate the overestimation bias of Q-learning are mentioned, but not discussed critically. Nor did the author discuss the similarities between the proposed approach and other methods that try to capture the uncertainty of value estimates, such as distributional RL or ensembles. The latter were only mentioned as another family of algorithms that may benefit from Q-function disagreement.
Similarly, there is no in depth discussion on why the proposed technique works in some cases, and not in others. There is no theory or ablation studies to understand the effect of the proposed algorithmic addition in better detail.
The writing, although generally good, seems rushed in some ways: for example, many parentheses are missing from the citations.

### Questions
How did you select the hyperparameters of the different algorithms, especially alpha?
