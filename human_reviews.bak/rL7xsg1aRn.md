# Masked Structural Growth for 2x Faster Language Model Pre-training

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Accelerating large language model pre-training is a critical issue in present research. In this paper, we focus on speeding up pre-training by progressively growing from a small Transformer structure to a large one. There are two main research problems associated with progressive growth: determining the optimal growth schedule, and designing efficient growth operators. In terms of growth schedule, the impact of each single dimension on a schedule’s efficiency is underexplored by existing work. Regarding the growth operators, existing methods rely on the initialization of new weights to inherit knowledge, and achieve only non-strict function preservation, limiting further improvements on training dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Masked Structural Growth (MSG), including (i) growth schedules involving all possible dimensions and (ii) strictly function-preserving growth operators that is independent of the initialization of new weights. Experiments show that MSG is significantly faster than related work: we achieve up to 2.2x speedup in pre-training different types of language models while maintaining comparable or better downstream performances. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/cofe-ai/MSG.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors propose a framework called Masked Structural Growth (MSG) for progressive pre-training of transformer-based language models. The MSG includes the following two parts:
(1) growth schedules involving all the four possible dimensions;
(2) strictly function-preserving growth operators that are independent of the initialization of new weights.

Their experimental results show that the MSG achieves state-of-the-art speed-up on Bert-base, Bert-large, and GPT-2 with equal or improved performances on downstream tasks.

### Strengths
The greatest strength of the paper is that it introduces the MSG operators for all growth dimensions by using external masks.
These growth operators are strictly function-preserving (even with layer normalization), and independent of the initialization of new weights.
This apparently has the advantages over the growth operators proposed in the previous work.

Additionally, the growth schedule proposed in the MSG uses grid-search to grow only one dimension each time, which provides empirical insights on the growing models and holds the potential for generalization.

### Weaknesses
One weakness of the paper is that the authors have not empirically shown the advantages of the MSG in today's large-scale transformer models (which is much larger than the scale of BERT-large and GPT2). Such a weakness may be due to the lack of the computational resources.
In terms of presentation, the authors may want to add more description on the bert2BERT method, since it is one main competitor to the proposed MSG.

Some minor issues will be listed in the "Questions" section.

### Questions
I list my questions and some minor issues as follows:
(1).
For on page 4 and page 5:
Are vectors x, y, c in your section 3.1.1 all column vectors? If yes, then in Eq. (12),
x^T (the transpose of x) is not necessary, x will be good enough.

(2).
For Eq. (11) on page 5:
For d_2 < i < d_2', it should be:  d_2 < i <= d_2'

(3). Similarly,
For Eq. (14) on page 5:
For d_1 < j < d_1', should be: d_1 < j <= d_1'

(4).
Last line on page 7:
The stated (Qin et al., 2022b) is not the reference for the bert2BERT method.
Do you really mean the bert2BERT or the ELLE here?

### Summary
The manuscript focuses on training transformers faster by progressively growing the architecture during training. Problems with previous methods in this area include limited growth "dimensions" (e.g. inability to progressively grow the hidden dimension), absence of function preservation in networks with LayerNorm, and a forced choice between function preservation and initialization flexibility. The proposed method (MSG) addresses these problems, and experiments support its effectiveness (i.e., it accelerates training). Ablation and hyperparameter studies further justify the chosen methodology and offer insights that are helpful for understanding the progressive growth problem more broadly.

### Strengths
The proposed progressive growth method speeds up training more than competing approaches, and it maintains or improves accuracy/perplexity performances on test datasets (relative to the model without progressive growth).

The study of the impact of different growth dimensions is broadly helpful and clear (Figure 2). This analysis provides intuition for the MSG approach, making it seem less tailored to perform well on just one dataset/architecture (i.e., more generally applicable).

Care is taken to ensure that comparisons across progressive growth methods are fair and that the baseline progressive growth methods are relevant. In Section 4.2, salient features of progressive growth algorithms are isolated appropriately to facilitate analyses of the proposed method, MSG.

The manuscript offers an original and well-designed approach to disentangling the function preservation and initialization decisions of progressive learning. This facilitates the creation of a more flexible growth algorithm and better analysis of the importance of these algorithm components to progressive learning. For example, the final paragraph of Section 4.4 leverages this disentangling to show that both function preservation and flexible initializations matter to performance, supporting the form of the MSG method.

### Weaknesses
While the manuscript makes careful comparisons to competing progressive growth methods, some of the baseline performances (without progressive growth) are a little lower than expected. Please see my comments about this in the "Questions" section below.

### Questions
Score-affecting:

1. Please ensure all baseline approaches are faithful so that readers know MSG is effective in high-performing training runs. Examples follow.
   - In Tables 4 and 5, the SQuAD scores are 2-3% lower than what is reported in the BERT paper.
   - In Table 5, GPT-2 perplexity on Wikitext2 is high (41.3). There are strong public GPT-2 implementations; e.g., https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT. 
      - It would be nice to see an MSG version of the LiGO (Wang et al., 2022) paper's Figure 3C: i.e., show perplexity/loss dynamics of GPT trained with and without MSG.

Helpful:

1. Please summarize the MSG operator conclusions/discussion from the referenced technical report (Li et al., 2023). 
2. Consider moving tables and figures to the page they are discussed on, or to the next page. This helps readability.
3. Clean up figures and tables. Some example suggestions follow:
   - Table 2 could have uniform line lengths. 
   - Figure 2 could have larger axis text, lines, legend text, etc.


Minor:

1. The manuscript would benefit from a proofreading. Some examples follow:
   - "Proof" is not a verb that means "to mathematically demonstrate". Say "we prove" instead of "we proof". A "proof" is what proves something.
   - On page 6, rephrase the second sentence of the "Stage Duration" paragraph -- the training steps are what gets split, not the stage steps.
2. I think that not all the inequalities in the second lines of equations 11 and 14 are strict (i.e., change a "<" to a "<="). 
3. All of the methods listed in the Related Work section (progressive growth, weight sharing, MoEs, etc.) are discussed in the survey "Compute Efficient Deep Learning" (Bartoldson et al., 2023).

### Summary
This paper proposes an interesting mechanism (masked structural growth) to accelerate the pre-training of foundation models. Technically, two main research problems are studied: i) how to determine the optimal growth schedule; and ii) how to design efficient growth operators. Some experiments are conducted to show the advances of the proposed method with a 2.2 times speedup.

### Strengths
- This paper studies a very important research problem in foundation model training. Such a technique can effectively reduce the end-to-end training time of the foundation models. 

- Some theoretical analysis was presented to show the guidance of the design in the proposed method. 

- The organization and presentation of the evaluation section are clear, with the hypothesis explicitly stated in each subsection.

### Weaknesses
- I am a little bit confused by the introduced method; intuitively, it seems to me that the proposed MSG operator would extend the parameter space to a more rugged space when compared with the average-based methods. Thus I cannot understand why it works well intuitively. 

- The experimental results can be further improved:
  - The scale of the benchmarked model is small. Would the proposed method be deployed for a practice scale model, e.g., 7B to 13B or 13B to 30B?
  - The reported results can not demonstrate the real effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of ability to generalize, in fact, it seems that the results are mainly based on training loss while the most important metric should be a set of metric to measure the generalization ability of the model.
  - There should be some plot to show the training loss of the proposed method w.r.t different training iterations, this is essential to understand the performance.
