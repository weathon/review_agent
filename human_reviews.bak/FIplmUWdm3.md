## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unparalleled efficacy in natural language processing. However, their high computational demands and memory overheads hinder their broad deployment. To address this, two quantization strategies emerge, including Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). For LLMs, the billions of parameters make the QAT impractical due to the prohibitive training cost and thus PTQ becomes more prevalent. In existing studies, activation outliers in particular channels are identified as the biggest challenge to PTQ accuracy. They propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes. Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM is able to obtain accurate quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks. Code is available at [ZIP Lab](https://github.com/ziplab/QLLM) and [ModelTC](https://github.com/ModelTC/QLLM).

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed QLLM for low-bit weight-and-activation quantization of LLMs. QLLM consists of three techniques: channel disassembly to reduce outlier magnitude and channel assembly to maintain channel numbers, an adaptive strategy to find the optimal expansion ratios, and a low-rank fine-tuning method to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing quantization methods, especially under low-bit setting (W4A4).

### Strengths
1. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. 
2. The proposed method outperforms existing ones under low-bit weight and activation quantization (W4A4). 
3. The ablation study is comprehensive, showing the effectiveness of each components (e.g., channel assembly, adaptive expansion rate, etc.)
4. The efficient fine-tuning method seems like an efficient way to restore performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method has a significant advantage *only* under very low-bit settings like W4A4. However, under W4A4, all methods (including QLLM) cannot achieve a reasonable accuracy. Take Table 1 as an example, the W4A4 LLaMA-65B accuracy of QLLM is only 59.83% (average), which is even lower than the FP16 accuracy of LLaMA-7B, which is 62.23%. The huge drop in accuracy makes the setting impractical. On the other hand, the proposed method does not outperform existing work like OmniQuant under higher precisions (e.g., W6A6). Therefore, it is questionable whether the proposed method has a practical advantage. 
2. The proposed disassembly and assembly method will lead to inevitable inference overhead when there is LayerNorm or activation functions, since extra layers are inserted in the the forward graph (also confirmed in Table 4, 27% overhead compared to INT8 under context length 256, which is negligible). Furthermore, it is unclear what kind of configurations (e.g., disassembly ratios) are used for the INT8 setting in Table 4, since there is no accuracy number reported under this setting. If we use a larger disassembly ratio, will the overhead be larger?
3. It seems from Table 6 does directly updating the quantized weights (i.e., QAT) is always better than the LoRA tuning. Does it mean if we have enough GPUs for parallelized fine-tuning (e.g., FSDP), we should use QAT for the best accuracy?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose QLLM, a precise and efficient post-training quantization method specifically designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). They address the challenge of activation outliers by introducing a gradient-free channel reassembly technique that redistributes the magnitudes of outlier channels across all channels. This ensures a more balanced activation range, facilitating accurate quantization and improving the performance of quantized LLMs. The authors also introduce channel assembly to maintain the original channel count by merging similar channels. Additionally, they propose an adaptive strategy to determine the optimal number of disassembled channels for each layer, based on minimizing the reassembly error. The proposed QLLM method achieves accurate quantized models efficiently, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 datasets. For example, QLLM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks for the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B model, trained within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU.

### Strengths
- The concepts of CHANNEL DISASSEMBLY and CHANNEL ASSEMBLY proposed in this paper appear to be novel. The findings presented in Table 2 provide evidence for the effectiveness of CD and CA.
- The methodology described in this paper is straightforward and comprehensible.
- The authors have conducted thorough experiments across various settings, which is commendable.

### Weaknesses
## Major Concern:
- While I acknowledge the efficiency of CHANNEL DISASSEMBLY and CHANNEL ASSEMBLY in the form of $y=xW^{l-1}W^{l}$, as explained in "MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION FOR CHANNEL REASSEMBLY", I have reservations regarding its applicability to scenarios involving multiple inputs $X=\\{x_1,x_2,...,x_K\\}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times M}$ and a non-linear transformation $y=\phi(xW^{l-1})W^{l}$, where $\phi(\cdot)$ represents a normalization layer followed by an activation function like GELU. Despite the authors' claim that "the channel indexes for decomposition and aggregation are calculated offline using calibration data, which only introduces a minor extra overhead", I remain unconvinced that the overhead is negligible. 

## Minor Comments:
- It would be beneficial to provide a proof demonstrating that the approximation error introduced by Equation (4), in conjunction with the subsequent quantization error, is indeed smaller than the quantization error resulting from direct quantization.
- I am also curious about the potential occurrence of outliers when employing $quant(W+AB)$ in the equation $y=quant(x)quant(W+AB)$. Additionally, I would appreciate further insights into the quantization error between $quant(X)quant(W+AB)$ and $quant(X)(quant(W)+AB)$.

### Questions
- I am interested in whether the proposed CHANNEL DISASSEMBLY and CHANNEL ASSEMBLY methods can be extended to handle multiple inputs, specifically in the case of $Y=XW$ where $X\in\mathbb{R}^{batchsize\times M}$. I have some concerns regarding the effectiveness of Equations (3) and (4) on $X\in\mathbb{R}^{batchsize\times M}$ if the outliers differ among $X_{i,:}$, as the derivation relies on the approximation of the summation of scalars. Additionally, the authors mention that "with the channel indexes for decomposition and aggregation calculated offline using calibration data". Did the authors imply that the outliers often occur at the same index across different inputs? Otherwise, the effectiveness of the proposed methods may vary.

- The notation of $\beta$ in Equation (3) appears to correspond to $\lfloor\frac{\min(X)}{\alpha}\rceil$.

- It would be beneficial to include the baseline results of $\gamma=0$ in Table 2.

- According to Table 6 and the abstract, the training time of efficient error correction is reported to be around 1 hour, while the total time cost is 10 hours, suggesting that the adaptive CD/CA takes approximately 9 hours. Furthermore, the baseline result of tuning quantized weights directly (TQW) with 4 Attn-FFN Blocks seems to be quite strong, as it only takes one and a half hours with much smaller GPU memory overhead compared to the 16 Attn-FFN Blocks EEC results, and it even achieves better performance. Could the authors provide further clarification on this matter?

- Did the FP results reported in Table 4 refer to FP32 or FP16 results?

- I am curious about the baseline results of tuning quantized weights directly (TQW) with EFFICIENT GRADIENT-BASED ERROR CORRECTION. Did this setting outperform the proposed CD/CA + EEC?

- Could the authors provide pseudo-codes to provide more detailed explanations of the "additional disassembly and assembly layers that are designed to decompose and aggregate channels during runtime"?

- Could the authors further elaborate on why OmniQuant consistently performs well on W6A6 but performs extremely poorly on LLaMA-2-70B with W4A4?

- It is worth noting that "DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF CALIBRATION SAMPLES" play a crucial role in performance. Did the authors follow the same setting as other baseline methods?

### Summary
This work, QLLM, mainly addresses activation outliers for quantizing LLMs. QLLM proposes to first break the outlier channels into several channels, and then merge similar channels to keep the original channel number (by bipartite soft matching). To decide how many channels an outlier channel needs to be broken into, QLLM conducts a grid search of the outlier threshold hyper-parameter $\theta$ using layer-wise reconstruction error as the objective. Then the channel-reassembled network is more suitable for activation quantization. Finally, QLLM adopts LoRA training with block-wise reconstruction error as the objective to restore performance. Experiments are conducted with LLaMA v1 and v2 models. Evaluations are conducted on WikiText, PTB, and C4 for PPL, and 5 zero-shot benchmarks for zero-shot accuracy. The algorithm performance experiments use the W6A6 and W4A4 settings, and the inference efficiency experiments use the W8A8 setting.

### Strengths
* This paper is well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow.
* Motivation: The activation outlier issue is important for quantizing activations in LLMs
* Reasonable method: Channel splitting is a reasonable method to address the activation outlier issue.

### Weaknesses
My major concern in this paper is whether its current evaluation can fully demonstrate its practicability.

**About the inference efficiency**
* While the algorithm perf. experiments are conducted with W6A6 and W4A4, inference efficiency experiments are only conducted with W8A8. I think implementing W4A4 kernels on some NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrating better efficiency-algo. perf. trade-off compared with W8A8 and existing W4A4 will make this paper stronger.
* Table 4 shows QLLM has inference overhead compared to methods without channel reassembly. Does this overhead come from the additional disassembly and assembly layers for non-linear layers? A thorough breakdown of this overhead for differently-sized models (larger models, more compressed models such as 4bit) will help illustrate whether the method is really practical.
* As the channel-assembly process introduces additional approximations, only applying the channel-disassembly process results in the best perplexity (which is shown in Table 2). So, to further demonstrate the necessity of applying channel assembly to keep the channel number fixed, the authors can show the inference efficiency when using the expanded channel number (only apply CD).

**About the algorithm performance**
* I'm curious how much influence the reassembly process still has as the training data amount goes up. I.e., do the authors compare with using only reconstruction-based LoRA tuning without CD, CA, and CP, under exactly the same training settings but maybe with more calibration data (e.g., 256 instead of 128).
* A suggestion instead of a weakness: To raise more interest in using this method, I recommend doing some evaluations on chat models.

### Questions
* Important points are listed in the weakness section.
* Sec 4.1.1 uses $\max(x_M)$ to determine the number of disassembly channels $T$ according to $\theta$, why don't we use $\max(|x_M|)$?
* I wonder whether the CD results in Table 2 use the LoRA tuning? I would like to see the results of using CD without LoRA tuning as a reference.

### Summary
The paper is trying to address the challenge of LLM quantization associated with the well-known "channel-specific outlier problem", i.e. some specific channels in activations tend to have much larger range compared to the others, which will cause difficulty in choosing quantization scaling factor and degradation in accuracy. The main solution proposed is to disassemble an outlier channel into T channels, therefore, the magnitude of each channel becomes 1/T of the original channel. In order not to increase the computational cost by too much, the second part of the proposed method is to search for similar channels and merge them by averaging the activations and summation of the corresponding weights. As a result, total number of channels will be the same as the original tensors after these channel disassembly and assembly steps. Furthermore, a LORA/QLORA-like tuning is applied to greatly alleviate the cost of PTQ while enabling simultaneous tuning of multiple blocks, which is critical to improve model performance (perplexity). Finally, the inference benchmark results show that the proposed method will add ~20% overhead compared to INT8.

### Strengths
1. The proposed channel decomposition/disassembly method is simple and effective.
2. The method to determine disassembly threshold (theta) is reasonable and computationally affordable.
3. Outperforms previous methods at W4A4 on Llama-1 and Llama-2.
4. acceptable overhead compared to INT8.

### Weaknesses
1. W6A6 results are included but only referenced a few times, mostly used in a sentence like "QLLM is comparable with other methods at W6A6." Given that authors in general would like to impress readers by "being better than others" rather than "being comparable to others," W6A6 really doesn't make a strong point in the main article. Plus W6A6 has almost no real HW support... The author might want to consider adding a few more comments/discussion on W6A6 results or moving them to appendix and make the main article more concise.  
2. A little clarification about the inference time benchmark would be helpful. For example, readers might be interested in comparing the QLLM results with other quantization implementations, like weight-only quantization W4A16. Take auto-gptq (https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ/tree/main#inference-speed) as a reference, the "speed" usually is in the unit of token/sec or msec/token. Table 4 only says "inference time" and the unit is ms, which is a little unclear.

### Questions
1. Table 2 shows "Channel Disassembly only" approach with just 1% of channel expansion ratio can already achieve comparable results with the final method. In fact, the reason to use channel assembly is mainly to reduce the computational cost. Author may want to add some comments or examples regarding the overhead incurred by this 1% extra channels, in order to justify the need for Channel Assembly method.  
2. The paragraph of "Inference efficiency" as well as Table 4 didn't specify whether this "FP" model is FP32 or FP16. If it's FP32, author may also want to include FP16 results since FP16 is used as the baseline on accuracy tables. Also it is understandable that the implementation for INT computation may not be optimized. Therefore, instead of comparing the absolute run time, it would be helpful to include the additional Ops of QLLM compared to INT8.
