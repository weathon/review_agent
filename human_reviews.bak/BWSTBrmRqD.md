# DOMINO: A Dual-System for Multi-step Visual Language Reasoning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Visual language reasoning requires a system to extract text or numbers from information-dense images like charts or plots and perform logical or arithmetic reasoning to arrive at an answer. To tackle this task, existing work relies on either (1) an end-to-end vision-language model trained on a large amount of data, or (2) a two-stage pipeline where a captioning model converts the image into text that is further read by another large language model to deduce the answer. However, the former approach forces the model to answer a complex question with one single step, and the latter approach is prone to inaccurate or distracting information in the converted text that can confuse the language model. In this work, we propose a dual-system for multi-step multimodal reasoning, which consists of a
"System-1" step for visual information extraction and a "System-2" step for deliberate reasoning. Given an input, System-2 breaks down the question into atomic sub-steps, each guiding System-1 to extract the information required for reasoning from the image. Experiments on chart and plot datasets show that our method with a pre-trained System-2 module performs competitively compared to prior work on in- and out-of-distribution data. By fine-tuning the System-2 module (LLaMA-2 70B) on only a small amount of data on multi-step reasoning, the accuracy of our method is further improved and surpasses the best fully-supervised end-to-end approach by 5.7% and a pipeline approach with FlanPaLM (540B) by 7.5% on a challenging dataset with human-authored questions.

### Summary
The paper focus on visual language reasoning problems which requires extraction of text or numbers from information-dense images like charts or plots. The proposed method includes a dual-system for multi-step multimodal reasoning, which consists of a “System-1” step for visual information extraction and a “System-2” step for deliberate reasoning. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2 70B on only a small amount of data on multi-step reasoning, the accuracy of the model surpasses the best fully-supervised end-to-end approach by 5.7% and a pipeline approach with FlanPaLM (540B) by 7.5% on ChartQA.

### Strengths
• The paper is well written and easy to understand. Figure 1 provides a good overview of the complete system.
• The paper presents promising results on ChartQA and outperforms prior supervised baselines.
• The paper includes ablation studies in Figure 3.

### Weaknesses
• Novelty: The core idea of the paper is very similar to prior work, including “Visual Programming: Compositional Visual Reasoning Without Training, CVPR 2023” which also uses a large LLM for reasoning and perception modules to extract information from images. Additionally, “Socratic Models: Composing Zero-Shot Multimodal Reasoning with Language, arXiv 2022” also performs zero-shot multi-modal reasoning in a similar fashion. “Look, Remember and Reason: Visual Reasoning with Grounded Rationales, ICML workshop 2023” combines System-1 and System-2 inference in a single model using rationales. 

• It is unclear why the performance on PlotQA much worse compared to ChartQA. The paper mentions that PlotQA “is a synthetic dataset with template based and restricted types of questions”. But this should be easier to solve compared to ChartQA, as the proposed approach also follows templated reasoning steps. The paper should make it clear with ample qualitative examples why performance on PlotQA is lacking. 

• Fairness of the comparison to Few-Shot DePlot versions of GPT-4 and LLaMA: The proposed  DOMINO version of LLaMA has more information about the chart in question. Therefore, it is unclear if the evaluation is fair. 

• Qualitive examples: The paper is lacking qualitive examples from PlotQA in the main paper. The main paper only includes a single qualitative example from ChartQA in the main paper. Examples of failure cases in Table 7 are hard to follow as the associated charts are not available. The paper should include more quantitative examples  which are easier to follow. The format of “GPT-4 Technical Report, arXiv 2023” can serve as a guiding example.

• Additional datasets: The paper evaluates performance only on two datasets. There are also more challenging datasets available: SciCap (http://scicap.ai/). The SciCap uses real-world data and requires high-level reasoning along with low-level understanding of scientific figures. It would be an ideal testbed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

### Questions
• The paper should discuss prior work such as “Visual Programming: Compositional Visual Reasoning Without Training, CVPR 2023”, “Socratic Models: Composing Zero-Shot Multimodal Reasoning with Language, arXiv 2022”, “Look, Remember and Reason: Visual Reasoning with Grounded Rationales, ICML workshop 2023” in more detail.

• The should discuss the challenges associated with PlotQA in more detail, ideally with qualitative examples.

• The fairness of the comparison to Few-Shot DePlot versions of GPT-4 and LLaMA should be discussed in more detail.

### Summary
This paper introduces DOMINO, a dual-system designed for charts/plots reasoning. DOMINO consists of two models: The first model, called system-1, uses vision and language to extract specific information from images. The second model, system-2, is a large language model that decomposes tasks and generates answers. Experimental results indicate that DOMINO surpasses traditional pipeline approaches in handling both in- and out-of-distribution data. With limited training samples, DOMINO also achieves SOTA results on ChartQA.

### Strengths
1. This method is intuitive, and I am happy to see the introduction of dual-system into vision-language reasoning.
2. The proposed method achieves SOTA results on ChartQA.
3. Analysis shows that DOMINO is more robust in handling complex charts.

### Weaknesses
1. The author didn't discuss about the efficiency. How does the inference efficiency of DOMINO compare to the baseline method?
2. The template seems relatively limited, more non-chartQA tasks are needed to confirm the potential of this method.

### Questions
1. What types of charts are included in ChartQA and PlotQA? I think adding relevant descriptions can help people have a more intuitive understanding of the capabilities of this method.
2. Does the author consider the dual-system approach to be universally applicable? Can it replace other MLLM methods (such as BLIP2 [1], LLAVA [2]) and become a common solution for solving visual QA problems? For example, besides tasks like chartQA, can DOMINO also generalize to other tasks (such as VQA)?

### Summary
The paper proposes a two component system for chart/plot reasoning. The system is composed of a DePlot backbone and a LLaMa-2 model, the former used to extract information from the chart, while the later for decomposing the question and give final answer based on reasoning. After fine-tuning DePlot on instruction level tasks and LLM on a small number of hand written solutions, the system surpasses prompt-based baselines and some supervised methods. The performance gain is attributed to the improvement in both decomposition and answering.

### Strengths
1. The paper is clearly written.
2. The results are great, compared to few-shot baselines, and the performance gain is analyzed carefully.
3. The paper proposed a demonstration of two stage reasoning using LLMs for task decomposition using the feedback from perception results, which is novel compared to similar LLM-guided systems without feedback, e.g., [1]. The efficiency of fine-tuning of LLM also supports the decomposition of System-1/2.
4. The authors thoroughly discussed the functionality of each component in the reasoning process through ablation studies and analyzed the error made by the models.

### Weaknesses
A few unclear points are raised in Questions.

### Questions
1. Why some of the results are not shown in Table 1?
2. Why is the correct answer for arithmetic in Table 7 is -50752953286.0?
3. What is the evaluation prompt used when there is no `Describe` step?
4. It would be great if the authors could discuss the applicability of the proposed method on other VQA tasks, e.g. CLEVR.
5. Is there any examples of the model failed at decomposing the problem?
