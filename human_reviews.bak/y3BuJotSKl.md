# Adversarial Defense using Targeted Manifold Manipulation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Adversarial attacks on deep models are often guaranteed to find a small and innocuous perturbation to easily alter class label of a test input. We use a novel Targeted Manifold Manipulation approach to direct the gradients from the genuine data manifold towards carefully planted trapdoors during such adversarial attacks. The trapdoors are assigned an additional class label (Trapclass) to make the attacks falling in them easily identifiable. Whilst low-perturbation budget attacks will necessarily end up in the trapdoors, high-perturbation budget attacks may escape but only end up far away from the data manifold. Since our manifold manipulation is enforced only locally, we show that such out-of-distribution data can be easily detected by noting the absence of trapdoors around them. Our detection algorithm avoids learning a separate model for attack detection and thus remain semantically aligned with the original classifier. Further, since we manipulate the adversarial distribution it avoids the fundamental difficulty associated with overlapping distributions of clean and attack samples for usual, unmanipulated models. We use six state-of-the-art adversarial attacks with four well-known image datasets to evaluate our proposed defense. Our results show that the proposed method can detect \sim99% attacks without significant drop in clean accuracy whilst also being robust to semantic-preserving, non-attack perturbations.

### Summary
The paper proposes a defense method named "Target Manipulation Manifold" (TMM) to defend against adversarial attacks in deep learning models. This method effectively defends against adversarial attacks by guiding the gradient on the target data manifold toward carefully designed trapdoors. The trapdoors are assigned an additional class label (Trapclass), making the attacks easily identifiable. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can detect ~99% of attacks without significantly compromising clean accuracy. It also exhibits adversarial semantic preservation and robustness to non-adversarial perturbations.

### Strengths
1. The primary strength of this paper lies in its novelty. The TMM approach offers a fresh perspective on adversarial attack defense, employing a unique "trapdoor" mechanism to detect adversarial samples. 
2. The experimental section is comprehensive, covering a variety of datasets and adversarial attack types, showcasing the superiority of this approach over existing methods.
3. This detection algorithm avoids learning a separate attack detection model, thus maintaining semantic alignment with the original classifier.
4. The design of TMM allows it to be easily integrated into various deep learning models without the need for significant modifications to the original model structure.

### Weaknesses
1. The "Trapclass" filter mentioned in the paper primarily detects untargeted attacks, while the "Entropy" filter mainly identifies attacks that strive to minimize perturbation. Such a design might not be stable under certain specific attack strategies.
2. It is crucial to evaluate the efficiency and speed of the algorithm when considering applying the method to large-scale datasets or real-time application scenarios. The paper doesn't seem to delve deeply into this aspect. 
3. The L function in the article combines multiple loss components, but it does not clearly state how these components interact or how their weights are balanced.
4. The paper mentions different thresholds (such as ξ and ρ) used for detecting and identifying adversarial samples. However, the selection of these thresholds appears to be based on experience rather than systematic optimization. For these hyperparameters, the article does not provide a sensitivity analysis of their impact on the results, nor does it give clear guidance on how to choose these parameters for different datasets or tasks.
5. During the model training process, the setting of triggers is randomly selected. This raises the concern of whether some genuine data might be mistakenly identified as data containing triggers, leading to false alarms. Additionally, this random selection introduces a level of uncertainty. After numerous attempts, an adversary might be able to identify and bypass these triggers. Researchers should consider using a more stable and reliable method for setting triggers and balance the pros and cons of randomness and determinacy when designing.

### Summary
The authors present a defense method for adversarial perturbations that relies on optimizing a parameterized sum of cross-entropy losses defined over three datasets: 1) a clean dataset, 2) a noisy dataset with points sampled from an $\epsilon$-ball around the clean points, and 3) a trapdoor dataset (i.e., a backdoored dataset armed with a patch and $y_{\rm trap}$ label). The defenses are split among two threat models: 1) the live-attack model, in which a defender receives an adversarially-perturbed image and its label at each step of the attacker's optimization, and 2) the standard 'offline' model. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on four datasets in comparison to established baselines.

### Strengths
- On the provided settings, the results seem quite promising--the method outperforms baselines on four datasets
- Outside of some stylistic issues I bring up below, much of the text was clear.
- The work combines literature in adversarial training and backdoors in an interesting way

### Weaknesses
**Style Issues:**

- A lot of the tables + figures feel insufficiently described. Non-exhaustive list:
    - The units for the FP column in the tables is unclear
    - There are no units or explanations of Table 5.
    - It’s quite hard to see what is being shown in Figure 2 (and looks like the markings were made with pen)
    - Figure 2 claims a 2x2 checkerboard pattern when the image shows a 4x4
    - In a final version of the paper it would be great to add more detail to each Table.
- If I’m understanding the “Loss function for trapdoor” section, the authors are applying fixed patch to a random location in the image with parameterized ‘faintness.’ The explanation of this feels notation-heavy when it perhaps does not need to be. For example most of the variables in $(1 : ch, k : k+m, l : l+n)$ on page 4 are not defined at the point of introduction, and the notation is nonstandard (I think).
    - In general, the loss function seems to be a sum of CrossEntropy Losses over three datasets, I wonder if this can be state more compactly.
- Citations are often formatted weirdly / incorrectly. For example “Zhain et. al. Zhai et al. (2019)…” on Page 3.
- Some terms in the Introduction like “intermediate class labels” are used without definition until later.

**Weaknesses:**

- One of the major points of confusion for me was that the threat model is unclear. In particular, it is unclear what the defender knows about the attack. Do they have an epsilon in mind? Do they know an attacker’s parameters? Do they know an attacker’s algorithm?
- My initial read is that the work is not well-differentiated from adversarial training regimes. In essence they train on three datasets (via a parameterized loss) one of which is clean, and two of which are altered in traditional ways. I’m looking forward to hearing from the authors on this point—may be a misread on my end. However, in any case, this distinction could be better addressed.
- The experimental section feels somewhat limited. One of the major claims of the paper is that their defense works on many attacks, but the analysis of an attacker’s parameters ($\epsilon$, learning rate, etc…) is limited to a single case in the main text. It’s unclear to me whether their method is robust to a higher learning rate attacker that ‘jumps’ over their trap-ring regions in the training data.
    - Their method is based on an attacker ‘landing’ an adversarially perturbed point in the trap-ring of a training datapoint, but it feels like this inevitability can easily be countered by the attacker using a larger step-size to avoid trapdoor region all-together. This potential limitation is unaddressed.
- Since the trap-rings are based on training data it seems that low-incidence in-distribution data is at risk of flagging an attack, raising some fairness questions. As an example, how does the model perform on dogs whose breed doesn’t appear in the training set. These datapoints may not be associated with any of training data’s rings.
    - In particular, I would like to see how the method responds to CIFAR 10.1. It should maintain high performance here, but I’m unsure how the distribution shift will affect the proposed method.
    - In any case, discussion here would be great!
- The ablations are limited. Since the method extends prior work, it would be nice to highlight exactly what performance gain their method contributes.
- Discussion of semantics-preserving transformations is limited. I would like to see the effect of random crops or random flips. These perturbations are semantics-preserving but feel like they would fall outside of the epsilon-balls in the training data. Would these points be ignored?
- I’m struggling with the motivation behind the live-attack setting. In particular, if the attacker has access to the incremental adversarially perturbed images, couldn’t they identify (in pixel space) a perturbation above a certain $\epsilon$-threshold (which the defender chooses) that invokes a change in label. This method would not require retraining and require less compute than the proposed method.
- One of the main defenses proposed (TMM-LA) has very little description associated with it (Page 8 bottom).

### Questions
There are a number of questions embedded into the weaknesses above. Here are some additional ones:

- Doesn’t Tiny ImageNet have 100K examples in the training set?
- “Almost all attacks need to go through the trap-ring.” If I’m an attacker, what is preventing me from taking a learning rate high enough to jump over your trap-rings. Does the analysis of the trap rings fail when an adversarial point ‘jumps’ over the trap-ring?
    - How wide are the trap-rings? How easy is it to land in a trap-ring?
- What is meant by $(1 : ch, k : k+m, l : l+n)$ on page 4?
- Please elaborate on the distinction between this and existing adversarial training literature?


**Note:** Once the above weaknesses and questions are resolved, I'll raise my score. For the time being, too much of the proposed work was unclear to me.

### Summary
Making a model robust requires knowledge of allowable noise threshold, which is difficult to quanitfy apriori, and still faces a harsh trade-off betwen accuracy and robustness in practice. Out-of-distribution detectors are difficult to learn for complex datasets since there is usually a benign noise coefficient in observable data. Shortcuts (or Trapdoors) are a task-specific technique for robustifying models without having to specify the allowable noise. Some drawbacks of these techniques are computational complexity and loss of alignment with the main classifier (due to requiring an extra classifier for OOD detection). The authors propose a technique named Targeted Manifold Manipulation (TMM) based on modifying the gradient flow from the manifold around each genuine data point. The key concept is to force perturbed data points to fall into a new "Trapclass" label instantiated as a ring in the space around the data point. 

The formulation assumes there is a clean dataset which can be used for synthesizing two new datasets, the robust and trap datasets. The robust dataset is created by applying perturbation artifacts sampled from a predetermined distribution (e.g., uniform) to each sample. The trap dataset is created by overlaying patches (triggers) onto clean instances, which then force the trapped instance to classify as the newly created Trapclass. Multiple triggers are created per image to create the trap-ring effect, each varied by both spatial location coordinates and norm. The classifier observes the three datasets and is tuned by a loss function factorized by each respective dataset. The defense achieves a high detection rate and the base classifier suffers minimal impact to the accuracy.

### Strengths
* The investigated problem is relevant to the broader research community - investigating computationally feasible DNN defenses which are robust to adaptive adversaries, while preserving the benign accuracy. 
* The buildup to methodology was well-written and motivated by shortcomings of previous work. The visualizations help provide a clear intuition of the methodology to the reader.
* The authors compared with strong white-box baseline attack (AutoAttack) and a black-box attack. There is an analysis of an adaptive attack where the adversary has knowledge of the trigger placement and Trapclass. 
* The computational complexity is better than baseline detection methods which rely on separate classifiers. 
* The authors demonstrate on a variety of small-scale data that the detection accuracy of TMM is superior to Mahalanobis and LID detectors. 
* The proposed technique does not require knowledge of the clean test sample for detection.

### Weaknesses
* The trigger creation process might induce higher sample complexity compared to the baseline adversarial training techniques, since the defender must generate additional trapdoor data, in addition to the robust region data. The additional data burden isn't measured. 
* The evaluation against semantic preserving attack was weak considering previous work already formulated strong perceptual attacks beyond simple brightness and blurring modification [1, 2]. The significance would be improved if the authors compare against these techniques. 
* It isn't clear how well the method works on large-scale data such as full ImageNet, since it is necessary to produce trapdoor pattern for every image. This aspect is not well discussed in the main text, but would impact the trap ring creation since each mask must account for additional locally sparse dimensions (i.e., the trap ring may begin to suffer from curse of dimensionality), making adversarial search easier. 
* There is no comparison to standard robustification techniques such as random smoothing [3] or vanilla adversarial training [4]. Without these it is difficult to measure the impact of the work to the broader community. 
* It is still necessary to pre-define the noise threshold before training, although a higher threshold seems to imply better detection accuracy based on the supplemental results.
* An important takeaway of [1] is that robustification in one threat model can lead to brittleness in another unseen threat model. My main concern with the defense mechanism is the over-reliance on the genuine data, which may be low quality in practice or in the worst case, suffers poisoning from an adversary. It would be valuable to know the impact of data quality on the detection accuracy, since a real system would have to receive periodic model updates. I would be willing to increase my score if the authors investigated this. 
* The description of the trapdoor mask creation (Loss function for trapdoor) was difficult to follow and could be simplified. Some of the notation seemed superfluous, e.g., trying to describe every span of coordinates and every span of values of the location-parameterized mask. IMO it would be better to just define a tensor $T \in \mathbb{R}^{ch\times m\times n}$ which is alpha-blended and applied as in Equation 1 centered at a coordinate sampled from a range. Let values in $T$ sample from a predefined range.
