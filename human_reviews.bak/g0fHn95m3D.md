- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 1, 1, 8

## Abstract
Accurately predicting material properties remains a complex and computationally intensive task. In this work, we introduce Text-To-Energy (T2E), a novel approach combining text-to-vector encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for rapid and precise energy predictions. T2E begins by converting pivotal material attributes to a vector representation, followed by the utilization of an MLP block incorporating significant physical data. This novel integration of textual, physical, and quantum insights enables T2E to swiftly and accurately predict the total energy of material systems. The proposed methodology marks a significant departure from conventional computational techniques, offering a reduction in computational burden, which is imposed by particle count and their interactions, obviating the need for extensive quantum chemistry expertise. Comprehensive validation across a diverse range of atoms and molecules affirms the superior performance of T2E over state-of-the-art solutions such as DFT, FermiNet, and PsiFormer.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The work proposes a method named TEXT-TO-ENERGY (T2E), which converts material attributes, such as material’s name, spin, and 3D coordinates, to a vector representation firstly, and then followed by the utilization of an MLP block to incorporate significant physical data.

### Strengths
* The paper is written in a clear and concise manner, facilitating effortless understanding.
* The architecture presented in Figure 2 is clear.

### Weaknesses
The paper claims to introduce a novel approach by combining text-to-vector encoding and MLP. However, it appears that the proposed method is essentially an application of existing techniques without significant innovation. The authors should provide a strong rationale for the novelty of their approach, highlighting the specific contributions that make T2E distinct from existing methods.

### Questions
* As shown in the weaknesses part, the novelty should be further claimed.
* Does this method could ensure the translational, rotational and permutation invariance?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes an energy predictor using text-to-vector encoding.
In the predictor, the CLIP is used to encode element name, 3D coordinates, and spin value as textual input into a vector representation.
The vector is used as an input of MLP with some chemical properties.
The experimental results show the proposed method accurately predicts the energy of several elements and two-body molecules used in its training.

### Strengths
This is an interesting trial applying a transformer model for ab-initio quantum chemistry.

### Weaknesses
* The experiments do not show the usefulness of the proposed method since they are accurate in training data. They need to show the extrapolation results, such as molecule results of unknown combinations of known elements.   Although there are results of unknown atom energy prediction in Section 4.2, they are not compared with baseline methods, and final MAEs are not described.
* Since the proposed method can be considered a neural network potential (NNP) using the textual representation of input atoms, existent NNPs should be baseline methods for empirical comparison.

### Questions
* Could you provide an example of text-style input of a molecule?
* Does $e_{evalence}$ mean the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom?
* What are the final MAEs for B and C in Section 4.2?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose an approach using text-to-vector encoding and MLP to predict the energy of molecules. They use PySCF to generate data and using standard machine learning techniques to learn from the data.

### Strengths
It is interesting to use machine learning techniques to study quantum chemistry problems.

### Weaknesses
Nowadays, using machine learning techniques to study science problems is very popular and attracts a lot of beginners in this area. It is fine to make some mistakes at the first step. Here, the reviewer would like to point out some possible mistakes in this paper. 

1. If the authors want to use machine learning to study the problem in a new research area, please check the evaluation metric in that area first. For example, the so-called chemical accuracy in quantum chemistry is about 1.7 mHa = 0.0017 Ha. However, in this paper, all the calculation results are given at the level of 0.1 Ha, which is far from the requirement for the evaluation. 

2. Please check if there is some existing terminology that aligns with your methodology. Generating DFT data and learning them through neural networks is a well-established research area. One can find related algorithms on Google by searching "machine learning force field". 

3. Before creating your dataset, please check if there is an existing dataset that can meet your requirements. As for this paper, there are plenty of existing datasets where the authors can compare the proposed method with existing baselines, e.g., Molecular Dynamics 17, Open Catalyst Project.

4. Please make sure the benchmark is meaningful. For example, a comparison between NN-VMC methods (FermiNet/Psiformer) and DFT methods in terms of total energy is meaningless, because the NN-VMC methods directly deal with the Schrodinger equation while the DFT methods compute the energy through the energy functional.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach called Text-To-Energy (T2E) for predicting total energy of a system. T2E combines text-to-vector encoding with a physics-informed multilayer perceptron (PIMLP). T2E encoder  converts the material name, 3D coordinates, and spin into a vector representation which is then fed into PIMLP for predicting total energy. The PIMLP layer incorporates physics knowledge by using the spin, mass number, and valence electrons as additional features. T2E is evaluated on various elements, small molecules, and untrained materials. It matches or exceeds the accuracy of other methods like FermiNet, PsiFormer, and VMC. Overall, T2E is a strong PoC that leverages pre-trained text encoders and physics informed modules (PIMLP) for predicting total energy of a system. This mix of techniques is novel and hasn't been used in similar machine learning models.

### Strengths
1. The use of a pre-trained text encoder to convert basic material inputs into a vector, followed by an PIMLP with physical features, is an innovative approach not explored before.

2. High accuracy with minimal parameters: T2E matches or exceeds SOTA methods like DFT and FermiNet while using far fewer parameters (~52k for PIMLP). This allows fast and accurate predictions with minimal training.

3. A major strength is the low computational scaling and training times of T2E. T2E exhibits constant cost with system size rather than quadratic/exponential scaling for other methods such as DFT. 

4. Text encoder allows T2E to work directly from basic material names, coordinates and spin. No need for manually engineering features or preprocessing.

### Weaknesses
1. While results are promising, T2E is only trained on a few thousand data points and tested on few handful of systems. Testing on much larger and diverse datasets would be needed for broader adoption. 

2.  Ablation studies that remove various parts of T2E could help clarify how important each component is to the model's performance. This is not explored in the current version of the paper. For example, why was the CLIP text encoder chosen as text encoder? 

3. T2E is benchmarked on small atoms and molecules. Evaluating performance on slightly larger systems (methane etc) would better validate capabilities.

### Questions
1. How would the performance of T2E be impacted by replacing the current CLIP based text encoder with bigger models like GPT-3?

2. Does scaling up the  size of PIMLP  lead to an improvement in model accuracy?

3. Could this approach be generalized to force predictions, potentially making it applicable for tasks like geometry optimization?
