- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
We present Symphony, an $E(3)$ equivariant autoregressive generative model for 3D molecular geometries
that iteratively builds a molecule from molecular fragments.
Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet  for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules.
In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features.
This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of
molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing
autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/symphony.

### Summary
This manuscript introduces Symphony, an autoregressive technique designed for the generation of 3D molecular structures via spherical harmonic projections. Unlike prevailing autoregressive models like G-SchNet and G-SphereNet, which employ rotationally invariant features of degree 1, Symphony leverages higher-degree E(3) equivariant features. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in generating small molecules from the QM9 dataset and offers competitive results when compared to the E(3)-equivariant diffusion model.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well written and well organized.
2. Distinct from other autoregressive equivariant generative models, the proposed approach employs higher-degree E(3) equivariant features. This enhances the flexibility in representing probability distributions.
3. In terms of performance, the proposed method is on par with existing diffusion models. However, it boasts a significant advantage in computational efficiency, as current diffusion models rely on fully-connected graphs that may pose scalability challenges.

### Weaknesses
1. The manuscript employs a coarse discretization of the radial component for predicting the relative positions of subsequent atoms, a limitation acknowledged in the conclusion section. It would be intriguing to explore the effects of employing a finer discretization. Specifically, would such a refinement significantly compromise the computational efficiency of the method? Furthermore, could this potentially improve the distribution of bond lengths?
2. n Equation (1), would it be more precise to describe this as a conditional distribution of $f$ given $S$? does the embedder at $f_{n+1}$ use both $h^{\text{position}}$ and $h^{\text{focus}}$?
3. Typo: In the final equation on page 4, the term should correctly be denoted as $p^{\text{position}}$.
4. On the first line of page 6, the mechanism for predicting the STOP condition remains unspecified. Could you elaborate on this aspect?
5. Typo: The first equation in Section 2 misses a translation $T$.

### Summary
The authors present Symphony, an E(3)-equivariant autoregressive generative model, that leverages a unique parametrization of 3D probability densities with spherical harmonic projections to make predictions based on features from a single focus atom. This approach captures both radial and angular distributions of potential atomic positions. Additionally, the model incorporates a novel metric based on the bispectrum to assess the angular accuracy of generated local environments. The authors claim that the model demonstrates superior performance on the QM9 dataset compared to previous autoregressive models and is competitive with existing diffusion models across various metrics.

### Strengths
1. Symphony uses a novel parametrization of 3D probability densities with spherical harmonic projections, allowing for predictions based on features from a single focus atom (novelty). This method overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches, such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet, which require at least three atoms to precisely determine the position of the next atom, eliminating uncertainties due to symmetry.

2. The NN for probability distribution over positions satisfies normalization and non-negativity constraints by applying softmax functions.

3. A novel metric based on the bispectrum is introduced to assess the angular accuracy of matching generated local environments to similar environments in training sets.

4. Symphony is able to generate valid molecules with a high success rate, even when conditioned on unseen molecular fragments.

### Weaknesses
1. Complexity: Spherical harmonic projections and inverse projections involve complex mathematical operations, potentially increasing the computational complexity of the model. There is no comparison regarding the time spent by the network among different autoregressive generation models, such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet.

2. Approximation Error: Spherical harmonic projections are an approximation method and may introduce errors, especially when a limited number of spherical harmonics are used.

3. Dependence on Focus Atom: This method relies on the selection of an appropriate focus atom; if the focus atom is poorly chosen, it may affect the accuracy of predictions. (not specific for the paper).

4. Challenges in Handling Symmetry: When dealing with the symmetry of molecules, ensuring that the predicted distributions are symmetrically equivariant(although proved) may increase the complexity of the model.

5. The experiments are comprehensive, but the improvement is marginal because

(1) In Table 1, the EDM performs best;

(2) In Table 3, the MMD of Bond lengths from Symphony is worse than from EDM.

### Summary
This submission provides an E(3)-equivariant autoregressive generative model for 3D molecule generation. The use of multiple channels of spherical harmonic projections is novel. The results show the performance is comparable to THE diffusion-based model EDM, but slightly worse.

### Strengths
1. The whole framework for autoregressive generation is reasonable: running message-passing on the current molecular fragments (current state), selecting the focus node, predicting atom species, and finally predicting the position of the added atom. This framework is similar to many previous autoregressive models.

2. The main contribution is the definition of the distribution for the position of the added atom. The representation for $r$ by spherical coordinates and the use of spherical harmonic functions is novel and reasonable for the target task.

3. Using multiple channels of spherical harmonic projections is novel and the authors provide valid reasons for using it. However, it lacks an ablation study to show how the multiple channels influence the final performance. For example, if the channel is 3 or 4.

### Weaknesses
1. I think the Property (3) in page 4 is very important. And many previous autoregressive models can not solve it well. Actually I think it is not difficult to define an E(3)-equivariant model currently as many previous works have solved it well. The diffusion model doesn't face the permutation-invariant problem. But it can be serious for the autoregressive model. The main paper claims the three properties have been proved in Theorem B.1. Unfortunately, I found the authors only proved the first two properties and ignored the property (3). I DON'T believe the current framework can guarantee the permutation-invariant even the embedder is E(3)-equivariant.

2. I think many criticisms of the diffusion model such as EDM on page 6 are unfair. 

a. "Unlike autoregressive models, diffusion models do not flexibly allow for completion of molecular fragments". Actually, it is not difficult for diffusion models to do completion sampling by replacement guidance without any extra training. Currently, the diffusion model works well on image completion and I also try it on EDM, it works too.

b. "To avoid recomputation of the neighbor lists during diffusion, current diffusion models use fully-connected graphs where all atoms interact with each other. This could potentially affect their scalability when building larger molecules." I believe it is even more challenging for the autoregressive model on the large molecules as the sequence could be too long. And the molecules in QM9 used in the experiment are very small. There is no evidence that the proposed framework performs better on large molecules compared with EDM.

c. "diffusion models are significantly slower to sample from, because the underlying neural network is invoked ≈ 1000 times when sampling a single molecule." It is true that for EDM it needs 1000 times denoising process. But actually, it runs very fast and supports batch sampling. I tested EDM on a single GPU A100, it takes 20 seconds to sample 50 molecules (a batch). I think the submission should provide their own sampling time to support this claim. 

3. Though the definition of the position distribution is very clear and reasonable, the current submission doesn't provide any details on how to sample from it after training. People can know $f^{position}$ for any given position, but it is not easy to sample from an energy function. I doubt this sampling process can be very time-consuming.

### Questions
1. Why did you choose 64 uniformly spaced values from 0.9A to 2.1A? I think the model can learn the distribution automatically by equation (3).

2. Since there are 64 spaced values for $r$, I am wondering how you solve them during the sampling process.

3. Can you give some explanation as to why the EDM outperforms the proposed framework for many metrics?

### Summary
The authors propose to generate molecules autoregressively, invariant to Euclidean transformations. First, the authors transform the dataset of molecules into a dataset of sequences, adding one atom per time step. This is then turned into a autoregressive generative problem. Iteratively: a "focus" atom in the past is sampled, then the atomic charge of the next atom, then the position of the next atom relative to the focus atom. By having the focus selection and atomic charge distributions invariant to Euclidean transformations, and the position distribution equivariant, the resulting distribution is invariant to Euclidean transformations. The procedure is made permutation invariant by making the target sequences choose the nearest neighbour next, starting from a random atom, and breaking ties randomly.

The network uses higher-order representations of the rotation group to allow for more precision in the position distribution, which is an energy based model / harmonic exponential family on the spherical manifold. In the experiments, the method outperforms other autoregressive methods, while being outperformed by all-on-one diffusion methods.

### Strengths
- The code is provided and is readable.
- Autoregressive generation of molecules can be a fast alternative to e.g. diffusion methods.
- The method outperforms other autoregressive methods.
- The translational symmetry is elegantly handled via the focus atom. Also the rotational equivariance relative to the focus atom is sensible, compared to rotations around a center of mass, as is commonly done.

### Weaknesses
- in effect, the authors define an energy based model for the positions. It appears from the code that training and sampling of positions is done by discretizing $f^{position}$ on a grid. This seems like a shortcoming of the method, as I suspect that precise positioning is important in molecular generation. The paper should be transparent about this discretization. What type and resolution of grid is used? It'd be interesting to see how the resolution affects the sample quality. If the quality is highest with a very fine grid, it'd be great if the authors could consider and evaluate alternative learning and sampling strategies for energy based models (contrastive divergence / Hamiltonian Monte Carlo / Langevin dynamics etc).
- While the approach predicting the sequence index for the focus point is in/equivariant to permutations of the resulting molecule, it still appears to me that an opportunity for additional permutation equivariance is missing. Why didn't the authors use a permutation equivariant network on $S^n$ to select one focus atom?
- The method performs worse than diffusion methods and don't convince that autoregressive generation is the appropriate method for molecular generation.

When the authors address the gridding issue convincingly, I will raise my score.

### Questions
- It appears to me that the position distribution is an instance of a Harmonic Exponential Family [1] on a manifold, which probably should be cited.
- Can the authors clarify why Eq (4) is smooth wrt the radius, but has a Dirac delta in the direction component? This should mean that the KL divergence is infinite almost always? Or is the smoothening handled implicitly by a band-limited Fourier transform? If so, it's not actually a Dirac delta that's used. The authors should clarify that.
- As high frequencies may be necessary to precisely predict positions, it'd be great if the authors can show in an ablation study that $l_{max}=5$ suffices.
- The authors write about $E(3)$ symmetry, which includes mirroring, but subsequently only talk about rotations and translations. Did the authors mean the group $SE(3)$, excluding mirroring?
- Can the authors comment on the runtime of autoregressive generation vs diffusion methods in terms of the number of atoms? Might it be that autoregressive methods are only faster for small molecules?
