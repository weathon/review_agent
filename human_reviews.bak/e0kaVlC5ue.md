# Spectral Neural Networks: Approximation Theory and Optimization Landscape

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 8, 5

## Abstract
There is a large variety of machine learning methodologies that are based on the extraction of spectral geometric information from data. However, the implementations of many of these methods often depend on traditional eigensolvers, which present limitations when applied in practical online big data scenarios. To address some of these challenges, researchers have proposed different strategies for training neural networks (NN) as alternatives to traditional eigensolvers, with one such approach known as Spectral Neural Network (SNN). In this paper, we investigate key theoretical aspects of SNN. First, we present quantitative insights into the tradeoff between the number of neurons and the amount of spectral geometric information a neural network learns. Second, we initiate a theoretical exploration of the optimization landscape of SNN's objective to shed light on the training dynamics of SNN. Unlike typical studies of convergence to global solutions of NN training dynamics, SNN presents an additional complexity due to its non-convex ambient loss function.

### Summary
This paper theoretically studies several questions regarding spectral neural networks and, more generally, neural networks that are trained to approximate the eigenvalues of specific matrices. The authors prove that multi-layer ReLU NNs can approximate normalized Laplacians, with specific bounds on the error, depth of network, and number of neurons. The authors then show that NNs can approximate eigenvectors, up to rotation. Finally, the authors consider the loss landscape of the optimization and show that, in a quotient geometry, they can decompose the loss landscape into 5 regions (3 that are particularly different).

### Strengths
1. This paper provides detailed theoretical results for spectral neural networks, among other neural networks that are trained to approximate the spectra of matrices, a field of growing importance. I believe this work will provide greater insight into this area. 

2. The authors provide a detailed overview of existing work that is related. 

3. Aspects of the paper were well written and well motivated.

### Weaknesses
As a note, I was not able to follow the theoretical results, so my review is limited (as reflected by my confidence score). However, I believe there are several ways in which this paper could be made stronger:

1. Q1 is motivated as being of practical importance - how many neurons are needed to achieve an accuracy of X%. While the theoretical results provide this, they are difficult to parse into practical considerations. It would be helpful to have predictions of the theory on how many neurons are needed (and how many layers) for a given accuracy plotted (for at least some choice of parameters described in Theorem 2.1). A comparison with an actual implementation of SNN would make the theoretical results especially convincing (if they match up). 

2. Q1, as phrased in the Introduction, suggests that it is unknown whether it is "possible to approximate eigenvectors of large adjacency matrices with a neural network". However, as noted by the authors, there has been work showing success in this direction already. Perhaps it would be better to phrase Q1 as "are there theoretical guarantees that a neural network can approximate the eigenvectors of large adjacency matrices". 

3. Sec. 2.2 is said to be aimed at "constructive ways to approximate $\textbf{Y}^*$, but it is unclear how Theorem 2.2 achieves this. There is not mention of optimization in the theorem, and the number of neurons is set to $N = \infty$. While I understand that the number of neurons can be reduced (in Remark 2.3), this mismatch between aim and result disrupted the flow of the paper. 

4. The figures (Fig. 3-5) were mentioned only briefly in the introduction (before many of the details of the paper were introduced and I was under the impression that they would be referenced later in more detail. As it stands, I did not get anything from the figures. Including them later in the text, as the experiments are motivated (e.g., why it is reasonable to consider "Near optimal", "Large gradient", and "Near saddle") would greatly improve their impact. 

5. I did not understand what was meant in the Introduction by the "spectral contrastive loss function $\mathcal{l}$ is non-convex in the 'ambient' space' " until the discussion about the need for the quotient geometry in Sec 3. I think making this point more clear earlier in the paper would help the reader understand why this is an interesting and tricky problem.

### Summary
The paper makes three main contributions:

* It establishes approximation bounds on the depth and the number of neurons needed for a multi-layer neural network to accurately approximate top eigenvectors of a normalized graph Laplacian matrix constructed from data samples lying on a manifold. 

* It shows that by globally optimizing the spectral contrastive loss function, one can provably construct a neural network that approximates the eigenvectors up to rotations. 

* Motivated by experiments, the paper analyzes the non-convex optimization landscape of the ambient spectral contrastive loss function and shows it to be benign.

### Strengths
* Given the amount of recent interest in using neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions, establishing theoretical guarantees for such algorithms is timely and of interest to the community. 

* The proofs of results in section 2 looks sensible to me, except the question mentioned below.

### Weaknesses
It should be noted that my review did not cover section 3, as I found it difficult to absorb in a reasonable amount of time given the mathematical depth. 

* The theory established in this paper seems far from providing any practical insights on training spectral neural networks besides proving the feasibility of such an approach--at least the authors did not attempt to include argument like this in the paper. Not covering data-dependent kernels as those in HaoChen and most SSL work also reduce the significance of the result.

* The proof of the approximation result (Theorem 2.1) is quite straightforward, combining (known) ReLU network approximation results (Chen et al., 2022) with a Lipschizness-like condition for eigenvectors on manifolds (Calder et al., 2022).  It is not clear whether or not the proof could be useful for future theoretical work in this space. 

* The presentation of Theorem 2.2 and its proof needs clarification, e.g., I found the paragraph following Corollary 5 difficult to understand: "Using the fact that bar{U} is invertible, we can easily see that Y_\theta* ....". Can you clarify how to get this result? I assume Y_\theta* is the Y recovered by the optimal neural network that minimizes the spectral contrastive loss. I also find it difficult to see the reasoning behind Remark G.1-G.3 and how they fit into the proof.

* The exposition of the main theorems can be improved. The neural network family constants are never defined in the main text and it makes Theorem 2.1 very hard to read. I strongly encourage the authors to provide intuitive explanations before/after each theorem to aid the understanding of assumptions used, proof ideas, and implications of the result.

### Summary
This paper considers minimizing the loss function $\|Y(\theta)Y(\theta)^T-A_n\|^2_F$, where the low rank matrix $Y$ is estimated by a neural network. The main claims of the paper are that: (C1) the optimal $Y^*$ can be well approximated by a neural network; (C2) the global minima of the loss function is close to the optimal $Y^*$ (up to a rotation); (C3) the loss function $\|YY^T-A_n\|^2_F$, as a function of $Y$, has nice geometrical properties.

### Strengths
The paper explicitly writes out the approximation error bound, requirements on the depth and number of neurons, of the neural network on this spectral approximation problem. 

It also showcase a few nice properties of $\|YY^T-A_n\|^2_F$, as a function of $Y$.

### Weaknesses
Given the universal approximation theorem of neural networks, it is expected that there exist a neural network that can approximate the optimal matrix $Y^*$. Hence, (C1) should be a natural result. Moreover, most of the techniques seem not new and appeared in prior works, e.g., (Chen et al. 2022). 

Given (C1), the second main claim (C2), e.g., Theorem 2.2, should be quite obvious. (C2) does not discuss the solvability of the optimization problem, i.e., how to find the global minima. Hence, I don’t see a “constructive way” to find the approximation. To me, this part (C2) is more like a result of the existence of such a neural network, which highly overlaps with the claim in (C1). 

When analyzing the loss landscape, in Section 3, the paper does not consider the loss function as a function of the network parameters. However, it considers it as a function of the network output. More explicitly, it is basically analyzing $\|YY^T-A_n\|^2_F$ as a function of $Y$, not of $\theta$. First of all, this “landscape” is not the optimization landscape we are mostly interested in. One has to compose it with the network function $Y(\theta)$ to have the full optimization loss. As we know, the hard part is the network function $Y(\theta)$. Second, given the simple and symmetrical form of $\|YY^T-A_n\|^2_F$, the results presented in Section 3 are not hard to obtain. 

The presentation of the paper can be improved. For example, I had a hard time understanding the notations in the theorems. For example in Theorem 2.1 it is not clear what is $\epsilon$ and $m$. In Eq.(1.2),  $\epsilon$ is used for the “bandwidth” for similarity, however, in the proof of Theorems, $\epsilon$ seems an arbitrarily small positive number. In addition, the meaning of $m$ was not mentioned in the statement of the theorem or its proof.

### Summary
This paper studies the objective of the "spectral neural networks (SNN)". 
The objective is defined by the squared Frobenius norm of the approximation error for the kernel matrix (which is a specific graph Laplacian in the current scope) via its low-rank approximation. 
By the Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem, the ambient optimization problem guarantees that its global optimizer recovers the top-$r$ eigenbasis up to an orthogonal transformation. SNN is a neural network that is optimized by this objective, where the neural network outputs parameterize the eigenvectors. 
The difficulty in the analysis of the SNN mainly comes from the fact that the ambient optimization problem (i.e., when the optimization is done in the nonparametric way without neural network parameterization) is non-convex.

The paper's contribution is threefold. First, the authors prove that there exists a MLP that can well-approximate the top-$r$ eigen-subspace, with sufficiently large number of neurons, under the manifold assumption (Theorem 2.1). 
Second, it is shown that, under the same assumption, if the MLP architecture used in the optimization is sufficiently large, then the global optimizer attained by the architecture closely captures the top-$r$ eigenbasis up to a rotation (Theorem 2.2). Roughly speaking, a good MLP can be "constructed" by optimizing the SNN objective. 
Lastly, the authors analyze the optimization landscape of the "ambient" problem, by examining three different regimes (Theorem 3.1-3.4).

The first two theorems constitutes an approximation theory of neural networks for the graph Laplacian matrix. Theorem 2.1 is a general approximation theory, while Theorem 2.2 is a result that specifically applies to the SNN objective. 
The results in Section 3 solely cares about the ambient optimization problem being independent of a neural network parametrization, but these results are applicable for any PD matrix with a positive eigengap.

### Strengths
Using neural networks to parameterize eigenfunctions of an operator is a promising approach that has a great potential in many applications for large-scale, high-dimensional data. 
In particular, the optimization framework of SNN is particularly appealing as an unconstrained problem, in contrast to the existing work such as SpectralNet which considers a constrained optimization problem.
Hence, understanding characteristics of the SNN optimization problem is an important problem.
The results in this paper can serve as a good initial attempt in establishing a theory in this context.

The paper is overall well thought-out, considering the level of technicalities involved in the analysis. 
The results are well-motivated with illustrations in the introduction.
I think the paper provides good insights for the subject by carefully putting the recent results in spectral approximation, neural-network approximation, and Riemannian optimization, and thus worth of publication in this venue in general.

### Weaknesses
I believe that the manuscript is missing some works in the literature, and adding and discussing these will better guide the reader.

It is a little bit obscure what can be said beyond the graph Laplacian with MLPs under the manifold assumption, considering that there exist other important operators in different applications. For example, decomposing a Hamiltonian operator with neural networks has shown promising results in quantum chemistry, see, e.g., [A].
Also, there exists a recent paper on analyzing the "generalization error" of MLPs in solving the Schrödinger equation [B]. (It would be nice if a generalization error can be analyzed in the current paper, and if so or not, what could be challenge.)

Another line of research missing in the current paper is the recent work on generic NN-based eigensolvers [C], [D] that aim to recover the ordered top-$r$ eigenbasis (i.e., without modulo rotation) unlike the SNN and current work.

### Summary
The paper is a theoretical study of Spectral Neural Networks (SNNs). The problem considered in the paper consists in efficiently approximating an adjacency matrix by a product $\mathbf Y\mathbf Y^{\mathrm T}$. The first main result (Theorem 2.1) gives a bound on the complexity of a neural network that provides an approximate solution of this problem. The second result (Theorem 2.2) shows that a solution provided by the network is close to a global minimizer, up to a rotation. The remaining results (Theorems 3.1-3.4) study the structure of the loss surface by dividing it into several regions with particular properties. The first region is a neighborhood of the optimal solution and the loss is geodesically strongly convex there (Theorems 3.1). Another region is the neighborhood of suboptimal stationary points. These points are described in Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 3.3 shows that near these points there are escape directions so that gradient flow is not trapped. Finally, Theorem 3.4 shows that in the remaining regions the gradient is large. Combined, these results suggest that the considered optimization problem can be efficiently solved by gradient descent.

### Strengths
**Contribution, originality, novelty.**  The paper relies very heavily on previous research of matrix factorization and SNNs such as HaoChen et al., 2021 and Luo & Garc´ıa Trillos, 2022. My impression is that the present paper does not bring any fundamentally new ideas compared to previous publications. In particular, the main message expressed in it is that the considered optimization is practically feasible and the loss landscape is benign despite the non-convexity. The same message is found in Luo & Garc´ıa Trillos, 2022 in a similar wording. Moreover, the theorems found in section 3 of the present paper are extremely similar to the theorems in Luo & Garc´ıa Trillos, 2022. The present paper indicates some differences with that earlier paper (e.g., in Remark 3.2), but they are not clearly explained and seem to be rather technical. The paper Luo & Garc´ıa Trillos, 2022 is referred to multiple times in the present paper, but is not mentioned among the related works, which is confusing.  

**Writing and clarity.** On the whole, the paper is clearly written and has a big appendix containing details of its several theorems. At the same time, there are various small issues with the exposition (see below).

### Weaknesses
In addition to the limited novelty mentioned above, the paper suffers from some lack of clarity.

1. The beginning of the introduction sounds like the goal of the paper is to develop and analyze a neural network-based eigensolver.  My understanding of an eigensolver is that this is an algorithm that produces the full list of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the method considered in the paper gives us much less: first, it is restricted to $r$ largest eigenvalues and, second, the produced matrix $\mathbf Y$ contains eigenvectors only up to an $r\times r$ rotation, so there is still work to be done to extract the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These points are not discussed; moreover, in the comparison of SNN with traditional eigensolvers only the advantages of the SNN are mentioned.

2. *η is a decreasing, non-negative function* - where do you use that $\eta$ is decreasing?  

3. *$D_G$ is the degree matrix associated to $G$* - what exactly is the definition of $D_G$?

4. In Theorem 3.2, the notation for matrices with the subscript $S$ seems unexplained. Also, the matrix $\Lambda$ is not defined (only $\overline{\Lambda}$ is defined).

### Questions
I would like the issue with the connection of the present paper to Luo & Garc´ıa Trillos, 2022 to be clarified.

In general, I think that the Related Work section should clearly indicate the papers that are especially closely connected to the current work, and explain the differences and the added value of the current work.
