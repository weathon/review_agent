## Abstract
Data-efficient reinforcement learning(RL) requires deep exploration.
    Thompson sampling is a principled method for deep exploration in reinforcement learning.
    However, Thompson sampling need to track the degree of uncertainty by maintaining the posterior distribution of models, which is computationally feasible only in simple environments with restrictive assumptions.
    A key problem in modern RL is how to develop data and computation efficient algorithm that is scalable to large-scale complex environments.
    We develop a principled framework, called HyperFQI, to tackle both the computation and data efficiency issues.
    HyperFQI can be regarded as approximate Thompson sampling for reinforcement learning based on hypermodel. Hypermodel in this context serves as the role for uncertainty estimation of action-value function.
    HyperFQI demonstrates its ability for efficient and scalable deep exploration in DeepSea benchmark with large state space.
    HyperFQI also achieves super-human performance in Atari benchmark with 2M interactions with low computation costs.
    We also give a rigorous performance analysis for the proposed method, justifying its computation and data efficiency.
    To the best of knowledge, this is the first principled RL algorithm that is provably efficient and also practically scalable to complex environments such as Arcade learning environment that requires deep networks for pixel-based control.

### Summary
The paper proposes HyperFQI, an approximate Thompson Sampling method for RL using hypermodel as backbone of it for uncertainty estimation of action-value function. Experiments are provided for the DeepSea environment as well as Atari suite.

### Strengths
The algorithm HyperFQI is practically scalable and computationally efficient. The analysis in the DeepSea environment is thorough and detailed. The Atari experiments are also promising.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, the work ignores many of the relevant prior works and failed to cite them/compare HyperFQI against them. In the abstract, the paper says that “this is the first principled RL algorithm that is provably efficient and also practically scalable to complex environments such as Arcade learning environment.” But this is not true.  LSVI-PHE (Ishfaq et al. 2021), LMC-LSVI (Ishfaq et al 2023),  BayesUCBVI algorithm from Tiapkin et. al, ICML 2022 are examples of TS based methods that are both provably efficient and practically scalable. The work also doesn’t compare HyperFQI against these algorithms in the experiment section. Consequently, many of the “novelty” and “first one achieving” type of claims seem to be over-claim. 

The Atari experiment uses only 26 games and uses 2M training data (i.e. 10M frames) whereas the standard is to use 200M frames. At the very least, I would expect the authors to include results of 50M frames. The results provided in Table 4 is very skewed and unfair representation of performance for the baselines. Also it’s not clear how the authors found numbers for DDQN and Rainbow from Hessel et al. (2018) for 2M training data given the tables in that paper represent results for 200M training frames (Please see Question 14). Given 200M training frames, most of the baselines seem to perform SIGNIFICANTLY better than reported result based on Hessel et al. (2018). So, I think it is imperative that HyperFQI be trained for larger number of training frames for better and fair comparison. 

It is also not clear what was the basis of picking these particular 26 games from Atari 57 suite. Even though the paper mentions Bellemare et al. (2016) as a basis for picking easy exploration, hard exploration (dense reward) and hard exploration (sparse reward), the paper uses only a single hard exploration (sparse reward) task namely Freeway in the experiment whereas Bellemare et al. (2016) classified 7 games as sparse reward hard exploration task. Could you provide results for those games for better and fair comparison? In particular, could you provide result for Pitfall, Gravitar, Solaris and Venture as some of the baselines have been shown to work well for these games? 

Regarding the regret bound result, first and foremost a detailed proof is missing and the paper only mentions some lemmas and the final theorem without any proof (both in the main paper and the appendix). 

Typos:
In section 2.1, “terminal $\in \mathcal{S}$”
In Section 2.2, the definition of $f_\theta$ for ensemble model seems to have typo as well.
The last line of Section 2.2 “importance of difference” —> “important differences”

### Questions
1. In Figure 1, why was the comparison made using only 26 Atari games? What was the basis of choosing those games? I would expect someone to use all 57 games or just use the hardest exploration tasks for fair comparison.

2. In the introduction, what did you mean by “randomly perturbing  a prior”?

3. In equation 2, what is the difference between the fixed prior model and randomized prior function proposed in Osband et al 2018?

4. > HyperFQI selects the action based on sampling single or multiple indices and then taking the action with the highest value from hypermodels applying these indices. This can be viewed as an value-based approximate (optimistic) Thompson sampling via Hypermodel. 

What is the difference between this version of HyperFQI and LSVI-PHE proposed in Ishfaq et al. 2021?

5. What is the difference between $P_z$ and $P_\xi$?

6. What is the role of $\sigma$ ins Eq (3)?

7. What is $l^{\gamma, \sigma}_{z}$? It’s not defined. 

8. In Eq (5), what is the role of $|D|/|\tilde{D}|$?

9. For the experiments, do you choose the hyperparameters based of the different seeds from the ones you use for evaluation?

10. How do you define solving the DeepSea environment in the presented experiments?

11. Did you try BootDQN with randomized prior function (Osband et al 2018) as a baseline in Fig 2? 
12. Given the optimistic sampling strategy of HyperFQI-OIS is very similar to LSVI-PHE proposed in Ishfaq et al 2021, it is important to include it as a baseline for the DeepSea experiment. Can you compare your algorithm against it?

13. What is NpS mentioned under “ablation study” of Section 4.1?

14. > In Table 4, we present the best score achieved in each environment with 2M steps. The scores for Rainbow and DDQN are obtained from Hessel et al. (2018) 
 
I checked Hessel et al. (2018) and couldn’t find a table that has result for 2M steps. The tables are for 200M frames results. How did you find the 2M step results for Rainbow and DDQN from Hessel et al. (2018)? 

15. Is it possible to have an implementation of the algorithms in supplemental material? Knowing that the contribution of the paper is both theoretical and computational, it seems important to me to have a public anonymized code.

### Summary
This paper proposes a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm capable of performing deep exploration based on hypermodels. The proposed HyperFQI algorithm samples a random index from a reference distribution, then computes an approximate posterior based on the drawn index. This index is meant to capture the epistemic uncertainty of the agent. HyperFQI is shown to perform deep exploration on the deepsea benchmark and achieving super-human performance on Atari benchmarks. A sublinear regret bound is proved for HyperFQI under a tabular MDP.

### Strengths
This paper provides convincing experiment results for their proposed algorithm. Even though the algorithm carries over the spirit of hypermodels [1], the regret bound seems novel to me. Overall, a very well-written paper with clear demonstrations and important messages.

### Weaknesses
Some experiment results are not explained very well. See questions below.

### Questions
I'm not sure how to interpret Figure 3. The trends in the left and right graphs seem to be opposite in $M$. Could you explain why this is the case?

The analysis asssumes an independent Dirichlet prior over transitions, which is a rather strong assumption. Can this assumption be relaxed? Does the analysis heavily rely on this assumption? 

What is "Assumption 3" in the statement of Theorem 5.5? I am assuming it's Assumption 5.1. Please use hyperref rather than hardcoding the theorem numbers.

### Summary
The paper proposes HyperFQI, which uses hypermodels to approximate the epistemic uncertainty of the Q-value model in a tractable manner. The resulting hyper model allows approximate Thompson sampling for reinforcement learning. On Atari benchmark, the proposed method is able to achieve human-level performance with a small parameter count. The authors also provide a theoretical regret bound for HyperFQI under the tabular case with the finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous MDP assumption.

### Strengths
The algorithm is simple and takes an important step towards developing a practical algorithm that approximates the epistemic uncertainty of the Q-function, which is very important for efficient online exploration and learning.

### Weaknesses
While the method seems novel and principled, there are two big weaknesses of the paper that stand out to me.

The first is the lack of empirical evaluations is one of the biggest weaknesses of the paper. See below:
- The authors put a big emphasis on the number of parameters that the method needs for the Atari benchmark (e.g., Figure 1), and show that the method is parameter-efficient. While parameter count is an interesting metric to study, it is not convincing to me that the method would be able to scale up.
- Are there experiments that show that having large index dim helps on Atari (e.g.., similar to the ablation study shown in Figure 5)? Without that it is unclear to me whether the results on Atari is due to better parameter tuning or due to the proposed method.

The second weakness is the theory section (Section 5). The authors list a bunch of results in the main body, but I could not find proofs to any of them anywhere in the paper. Also, there are lot of missing pieces that could have made the theoretical results much better positioned in the literature. A few examples, 
- Section 5.1: Why is finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous MDP a reasonable assumption to make? What are some related works that also analyzed under this setting and how do their results compare?
- Assumption 5.1: Is the Dirichlet prior assumption important for the results? Do prior works also make the same assumption?

### Questions
- What incentivizes the model to pay attention to the noise? For example, the hypermodel could degenerate to be a normal Q-network
- Equation (5) — is $\xi^-$ being sampled from $P_\xi$ every time the loss is being optimized?

### Summary
This paper introduces HyperFQI, a framework for inducing enhanced exploration using Thompson sampling in reinforcement learning. The paper approximates the posterior distribution of action-values with a hypermodel formulation and selects an action by sampling a noisy index from a fixed distribution, then combines it with the learned value function. These perturbations, caused by the noisy sample, motivate the agent to explore more and identify interesting states. When tested on the DeepSea benchmark and 26 Atari games (2M interactions), results indicate HyperFQI surpasses baselines like Rainbow and HyperDQN.

### Strengths
S1: The paper is well-written and comprehensible for the most part. Data presented in tables and graphs effectively highlight the improvements over the baselines.

S2: Employing a hypermodel to approximate the posterior distribution leads to an efficient algorithm with minimal computational overhead.

S3: The conducted experiments are thorough and provide statistically significant evidence of HyperFQI's strengths (though refer to W2 regarding the Atari games).

### Weaknesses
W1: Although the paper is well-constructed, its primary motivation — efficiently approximating the posterior distribution for Thompson sampling—is not novel. Specifically, [1] presents a similar idea, opting for a variational distribution to approximate the posterior in complex observation environments. The primary distinction seems to be the choice between hypermodel and variational distribution.

W2: The mentioned best scores for the Atari games appear to represent best scores from the 20 seeds. I believe that standard reporting typically involves the average score across these seeds rather than cherrypicking only the top scores.

W3: The experimental methodology, aiming to demonstrate advantages, is not entirely balanced. The paper employs different architectures (DQN nature vs Rainbow vs HyperFQI) and learning algorithms (Fitted Q-iteration vs Q-learning) when compared with the baselines. Additionally, training the model on 2M interactions doesn't exactly highlight data efficiency. A 100K interaction scenario might have been more appropriate.

Q1: Can the authors provide clarity on their methodology for comparing scores obtained on Atari games?

Q2: Would the authors care to address the comparison with the paper referenced in W1?
