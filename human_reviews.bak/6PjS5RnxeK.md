# On progressive sharpening, flat minima and generalisation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
We present a new approach to understanding the relationship between loss curvature and input-output model behaviour in deep learning.  Specifically, we use existing empirical analyses of the spectrum of deep network loss Hessians to ground an ansatz tying together the loss Hessian and the input-output Jacobian over training samples during the training of deep neural networks. We then prove a series of theoretical results which quantify the degree to which the input-output Jacobian of a model approximates its Lipschitz norm over a data distribution, and deduce a novel generalisation bound in terms of the empirical Jacobian. We use our ansatz, together with our theoretical results, to give a new account of the recently observed progressive sharpening phenomenon, as well as the generalisation properties of flat minima. Experimental evidence is provided to validate our claims.

### Summary
The authors consider a decomposition of the Hessian of a convex loss for neural networks that yields the Gauss-Newton matrix as one of its terms which in turn can be decomposed as a sum over composites of individual input-output Jacobians of the neural network layers. The authors argue that, based on empirical evidence, the large (outlying) eigenvalues of the Gauss-Newton matrix determine those of the Hessian (curvature) and the spectrum of the Gauss-Newton matrix is in turn determined by the extreme singular values of the input-output Jacobians. So to understand the progressive sharpening phenomenon and better generalization with flat curvature it makes sense to analyze the input-output Jacobian norm. The authors’ theoretical contributions explain progressive sharpening, the connection between the Lipschitz norm of a neural network, its input-output Jacobian, and its generalization gap for the given input distribution assumptions. Through numerical experiments the authors also demonstrate how the Jacobian norm is correlated to sharpness and the generalization gap in practice and how different regularization approaches such as label smoothing, weight decay, sharpness aware minimization, data augmentation, learning rate changes etc. impact generalization gap, Jacobian norm and sharpness. The theoretical approach in the paper is compatible with the view that loss flatness does not generally imply generalization because of possible reparameterization (the Dinh et al reference).

### Strengths
- The theory in this paper is driven by empirical observations and explains effects that intuitively make sense and that have been observed by practitioners in a way that contributes to a deeper understanding about generalization.
- The empirical results in the paper are well chosen to demonstrate the various effects discussed and cover a large part of relevant regularization and hyperparameter dimensions

### Weaknesses
- The authors argue that their generalization bound (Theorem 6) is superior compared to other generalization bounds in the literature because it involves data complexity over hypothesis complexity. As a reason, the authors cite that datasets in standard deep learning are intrinsically low dimensional and hence the rate of their bound can be nontrivial in practice. But it does not become clear from the paper how the intrinsic dimensionality is estimated in practice and whether that means that it's possible to tightly estimate actual generalization gaps in practice based on their rate in practice (even for simple examples).

### Questions
- The main claims / contributions about progressive sharpening (Theorem 5.1) and generalization (Theorem 6.1) could be summarized or more clearly highlighted already in the abstract / introduction.
- For the paper to be more self-contained iIt would be helpful to clearly list and explain the empirical phenomena explained by the theory. E.g. the implicit regularization through higher initial learning rate / edge of stability phenomenon may not be familiar to all readers.

### Confidence

### Summary
This paper expands on previous work exploring the relationship between the curvature of the loss landscape (the Hessian eigenvalues) and the sensitivity of the input-output mapping of the neural network (the singular values of the input-output Jacobian). The key claim is that these two properties vary together in certain circumstances (Ansatz 3.1), and this assertion is then leveraged to study mechanisms underlying progressive sharpening and the relationship between flat minima and generalization.

### Strengths
I appreciate the work done by the paper to characterize mitigating factors for when Ansatz 3.1 will not hold (listed at the end of Section 3) and then discussing which of these mitigating factors is at play in certain results.  The results of the experiments are generally clear and cover a wide range of approaches to improve generalization/bias training methods towards flat minima.  Sections 4 and 6 were overall easy to follow. 

Note that my lower confidence score is to indicate that I am not as familiar with recent work in this area and that I hope my fellow reviewers can provide additional context on the novelty of this work.

### Weaknesses
**Section 5:** I found the logic of this section challenging to follow.  The paper states "Theorem 4.3 tells us that any training procedure that reduces the loss over all data points will also increase the sample-maximum Jacobian norm from a low starting point."  Where does the loss on all data points come into Theorem 4.3?

The results have a number of restrictions (which are mostly acknowledged by the paper) that limit the applicability of the contributions:
* The conditions under which Ansatz 3.1 holds are not rigorously proven.
* The results only hold for simple distributions discussed in Definition 4.1 and 4.2.  The paper gives the example of a GAN with a latent distribution on a hypercube or sphere as an example of a setup where the theory holds, but in most situations this distributional assumption does not hold.
* The experiments are only on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.  Larger scale vision or language tasks are not considered.

Minor Notes:
* Figure 2: I would not use $\lambda$ to denote the weight decay when much of your paper is discussing eigenvalues of the Hessian.  You could just title the $x$-axis weight decay.
* A recent paper to add to the background section on "Flatness, Jacobians, and Generalization." The work does an empirical analysis about the claims on many of the cited papers in larger-scale settings: Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Maximilian Müller, Matthias Hein, Nicolas Flammarion. "A Modern Look at the Relationship between Sharpness and Generalization." https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07011

### Questions
* Would you say that your work essentially points to the sensitivity of the input-output Jacobian being the more fundamental quantity (vs. the sharpness of the loss landscape) when thinking about progressive sharpening and generalization?  Or would you summarize your work a different way?  

* Does your work result in any new suggestions for practitioners on what training techniques should be used to best improve generalization. Or put another way, what would you say we gain from the understanding presented in this paper?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper studies the impact of loss curvature broadly on generalization through the lens of input output Jacobian.

### Strengths
On an empirical note, the paper has interesting experiments linking the Jacobian norm and the performance of the models.  The paper is well written and makes clear arguments.

### Weaknesses
a) The result of theorem 6.1 suffers terribly from the curse of dimensionality. The authors comment that the data is intrinsically low dimension, however it is not trivial to identify this low-dimensional support and therein lies the challenge to understand generalization in deep learning challenging. 

b) The result of theorem 5.1 is also very hard to parse and it is not clear how it is linked to progressive sharpening? Yes, in order to estimate a $f_*$ and starting from low curvature or low Jacobian norm the network has to increase sharpness during training.  The surprising aspect of progressive sharpening is that the sharpness increases despite presence of many minima which are flat. I do not think the theorem can capture multiple minima hence cannot explain progressive sharpness.

### Questions
a) Does if always hold that the term in right side of inequality of Eq. (9) in the statement of Theorem 5.1 is always positive. 

minor:

It would be helpful to reformulate the statement of ansatz 3.1 in technical terms.

### Summary
This paper explores the relationship between the loss Hessian and the input-output Jacobian via an ansatz, motivated largely based on intuition, by decomposing the Gauss-Newton part of the Hessian into constituting matrices that are also contained in the Jacobian. Some theoretical results are derived as to the extent the maximum input-output Jacobian norm captures the Lipschitz norm of the function as well as its behaviour during training and a simple link to generalization. Overall, these are used to explain the cause of progressive sharpening (related to the edge of stability) as well as some inconsistencies in the flat minima hypothesis.

### Strengths
- The paper provides an interesting perspective on how the loss Hessian and input-output Jacobian are closely connected. 
- There are some interesting but preliminary results on the behaviour of Hessian maximum eigenvalue (referred to as sharpness) and Jacobian norm in different scenarios, with varying kinds of regularization strategies. It gives an impression that when the low value of sharpness arises due to smaller contributions from the Jacobian, then a lower generalization is implied. 
- Understanding when and to what extent the flat minima hypothesis exactly holds is an important research direction. So this work might help towards this end.

### Weaknesses
- **The Ansatz is pretty crude and the overall narrative overly simplistic:** The authors themselves admit the lack of rigour in the ansatz, but frankly, there is a lot of hand-waving that is going on throughout the paper. Whatever does not fit the bill is assigned crudely to the other non Jacobian terms in the Gauss-Newton, and that too is done pretty sloppily by just showing the behaviour of individual terms on their own, rather than their interaction which is what matters. Essentially, this lack of even a basic quantitative attribution can be traced to the crudeness of the hypothesis. 

&nbsp;

- **Theoretical results are fairly simple and lack any evaluation:** There is nothing significant going on in here that is totally novel; a lot of it is based on past works and the rest seems fairly simple massaging of terms and inequalities here and there. The nature of the theoretical results, like Theorem 5.1, 6.1 which are hard to even evaluate numerically, casts a doubt upon their utility and perhaps suggests even the vacuousness of the bounds. Despite all of this, several statements in the paper sloppily attribute empirical observations to their theoretical results, ignoring the fact that many of the results are just pure one-sided bounds which are insufficient to explain phenomena (like progressive sharpening). Other statements are merely speculative, like that about the exceptional decrease in the Jacobian norm in Figure 4. 

&nbsp;

- **Unconvincing empirical results**: The presented experiments are interesting, but fail to be sufficiently convincing. 

   - (a) Figure 1 only shows a very short duration in training and when considered over the entire course of training (Figure 29) the relationship becomes flimsy. Even over the initial short duration, this relation is not as clean, as can be seen in Figures 8 - 12. Further, scales of the Jacobian norm and that of Hessian sharpness get pretty far apart for non-zero label smoothing. 

    - (b) Likewise the particular curves of the generalization gap and the sharpness or Jacobian in Figures 2 and 5 do not give a firm support for their claims. Comparing results across different learning rate values does not give a clear picture of the trend (e.g., looking at fixed values of weight decay in Figure 2, one would doubt if sharpness and Jacobian are even sufficiently capturing generalization). This makes me wonder about what are the actual correlation coefficients rather than just seeing a rough pictorial correlation. Similarly, the Jacobian norm increase midway in Figure 5 also seems a bit weird and the actual correlation seems unclear. Except for the case of the lowest learning rate, the rest of the scenarios are not convincing --- but then one of the selling points of the paper was explaining the generalization benefits of an initially large learning rate!

   - (c) Then the batch size experiments have probably been run for a fixed number of epochs, resulting in less updates when a bigger batches are used, and thus could be a potential confounder in the results. What happens when compared across number of updates, instead of epochs on the x-axis? Besides, it's good that the training loss is shown, but it would make more sense to compare the gradient norm of the loss to compare their relative extents of convergence. 

&nbsp;

- **Literature on Jacobian norm:** The paper does not fully demarcate their contributions from that of Gamba et al 2023. Also, the discussion of Jacobian norms in (Khromov & Singh, 2023; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10886.pdf), their relation to generalization, and the bound on the variance via the Lipschitz, bear similarities to the some of the material presented here.
