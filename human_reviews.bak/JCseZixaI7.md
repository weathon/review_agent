# Meta Koopman Decomposition for Time Series Forecasting Under Distribution Shifts

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Time series forecasting facilitates various real-world applications and has attracted great research interests. In real-world scenarios, time series forecasting models confront a fundamental issue of temporal distribution shifts, i.e., the statistical properties of time series are evolving over time. In this paper, we utilize Koopman theory to address temporal distribution shifts (TDS). Koopman theory states any time series can be mapped into a Koopman space by proper measurement functions and represented by infinite dimensional linear Koopman operator. Therefore, time series under different distributions can be modeled by different Koopman operators. Considering the linearity of Koopman operators, the Koopman operators for representing time series under different distributions can be decomposed as linear combination of a set of Koopman operators, which we termed as meta Koopman operators. We further theoretically show the infinite dimensional Koopman operators can be approximated by finite matrix multiplications and the meta Koopman operators are equivalent to a set of matrices. Based on the analysis, we propose an auto-encoder framework for implementing the meta Koopman decomposition of time series, which is theoretically able to handle TDS. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model on tackling temporal distribution shifts.

### Summary
This paper proposes a methodology that applies Koopman theory to solve the Temporal Distribution Shift (TDS), which is prominent in the time series field. Through Koopman theory, time series of different distributions can be sent to Koopman space through an appropriate measurement function, and this Koopman space can be expressed as linear Koopman operators. Considering Koopman's linearity and Koopman operator, different time series distributions can be converted to Koopman operators. It can be decomposed into linear combinations. This is called the meta-koopman operator. In particular, it is said that the TDS problem can be eliminated because it linearly combines meta Koopman operators for time series modeling in different distributions.

### Summary
This paper addresses the task of forecasting time series data in the presence of distribution shifts. The authors introduce a novel approach that leverages diverse Koopman operators to capture the distinct distributions within a time series, then decomposes the Koopman operator into a linear combination of several Koopman operators. To facilitate Koopman learning, an autoencoder framework is employed. The effectiveness of this method is assessed through rigorous evaluation using four real-world time series datasets.

### Strengths
1. The idea of leverage Koopman operator to tackle time series distribution shift is interesting and novel.
2. The paper is written in a clear manner for the reader to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. A significant drawback of this paper is the absence of a literature review on recent developments in the field of deep Koopman methods, despite the method's foundation in Koopman theory. Numerous works have emerged in recent years, harnessing Koopman theory for time-series analysis, as exemplified by [1-4].

2. Another point of concern is the lack of a comparative analysis with existing Koopman-based methods for time series forecasting, as indicated by [2-4]. This omission detracts from the persuasiveness of the evaluation section.

I recommend that the authors undertake a comprehensive review of recent advancements in deep Koopman methods and carefully design the experimental part to enable a fair and meaningful comparison with these existing approaches.

### Summary
To address the issue of temporal distribution shift, this paper employs Koopman theory in its time-series analysis. The paper theoretically demonstrates that infinite Koopman operators can be approximated through finite matrix multiplications. Furthermore, it establishes that meta-Koopman operators are equivalent to a specific set of matrices. The model is implemented within an autoencoder framework. A comprehensive set of experiments is also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. **Theoretical Analysis**: This paper integrates meta-Koopman analysis into a time-series forecasting model, effectively transforming the data into a linear space to address domain shift issues.
  
3. **Proposal of Meta Koopman Operator**: The introduction of the Meta Koopman operator in this paper offers a novel approach, distinguishing it from the MMOE structure utilized in reference [1].
  
4. **Ease of Understanding**: The paper presents a focused effort to resolve the time domain shift problem, an aspect not extensively covered in prior research, in an easily comprehensible manner.
  
6. **Relevance to Conference Theme**: The paper is well-aligned with the conference topic, as it incorporates the use of a transformer model in conjunction with the Koopman operator.

### Weaknesses
1. **Basic Conceptual Concerns**: To the best of my understanding, the paper omits the usage of 'orthogonal' or 'sparse constraints' in Section 3.2, opting instead to maintain a set of learnable meta-Koopman operators. According to Reference [1], orthogonality appears to be crucial for the bagging strategy employed.

2. **Insufficient Baseline Comparison**: The paper would benefit from presenting experimental results against more state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models, such as 'DLinear' and 'Koopman Transformer.' Additionally, the absence of comparisons with similar structures in References [2] and [3] diminishes the paper's novelty. Besides, reference [4] has mentioned that Linear structure can also perform well, why this basline is not considered?

3. **Lack of Related Works Section**: The manuscript lacks a 'Related Works' section, which could serve to identify technical gaps between the proposed work and existing literature.

4. **Figure 1 Concerns**: Figure 1 is inadequately constructed, and there is a lack of accompanying explanation. Furthermore, the bottom-right portion of Figure 1 appears to be missing from the figure.

### Summary
This paper presents a time series forecasting model that combines Koopman theory to tackle temporal distribution shifts. The model utilizes an auto-encoder architecture, where the encoder maps time series data into measurements, allowing for the modeling of time series dynamics using Koopman operators. The decoder then generates predictions for future states based on these estimated measurements. To handle different temporal distributions, the model includes a mechanism for matching meta Koopman operators to approximate the Koopman operator for diverse time series dynamics.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel approach, and the core idea of the paper, particularly addressing different temporal distributions through a linear combination of meta Koopman operators, is very interesting. 

-  The paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
- When it comes to a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator and its set of eigenfunctions, I'm unsure about the advantages of the proposed method in comparison to other existing methods like EDMD (see the following references).

How does the proposed framework compare to other existing approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?

- Regarding the number of learnable meta Koopman operators (k), it is unclear how to choose the most optimal value for k. Additionally, it's uncertain how this number may impact the results.

- Limited discussion of hyperparameters: For instance, regarding T in eq. (8), it's important to understand how variations in $d_t$ can influence the results. Also, does the lack of uniqueness in T pose any potential issues?

- How does the choice of activation function affect the performance of the MLP? Were other activation functions considered, and if so, how did they compare to the chosen function?

- Can the MLP be replaced with other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks? How would this affect the performance of the proposed framework?

I am happy to increase my score if the authors could address my concerns.

### Questions
1- How is the proposed framework designed to address non-stationary time series, and what are some potential constraints or drawbacks of this approach within this context?

2- Since the Koopman operator for chaotic systems does not have a pure point spectrum (eigenvalues) but instead has a continuous spectrum, how can this method handle chaotic data?
