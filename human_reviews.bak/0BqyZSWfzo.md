# One-shot Empirical Privacy Estimation for Federated Learning

- Decision: Accept (oral)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Privacy estimation techniques for differentially private (DP) algorithms are useful for comparing against analytical bounds, or to empirically measure privacy loss in settings where known analytical bounds are not tight. However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel “one-shot” approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP algorithm. We show that our method provides provably correct estimates for the privacy loss under the Gaussian mechanism, and we demonstrate its performance on a well-established FL benchmark dataset under several adversarial threat models.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method to empirically estimate the privacy loss of an algorithm, targeted at federated learning. The method can estimate the privacy loss from just one run of the algorithm, which makes it easy to apply. This is done by randomly sampling canary vectors, which are presented to the central aggregator as regular updates. The cosine similarity between each of the canaries and the output of the audited algorithm is then used as a test statistic to infer whether the canary was in the training set or not. The test statistic's distribution, both with or without the canaries, can be approximated with simple Gaussians, as the canaries are likely to be orthogonal to each other and the actual update when the space is high-dimensional. The Gaussian approximations are justified with asymptotic theorems, and the whole method is evaluated on several experiments.

### Strengths
The paper is very well-written and easy to understand. The proposed method fairly simple, so it should be easy to implement, and potentially to extend to other settings. The main idea of randomly sampling canaries that are orthogonal with everything else with high probability is novel to my knowledge. Being able to estimate the privacy loss in a single training run, with minimal effect on the target model's accuracy, makes the method fairly practical.

### Weaknesses
The analytical privacy bound doesn't seem like a good "ground truth" for the comparison with CANIFE, as the analytical bound is expected to be much larger than necessary. The best $\epsilon$ to return would be the upper bound that any membership inference attack could achieve, which is of course not known. It is possible that your method is simply overestimating the best $\epsilon$, and is closer to the analytical because of that, and not because it is better at estimating the best $\epsilon$ than CANIFE. This does not seem a too remote of a possibility, as if your result was accurate, it would imply that CANIFE grossly underestimated the $\epsilon$, and simply doesn't work in the setting.

A better "ground truth" would be an $\epsilon$ lower bound obtained from the TPR and FPR of some strong membership inference attack. It might be possible to use your method as this attack by thresholding the cosine test statistics $g_i$, and estimating the TPRs and FPRs that different thresholds give empirically.

The proofs are missing some details, which makes them harder to understand and check than necessary. In the proof of Theorem 3.1, what is the value of the measure $A_d(\theta)$, and how is it derived from the $(d-2)$ measure of its boundary? In the proof of Theorem 3.2, $t$ is not defined. You should also name the theorem that allows you to conclude convergence in distribution from pointwise convergence of the density function, and you should explicitly account for the fact that the density of $t$ is 0 outside $[-\sqrt{d}, \sqrt{d}]$.

These two issues are the main reason for my score, and I will increase the score if they are addressed.

Regarding the challenge to come up with an attack that breaks your method, I can come up with two scenarios where this is likely to happen. The first is not using a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the Gaussian noise, which would allow an attacker to remove the noise if they can break the insecure RNG. The second is an attack based on finite-precision issues with floating point numbers (see Mironov 2012 and Holohan and Braghin 2021), if the noise is not sampled with defenses against these in place. I don't think your method would detect these, as it is only looking at the noise as a real number, and detecting either scenario seems to require looking at the noise as a finite-precision float. Of course, your method is not designed to detect anything like these in the first place, and I don't think any of alternatives are either, so this is not a large limitation, but it should still be mentioned.

Minor comments:
- The Anderson-Darling test should be cited.
- The assumption that $n = o(d)$ should be stated in Theorem 3.3, not just as a footnote.
- Font size in Figures 1 and 2 are too small.
- Table 6 would be much easier to read as a plot of the quantiles, which would also allow showing much more than 5 quantiles.
- Specifying the exact CNN and LSTM architectures in the experiments would be good for reproducibility, as the code is not included in the submission.
- Using \left and \right on the curly braces in Equation (1) would make the equation easier to read.

Comments on references:
- Feldman et al. (2021) URL points to arXiv, not the conference submission
- Capitalisation in some paper titles, for examples "rényi" in Feldman et al. (2023)
- arXiv papers have inconsistent format, for example compare Maddock et al. (2022) and Pillutla et al. (2023)

### Questions
- Is the distribution of the test statistic in Theorem 3.3 (asymptotically) Gaussian?
- What are the upper bounds for the $\epsilon$ confidence intervals in Table 2? It looks like the intervals are huge in the -all columns.
- Which plots correspond to which canary levels in Figure 1 and which epsilons in Figure 2? Adding the canary levels and epsilons to the plots, for example in subplot titles, would make the figures much easier to read.
- Is it possible to use your method to audit standard DP-SGD? If so, how does the method compare to other auditing methods? For example, do the other methods require more than one training run?

### Summary
This work proposes a one-shot empirical privacy estimation method for DP-FedAvg. Instead of choosing canary examples, the authors choose canary clients that releases randomly generated updates to the system. The idea is then to measure the cosine similarity between the overall updates and random updates to determine the effect of canary clients in the overall system. Then using the similarity they determine the empirical privacy using the final model.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Introduction and motivation of the method is clearly communicated. 
- Consideration of estimation of $\epsilon$ for Gaussian mechanism is spot on, since in that case authors are able to prove that the estimation becomes correct asymptotically (in d).
- Experiments with multiple datasets and architectures are presented.

### Weaknesses
- Using canary clients seems more inefficient compared to using canary examples. More resource allocation might be needed. 
- In the paper it is suggested that 
"In production settings, a simple and effective strategy would be to designate a small fraction of real clients to have their model updates replaced with the canary update whenever they participate."
but this would destroy the representation of such clients and problematic, especially, in data heterogenous settings. It would also result in fairness problems. 
- It is hard to interpret the provided empirical comparison with CANIFE. Other than the assumptions for CANIFE, it is not clear to me how this method is better. 
- The authors claim that their method is agnostic to architecture knowledge, but aren't the $c_j$ are of same dimension as the architecture? Hence would not designing such canaries would require architecture knowledge?

### Questions
- I could not see any dependence on canary clients- true clients ratio in your results. Why is there not a dependence on $k/m$ in Theorem 1-3? What are the effects of this ratio empirically and theoretically?
- In Table 2 what is the goal of comparing to $\epsilon_{lo}$, and what is the conclusion?
- I think for a setting in experiments you should also vary the dimensionality of the model and obtain a empirical privacy-dimensionality relationship (by keeping analytical one constant). 
- What is the conclusion of Appendix F? Even if your method is close to the analytical method, do you think that is enough evidence to say that it is a better method? I'm curious if there are any other ways to make a comparison between two methods (such as using Canife in the warm-up experiment). 
- How could one extend this method to other privacy mechanisms other than Gaussian?

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach for auditing the privacy of differentially-private learning algorithm in the context of federated learning such as DP-FedAvg. One of the benefits of the approach is that it is « one-shot » in the sense that it can be used at the same time as the model is learnt, without needing any retraining. It has also the advantage of being model agnostic.

### Strengths
The introduction clearly introduces the context of federated learning and motivates the need to develop empirical estimation methods to be able to audit the privacy provided by a differentially-private learning algorithm. The main challenges that need to be address to realize this are also clearly discussed. Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. 

The proposed approach has clear benefits over previous approaches, in the sense that it does not require retraining of the system or the use of well-crafted canaries. A comparison is also performed with CANIFE, which is one of the state-of-the-art method for privacy auditing. Overall, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising in providing more tight privacy estimates.

### Weaknesses
The example analyzed in Table 1 assumes a high dimension as well as a large number of canaries, which is not particularly realistic. The authors should provide similar analysis for lower values of d and k. Similarly, in the experiments conducted the number of canaries used is quite large, which is likely to have an impact on the model utility. Thus, the authors should also reports the accuracy obtained for the model. In contrast, the values of epsilon used are very high and additional experiments should be performed with values of epsilon such as 0.1, 1, 5 and 10. Finally, experiments with a varying number of clients should also be conducted.

The difference between user-level and example-level differential privacy should be discussed and defined more clearly within the context of federated learning. For instance, how would the attack framework be impact by the change of definition, in particular with respect to the guarantees measured.

A small typo :
-« the choice gives » -> « this choice gives »

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could conduct additional experiments with a lower number of canaries as well as lower values of epsilon to be able to characterize how well the proposed method would fare in these situations.
