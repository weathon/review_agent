## Abstract
Utilizing long-range dependency, though extensively studied in homogeneous graphs, is rarely studied in large-scale heterogeneous information networks (HINs), whose main challenge is the high costs and the difficulty in utilizing effective information. To this end, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and propose an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency in HINs, called Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, to discover meta-paths for various datasets or tasks without prior, we develop a search space with all target-node-related meta-paths. With a progressive sampling algorithm, we dynamically shrink the search space with hop-independent time complexity, leading to a compact search space driven by the current HIN and task. Utilizing a sampling evaluation strategy as the guidance, we conduct a specialized and expressive meta-path selection. Extensive experiments on eight heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that LMSPS discovers effective long-range meta-paths and outperforms state-of-the-art models. Besides, it ranks top-1 on the leaderboards of ogbn-mag in Open Graph Benchmark.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of utilizing long-range dependencies in large-scale heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The authors introduce an automatic framework named Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). This framework aims to discover meta-paths for various datasets or tasks without prior knowledge. The method involves developing a search space with all target-node-related meta-paths and then progressively shrinking this space. The approach is guided by a sampling evaluation strategy, leading to specialized and expressive meta-path selection. Experimental results on eight heterogeneous datasets show that LMSPS effectively discovers long-range meta-paths and outperforms existing models.

### Strengths
1 The idea of searching long-range meta-paths by developing a search space with all target-node-related meta-paths and then progressively shrinking this space is technical sound.

2 The paper is well written and organized

### Weaknesses
1 Why is the search for long-range meta-paths essential? Meta-paths are crucial because they convey rich semantic details. As these paths extend, it's uncertain whether they maintain their clear semantic significance.
2 Long-range meta-paths can be segmented into shorter meta-paths. If we can grasp these short-range meta-paths, then by using a compositional approach, we can understand long-range meta-paths.
3 Finding meta-structures that work effectively across various HGNNs is a tough task. It appears even more challenging to make long-range meta-path searches effective across different HGNNs. In contrast, short-range meta-paths might be more adaptable to various HGNNs.
4 The core idea revolves around creating a search space filled with all target-node-related meta-paths, which is then gradually reduced. Given that RL is seen as a potent tool for searching large spaces, how does the proposed method outperform other RL-based strategies?

### Questions
1 Why is the search for long-range meta-paths essential?
2 Why the proposed method is superior to the RL based methods.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focused on the graph representation learning task on heterogenous information networks. A novel LMSPS method was introduced to automatically select the proper set of long-range metapaths via a progressive sampling algorithm that dynamically shrink the search space with hop-independent time complexity. The overall presentation is clear. The experiments are also sufficient, where the proposed LMSPS method achieved impressive results. Moreover, the authors provided their source code for review.

### Strengths

S2. Using progressive sampling algorithm to search for effective meta-paths seems interesting.
  
S3. The proposed method achieved impressive results in the experiments.
  
S4. The authors provided their source code for review.

### Weaknesses
**W1. Some of the statements in this paper seems to be inconsistent or need further clarification.**
  
In Section 1, the authors argued that 'the receptive field grows exponentially with the number of layers' (for metapath-free HGNNs). Moreover, the authors also argue that many GNNs (e.g., for homogeneous graphs) tried to explore long-range dependency and gained some benefits. From my perspective, the step/range of a path is equivalent to the number of GNN layers in some cases, which indicates that the exploration of long-range dependency may still cause the issue of exponentially grown receptive field. As I known, many real-world graphs follow the property of 'six degrees of separation' (i.e., the average diameter of many real-world graphs would not be very large). In particular, when the path length and number of GNN layers are large (e.g., >>6), all the nodes may be in the receptive field centered at each node.
  
The availability of graph attributes (e.g., in terms of node attributes or edge attributes) is not mentioned in the problem statements of Section 2. However, as stated in the 2nd paragraph of Section 5.1, each node is associated with raw features. Details regarding graph attributes are also not described in Table 8.
  
In Section 3, the authors argued that existing methods (e.g., GTN, HGT, HAN, HPN, MEGNN, GraphMSE, etc.) automatically select a proper set of metapaths but are not as effective as the full meta-path set. However, according to my understanding, the proposed method still does not use the full meta-path set.
  
In Eq. (2), I am still confused about how to derive $\{ \alpha_k \}$. Are they model parameters to be learned or they are derived based on $\{ {\bf{X'}}_k \}$? If they are learnable parameters, it seems that the corresponding scale is related to $K$, which may still grow exponentially with the increase of path length.
  
The training loss shown in Eq. (6) includes the training and validations sets, which seems to be different from the standard supervised learning paradigms. It is suggested to highlight such a new paradigm (e.g., using formal math notations) at the very beginning of problem statements (e.g., in Section 2).
  
What are the training losses for 'LMSPS' and 'LMSPS+label' in Table 2? Does 'LMSPS' mean that it is trained with an unsupervised/self-supervised loss? If so, what is the definition of this loss? According to my understanding, the proposed method is supervised, which relies on the supervised loss as illustrated in Eq. (6). If so can the proposed method be extended to the unsupervised/self-supervised paradigm, where we could only train the model based on the original graph topology and attributes without any label information?
  
Why there are no results for 'LMSPS+label' and 'LMSPS+label+ms' in Table 3?

***

**W2. According to my understanding, the authors only tested the proposed method using the transductive setting of node classification. Its ability to handle the advanced inductive inference (e.g., for new unseen nodes and across graphs) was not validated in experiments.**

***

**W3. Some of the statements in the paper breaks the anonymity of this submission during the review period.**
  
The authors claimed that their method ranks 1st on the leaderboard of ogbn-mag in OGB (as shown in https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_nodeprop/). However, by checking this web page, I now clearly know the names and institutions of all the authors, which breaks the anonymity of this submission.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach called LMSPS for representation learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs). LMSPS uses a progressive sampling algorithm to guide the selection of professional and expressive meta-paths, which capture the complex relationships between nodes in the HIN. The algorithm dynamically narrows down the search space by utilizing the characteristics of meta-paths, resulting in a compact search space that drives the current HIN and task. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of LMSPS on several real-world datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The main contribution of the paper is the development of a new approach for representation learning on HINs that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being computationally efficient.

### Strengths
(1) It propose a novel meta-path search framework for the first to utilize long-range dependency in large-scale HINs. 

(2) It ranks top-1 on the leaderboards of ogbn-mag in Open Graph Benchmark to prove the feasibility of the method.

### Weaknesses
(1) The writing of this article is somewhat difficult to understand. For example, there is no specific introduction to the meaning of meta-path.

(2) In the fourth part, you used DBLP as an example to illustrate that the length of the meta-path affects the experimental results. Currently, most experiments set the meta-path length to 2, and it is believed that longer paths will affect the experiments. However, in Table 9, the length of the meta-path has been It can reach 6, which is contrary to the initial statement.

(3) Figure 2 does not match well with Part 5. For example, it does not reflect progressive sampling search and sampling evaluation. At the same time, the calculation method of the initial weight is not well reflected in the figure.

(4) It is not explained clearly why some meta-paths are used as noise. I hope I can write down the specific reasons.

### Questions
In Figure 1, I found that the results obtained by using all paths are actually similar to the results obtained by only APV. I don't quite understand the meaning of using meta paths? Would it be much different from your experiment to only use a path length of 2 or 3?

### Summary
The paper presents a study on the use of long-range dependencies in large-scale heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The authors address this by presenting an automatic framework named Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). LMSPS is designed to identify meta-paths within HINs effectively, without needing prior knowledge. It includes a search space that encompasses all meta-paths related to target nodes. Through a progressive sampling algorithm, the framework narrows this search space efficiently, achieving a reduced search space that is specific to the given HIN and task. A sampling evaluation strategy is used to select the most expressive and task-specific meta-paths. The results from experiments on eight different datasets indicate that LMSPS not only identifies effective long-range meta-paths but also surpasses existing models in performance.

### Strengths
1. The authors of the paper provided clear motivations for long-range metapath search. The experiments in Section 4 also provide useful insights into the problem.

2.  Experimental results not only show good performance, but also excellent efficiency: both GPU memory cost and computational is scalable. 

3. The methodology introduced is both intuitive and technically sound, suggesting a well-reasoned approach.

### Weaknesses
W1. Long-range dependencies in graph neural networks are often associated with oversmoothing and over-squashing issues. While these issues are typically associated with the number of GCN layers, long meta-paths used may bring in similar problem. Some discussion in this aspect is needed.

W2. Transformers are becoming popular in graphs as well to capture long range dependencies, although they do suffer from scalability issues when the receptive field is too large. Hence, some methods like HINormer (Mao et al., 2023), resorts to subgraph based sampling. By improving the sampling strategy beyond just subgraphs, I think transformers are promising in addressing these issues. Some discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of transformers compared to this work should be elaborated. 

W3. Writing is not very clear, especially in Section 5.1. It is more like a step-by-step introduction of the pipeling, lacking a clear, high-level organization so that readers know which are the important contributions and focuses.

Minor issue: In Figure 2, search stage, i'm not sure if the example 0/1 values given (in the green block) is right?

### Summary
This paper aims to solve meta-path instance selection for heterogeneous graphs. Two observations of existing works trigger the model design, including (1) only several meta-path instances dominate the model performance, and (2) some meta-path instances cause a negative impact on the performance. Therefore, the paper proposes a search algorithm to search meta-path instances from all possible instances and use simple MLP to predict labels after finishing searching paths. Compared with meta-path-free models, meta-path-based models, and NAS-based models, the proposed model consistently performs the best.

### Strengths
1. Motivation is very clear and the experimental results on effectiveness and efficiency support major claims.
2. the architecture of the model is very simple.
3. the empirical results show a strong performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The maximum path length is pre-defined still.
2. Comparison with existing works on the number of parameters should be also added to show how powerful MLP is.
3. The contribution of each meta-path instance is not clear. Will the searched long-range path have a negative impact on performance?

### Questions
1. The embeddings of the target nodes are all learned from neighbors, why not use the node features of the target nodes?
2. How do you set up and learn $\alpha_k$ for all meta-path instances? 
3. Why do you think 2M is a good number for the candidates to be searched?
