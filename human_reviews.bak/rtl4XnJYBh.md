- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Recently, multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) approaches, such as CLIP, have achieved a remarkable success in learning representations that are robust against distribution shift and generalize to new domains. Despite the empirical success, the mechanism behind learning such generalizable representations is not understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze this problem and 
uncover two mechanisms behind MMCL's robustness: \emph{intra-class contrasting}, which allows the model to learn features with a high variance, and \emph{inter-class feature sharing}, where annotated details in one class help learning other classes better. Both mechanisms prevent spurious features that are over-represented in the training data to overshadow the generalizable core features. This yields superior zero-shot classification accuracy under distribution shift. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate the benefits of using rich captions on robustness and explore the effect of annotating different types of details in the captions. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments, including a well-designed synthetic experiment and an experiment involving training CLIP models on MSCOCO/Conceptual Captions and evaluating them on shifted ImageNets.

### Summary
This study delves into the mechanisms behind the success of multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL), particularly in models like CLIP. It identifies two key mechanisms contributing to robustness: intra-class contrasting and inter-class feature sharing. These mechanisms help the model avoid over-reliance on misleading features and enhance its generalization capabilities, particularly in zero-shot classification tasks. The paper also highlights the positive impact of rich, detailed captions for improving model robustness.

### Strengths
1. Task importance: This work addresses essential aspects of multimodal contrastive learning, pivotal for AI's real-world performance.

2. Theoretical analysis: The study underscores the necessity of moving beyond surface-level results and engaging in deep theoretical scrutiny to truly understand the mechanisms that drive successful outcomes in contrastive learning.

3. Interesting discoveries: The research brings to light interesting insights, particularly around intra-class contrasting and inter-class feature sharing,

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of distinction from traditional approaches: The research does not sufficiently differentiate multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) from traditional single-modality contrastive learning. It's unclear what unique perspectives MMCL brings compared to these established analyses for conventional contrastive learning. Clarifying this distinction is crucial for understanding the specific contributions and innovations of MMCL.

2. Assumptions about feature learning: The paper posits that intra-class contrasting allows for the learning of high-variance features, leading to the acquisition of generalizable core features beneficial for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially when annotated with text. However, it does not adequately explain or justify why this effect occurs. A more thorough explanation is needed to understand how intra-class contrasting specifically contributes to OOD generalization.

3. Need for more intuitive theoretical explanations: The theoretical analysis could benefit from more intuitive explanations, examples, or visual aids. As it stands, the theoretical aspects may be challenging for readers to fully grasp, especially those unfamiliar with complex concepts in contrastive learning. Simplifying these explanations could make the research more accessible and understandable.

4. Limitations of experiments: The credibility of the observations is somewhat compromised by the scale and nature of the experiments conducted. The use of small-scale or toy experiments raises questions about the findings' applicability in more complex, real-world scenarios. Future research would benefit from more extensive, large-scale experiments to test the theories in environments that more closely mimic real-world applications.

5. Implications for method design of contrastive learning: The study falls short in outlining how the observations made could influence future designs of contrastive learning methods. While it discusses the mechanisms of MMCL and their benefits, there is a gap in guidance on applying these insights to the practical construction or improvement of next-generation contrastive learning models. Providing clearer, more detailed pathways from observation to application would enhance the paper's utility for future research and development in the field.

### Summary
This paper investigates multimodal contrastive learning(MMCL) mechanism that leads to its superior robustness in zero-shot classification/Out-of-distribution tasks. The paper attributes such benefit to MMCL loss that features 1) intra-class contrasting, which enables the model to learn features with high variance (such as core features) than relying on the spurious features that usually have smaller variance (easier to learn as shortcut); 2) inter-class feature sharing such that captions/features in a different class that contains useful information about another class can be learned. Both experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets are performed to validate the theoretical analysis.

### Strengths
Overall this paper investigates an interesting problem from a theoretical perspective and provides insights on the mechanism of multimodal contrastive learning and why it learns more robust features compared to supervised learning. 

The analytical framework is sound, and the exposition is straightforward. 

The conclusions drawn make sense and explain why rich text description is desired and why MMCL tends to be more robust to spurious features compared to supervised learning.

The experiments section includes both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the setup is interesting and validates the theoretical findings.

### Weaknesses
For the theoretical analysis part, section 4.6 could benefit from more clarification on the notation and its indications.

For the experiments part, the training dataset (MSCOCO) scale is relatively smaller compared to testing (ImageNet and its variations).

Overall I think this is a sound paper and I have a few questions listed in the Questions section.

Some related works studying multimodal learning and how each modality could interact with and complement each other could be considered to be included in related works such as:

### Questions
1. In assumption 4.2, is it always true that spurious features have a smaller variance? Sometimes the background features are treated as spurious features and there can be backgrounds that have high variance. How is $\sigma_{spu} = O(1/\sqrt{logn})$ determined?
2. In section 4.2.1, more explanation on the setup and use of notation might help with understanding. Such as what are the indications of $\beta$ and $\alpha$? What is the meaning and usage of c? And what does coordinate k mean?
3. Does rich details in the captions correlate with a high variance of features?
4. In the experiments section, how is the different accuracy on In-domain distribution obtained?
5. As the dataset scale is very different, the accuracy on ImageNet is quite small. Is CLIP trained from scratch on MSCOCO? Usually, CLIP models pre-trained on MSCOCO are evaluated on Flick30K. Are the numbers in Figure 2 reported as the average of ImageNet and its variations? To represent ID and OOD distribution, maybe it makes more sense to pre-train on ImageNet original version and evaluate on domain-shifted versions? In Figure.2b, the accuracy drops a lot as the label approach accuracy increases, does this indicate overfitting on the labels?
6. One comma missing on page 4, the second last line. "independently of each other"

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper is a study on the distribution-shift robustness of multi-modal contrastive learning (MMCL) compared with supervised learning (SL). The authors provide formal definitions of MMCL and SL, and define robustness evaluation metrics for each of them. They provide both theoretical and empirical results in their paper.

### Strengths
- The results are shown in both theoretical proofs and empirical experiments, providing a thorough analysis of MMCL and SL.
- For the theoretical parts, the conclusions look well-supported.
- The conclusions are useful in developing new MMCL methods, in the direction of loss function and data filtering and representation.

I am not a machine learning theoretical researcher, and I do not major in this direction. Therefore, I am unable to check the theoretical analysis carefully.

### Weaknesses
- There should be more points in Fig.2 to better show the conclusion. Given just 4~5 points, the observation is not very convincing. In Fig.2(b), the linear approximation for "label" is a little far-fetched.
- Only one dataset, namely MSCOCO, is used in "robustness on real data", making the results less convincing. More datasets should be used here.
- For the empirical parts, the authors did not mention which backbone (e.g., ResNet50 or ViT-base) they used for the evaluation. This might significantly affect the resulting accuracy. It is also interesting to investigate the performance difference between different backbones.

### Questions
- Is there a way to qualitatively describe the derived or observed conclusions, beyond just "at this robustness is attributed to aspects of the MMCL loss function, i.e. (1) intra-class contrasting (2) inter-class feature sharing, as well as the nature of multi-modal data i.e. (3) richness of captions"?
-The semi-synthetic experiment seems not make much sense, as the task is too simple and the data is limited. Could you please explain the reason for using this dataset?

### Summary
This paper explores the mechanisms behind learning generalizable representations and robustness to distribution shift of existing multi-modal contrastive learning (MMCL) approaches such as CLIP. The theoretical findings attribute the superior robustness to MMCL loss and rich text annotations, specifically to the two mechanisms - (1) intra-class contrasting between image-text pairs, and (2) inter-class feature sharing enabled by MMCL loss. The theoretical findings are validated through experiments using synthetic dataset based on MNIST and robustness study on MS COCo/ImageNet shifted versions.

### Strengths
The paper presents a theoretical perspective of the multi-modal contrastive learning (MMCL) method's robustness to distribution shift, supporting the empirical findings from prior works such as CLIP. The work shows insights of using rich text annotations and explains how MMCL loss helps to learn representations with superior robustness against distribution shifts.

### Weaknesses
- The paper generalizes training with cross-entropy loss as the supervised learning, but there is class of supervised learning approaches based on contrastive learning/loss [Khosla 2020]. It is not a fair comparison to say the study is about supervised learning and MMCL
- The study is based on a linearized contrastive loss function, so it not clear what is the effect of other variations of contrastive loss functions. Also, there is no supporting validation on if the robustness is due to single modality v/s multi-modality or cross-entropy v/s contrastive loss.
- Lack of details on the experimental study. I suggest authors provide details on experimental setup and distribution shift study/datasets (at least in the appendix, if not able to provide all details in main manuscript)

### Questions
- What are the six versions of shifted ImageNet used for evaluation? Is the entire test set from ImageNet-A, ImagetNet-Sketch, ImageNet-v2, ImageNet-R and ObjectNet are used for evaluation?
- Why not consider domain generalization benchmarks such as domainbed [Gulrajani 2020] for distribution shift robustness evaluation?
- I encourage authors to consider including prior works in the contrastive learning paradigm in the related works section for the readers to get the broader perspective on contrastive learning.
