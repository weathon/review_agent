# CLIP as Multi-Task Multi-Kernel Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a foundational model that learns a latent embedding space through an inner product-based objective. In this paper, we provide a theoretical interpretation of CLIP utilizing Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework. Specifically, we reformulate the problem of estimating the infinite-dimensional mapping with a neural network as selecting an unknown RKHS using multiple kernel learning. Such connection motivates us to propose to estimate the CLIP embedding via the multi-task multi-kernel (MTMK) method: we reformulate the different labels in the CLIP training data as the multiple training tasks, and reformulate learning the unknown CLIP embedding as choosing an optimal kernel from a family of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, which is computationally more efficient. Utilizing the MTMK interpretation of CLIP, we also show an optimal statistical rate of the MTMK classifier under the scenario that both the number of covariates and the number of candidate kernels can increase with the sample size. Besides the synthetic simulations, we apply the proposed method to align the medical imaging data with the clinical codes in electronic health records and illustrate that our approach can learn the proper kernel space aligning the imaging embedding with the text embeddings with high accuracy.

### Summary
This paper casts the problem of estimating high dimensional neural networks mappings as selecting an unknown Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using the optimal solution of a multi-task multiple kernel learning (MTMKL) optimization problem. Under the setting where both number of covariates and the number of candidate kernels increase with the sample size, the authors show an optimal statistical rate of the MTMKL classifier. The proposed method is successfully applied to embeddings of medical imaging data.

### Strengths
- Casting the high dimensional neural networks optimization problem as multi-task multiple learning optimization problem
- Thorough theoretical analysis of the optimal estimator

### Weaknesses
- CLIP is not considered in the experiments! This paper should not be sold as CLIP modelling but as a method that use inner-product based objective.
- Claim that there were no prior theoretical work on multi-task multiple kernel learning. There are multiple work on the subject (this is an old topic) including theoretical analysis. See (Micchelli, C., & Pontil, M. (2004). Kernels for Multi--task Learning. Advances in neural information processing systems, 17.)

### Questions
- I have a big concern about the title of the paper. I do not see why the results in the paper are only specialized to CLIP models instead of general estimating functionals of high dimensional (features embeddings) inner products. In the experimental section, CLIP is barely used! Some embeddings are just extracted. I think if the paper is around CLIP as Multi-task multiple kernel, there should be a whole study on the architecture of CLIP, which to me seems to be a big task. Could the authors please elaborate more on this as this is really confusing to me about the real contribution of the paper? 
-It is mentioned in the Related literature that no theoretical analysis of MKL has been conductied in the multi-task setting. Could the authors justify that as there is a big literature on the subject. For instance: See (Micchelli, C., & Pontil, M. (2004). Kernels for Multi--task Learning. Advances in neural information processing systems, 17.) which has not been cited/analysed. There are other related works. Could the authors elaborate on this?
- In the experiments section (section 7.2), the authors do not specify which embeddings are used (are they CLIP embeddings?), justifying again my concerns of why CLIP as a motivation of the paper? If so, more detailed experiments should be performed using CLIP embeddings for large-scale image recognition problem (this is a big literature to be considered).


------- After rebuttal ---------------------
The work conducted by the authors during the rebuttal phase convinced me to raise my score. My original concern was that the paper was focused on proposing a new way of training CLIP-like models but the experimental sections did not compare with respect to the traditional way of training CLIP. The authors have done this comparison in the rebuttal phase and have shown improvements of their MTMK approach over CLIP, and promised to revise the paper to include that as one of the message of the paper by including it as an algorithm for training CLIP.

### Summary
The paper tries to achieve better understanding and analysis of CLIP using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). CLIP uses a contrastive loss on mapping of input text and image datasets. The paper argues that the objective function of CLIP can be expressed by using kernels in an RKHS. Then the paper proposes to find the best RKHS that maximizes the contrastive loss of CLIP.

### Strengths
1. Interpreting the training CLIP as a kernel learning problem is interesting. Due to characteristics of kernel functions analyzing kernel-based models is tractable. This perspective offers a promising avenue for enhancing the understanding of CLIP, a fundamental and widely adopted model.
2. The paper conducted experiments on real datasets to support the theoretical analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. It seems that the goal of the paper is to give readers of better understanding on how to train a better CLIP model. It is more common that neural network models are employed. However, I did not find any discussion in the paper that if their analysis provides some intuition on how  train a better CLIP. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is not super clear to me.
2. The methods used in this paper is too heuristics. In case of using neural networks, deep neural network models can be interpreted as NTK using some heuristics while in order to train the contrastive loss using kernel learning, the paper performs some relaxations in the objective function.
3. Experimental section can be improved by adding more datasets and baselines.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors first derive relations between CLIP and multi-task multi kernel (MTMK) learning. Then, using the established relations, they discuss MTMK Logistic regression, where they also discuss on the various regularization choices such as L1, L2, Group Lasso and combination of them. They derive the conditions for the consistency of the estimator. 
The numerical experiments show the proposed schemes (involving various combinations of the regularizers) achieve better performance in synthetic and real datasets in contrast to baselines such as SVM and LR.

### Strengths
- In Section 6, The theoretical study of the convergence of the estimators under multi task multi kernel setup is interesting. 
- It is an interesting attempt to study the relations between the kernel methods to the pretraining steps in CLIP

### Weaknesses
- It is not clear about the focus of the paper. While the primary motivation has been understanding CLIP, the latter part of the paper doesn't offer any discussions, neither there are any experimental comparisons to that of CLIP. 

- It was difficult (for the reviewer) to understand and comprehend the main equivalances. It would be great to have clarifications or if the writing is improved to clear the confusions. Examples below:
1. The notation itself is a bit confusing to understand. While CLIP uses pseudolabels, which have n different values for n samples, this paper has a notation T for the classes and n for the samples. It would be easier to have a clear writeup on the dataset construction before proceeding to the next equivalances. 

2. It is not very clear how equation 2.1 represents CLIP. Since in CLIP, the inner product is computed between a text representation of sample i and image representation of sample j. Here, it is assumed that \phi captures both. It would be nice to provide a concrete reference to show that CLIP objective is max_H C^D_H, as mentioned in the paper. 


3. It is difficult to understand the correlate the final reduction in page 5 (the equation on the top) to that of CLIP. Because CLIP labels are defined for pairs, and here the label is defined for a sample.

- The experimental section is not in line with the initial claims of the paper.

### Questions
- What happens if we assume that the CLIP objective (2.1) has dot(\phi_I(x_i), \phi_t(x_j)) corresponding to the image and text embeddings. Are the results discussed in this paper hold without any loss of generality ?

- In 2.7, Is y_ti one hot encoding of the ith sample ?

- It might be better to read if better rigour had been followed, for instance in defining what category the loss function f belongs to. The equations 2.2-2.7 mention maximization with a loss function, while it is changed to min at the end. Probably this is a typo. 

- In the synthetic experiments, more explanation might be needed on the ground truth function. And some explanation would be needed why the MTMK-L1 worked best in relation to the true model. 

- Since the model is motivated from CLIP, how do we compare against tasks which are used for evaluating CLIP
