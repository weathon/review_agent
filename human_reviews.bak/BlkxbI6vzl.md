## Abstract
We study the sparse phase retrieval problem, which seeks to recover a sparse signal from a limited set of magnitude-only measurements. In contrast to prevalent sparse phase retrieval algorithms that primarily use first-order methods, we propose an innovative second-order algorithm that employs a Newton-type method with hard thresholding. This algorithm overcomes the linear convergence limitations of first-order methods while preserving their hallmark per-iteration computational efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees that our algorithm converges to the $s$-sparse ground truth signal $\boldsymbol{x}^{\natural} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (up to a global sign) at a quadratic convergence rate after at most $O(\log (\Vert\boldsymbol{x}^{\natural} \Vert /x_{\min}^{\natural}))$ iterations, using $\Omega(s^2\log n)$ Gaussian random samples. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm achieves a significantly faster convergence rate than state-of-the-art methods.

### Summary
This paper investigates the sparse phase retrieval problem, which seeks to reconstruct an unknown $s$-sparse vector $x$ from $m$ measurements $y_i=\langle a_i, x\rangle^2$. This problem has been extensively studied, and several first- and second-order methods have been developed. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a second-order algorithm for sparse phase retrieval. The cost per iteration is $\tilde{O}(s^4+s^2n^2)$, and the number of iterations is $\log \log (1/\epsilon)+\log (\|x\|/x_{\min})$. The algorithm also considers noisy measurements and proves a linear convergence rate. Additionally, the paper conducts several experiments in different parameter regimes and compares the new algorithm's performance with previous algorithms. The experimental results show that the new algorithm has significant advantages in efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.

### Strengths
The problem studied in this paper is of great significance in both theory and practice. The new fast algorithm proposed here can be utilized for a variety of real-world applications. Theoretically, the time complexity for each iteration of the algorithm matches the previous state-of-the-art first-order method, while the number of iterations improves on all previous first- and second-order methods. This is an essential theoretical improvement. Empirically, the proposed algorithm can be efficiently implemented and runs very fast and robustly. Furthermore, this paper is well-written, and most statements appear to be mathematically sound to me.

### Weaknesses
The super-linear convergence rate of the iterative method requires a warm start, meaning that it only holds after $K$ iterations. The main text of this paper does not provide enough intuition for why this initialization is necessary. Second, the initial point of the iterative method is generated via the sparse spectral initialization method by Jagatap and Hegde (2019). This makes the whole algorithm quite complicated. Third, it is unclear what are the technical differences between this paper and the papers by Cai et al. (2016) and Cai et al. (2022). It seems that the proofs in this paper rely on several technical lemmas from previous works.

### Questions
1. Page 2, bullet 2: what is |x|?
2. Page 2, bullet 2: “It is important to emphasize…” Note that the non-asymptotic convergence of Newton's methods has been studied in many optimization problems in theoretical computer science and optimization. It is indeed interesting to obtain an iteration bound for the sparse phase retrieval problem. But this emphasis seems to be unnecessary.
3. Page 3, Sec. 2.1: the formulation of the problem is unclear. For example, are the sensing vectors $a_i$ fixed or chosen by the algorithm?
4. Table 1: it would be better to add references to these methods.
5. Is there any lower bound on the computation complexity of this problem? 
6. Page 4, Sec. 3.1: $O(n^3)$ can be replaced with $n^{\omega}$ using fast matrix multiplication since you are referring to the complexity. 
7. Page 4: “We identify the set of free variables using one-step IHT”, IHT is not defined.
8. Eq. (4): is there a closed-form expression for the s-sparse hard thresholding? Does it just pick the s largest magnitude entries of the input vector?
9. Bottom of Page 4: is there any intuition as to why using f_A for free variable identification can improve the algorithm? 
10. Thm. 3.1: “ There exists positive constant” -> “ exist”
11. Thm. 3.1: what is the convergence rate of the first K iterations?
12. Thm. 3.1: what’s the scale of $\rho$? Is it smaller than 1 or bigger than 1?
13. Thm 3.2: in this theorem, the convergence rate is characterized for the first K iteration. Why is this different from the noiseless case? Does it mean the algorithm is not robust in a long time?
14. Lem. B.2: Does $A_S$ mean the principal sub-matrix indexed by $S$? Or does it only include the rows in $S$? How tight is this lemma?
15. Lem. B.4: why $r=s$ and $s’$? Is it a typo here? Also, what is $\delta_{s+s’}$?
16. Lem. B.7: $\mathcal{T}$ is not defined here.
17. Eq. (29): it would be better to recall what is $p$ here.
18. Proof of Thm 3.1: It actually shows a linear convergence rate for the first K iterations. After that, the support of the ground-truth vector is fixed, and the quadratic convergence appears. It seems that in the fast-convergence phase, the algorithm uses Newton’s method to solve a general phase retrieval problem (without sparsity) of dimension $s$. Is the quadratic convergence rate known before for this problem?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new (second order) algorithm for the sparse phase retrieval problem, which is based on Newton projection. The algorithm is proven to converge to the ground truth at a quadratic convergence rate. This paper also provides various experiments to demonstrate its performance against SOTA algorithm (e.g., with/without noise and phase transition plots).

### Strengths
1. This paper is easy to follow for audience with phase retrieval background.
2. Theoretical results for both with/without noise are provided.
3. Experiments are sufficient, and demonstrate its performance against SOTA algorithms. I really like the phase transition plot, which will be asked to do so if it is not provided.

### Weaknesses
Although it is easy to follow for audience with phase retrieval background, I suggest authors to provide more details such as intuitions and figures of geometry to improve the readability for a broader audience. A good example will be ``Yuxin Chen and Emmanuel J Candès. Solving random quadratic systems of equations is nearly as easy as solving linear systems. Communications on pure and applied mathematics, 70(5):822–883, 2017.'' I will raise my rating if it could be realized.

### Summary
This paper proposes a second-order Newton-type algorithm for solving the sparse phase retrieval problems. It is shown that the algorithm enjoys a quadratic convergence rate with similar sample complexies relative to existing algorithms. Numerical tests verify the theoretical findings.

### Strengths
+ The design of the algorithm is interesting and delicate which is different than the existing sparse PR algorithms based on hard/soft thresholding. 
+ The paper is easy to follow.
+ Extensive convincing numerical results.

### Weaknesses
- The first stage of finding the initialization is not reinvented. 
- Known sparsity level s a priori.
- When noise is considered, the convergence rate recovers that of the first-order algorithms. In practice, all measurements are noisy. Please explain what is the advantage of the proposed algorithm for practical settings then.

### Questions
In different papers of sparse PR, SPARTA performs better and faster than e.g., ThWF; see e.g., the paper CoPRAM. It is strange why SPARTA is the worst performing method in almost all tests provided here. Please explain and replicate an experimental setting in SPARAT or CoPRAM paper using all methods.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors address the sparse phase retrieval problem, which focuses on the recovery of a sparse signal from a limited number of phaseless measurements. The authors propose an efficient second-order algorithm based on Newton's projection, which maintains the same per-iteration computational complexity as popular first-order methods. The paper's primary focus is on the sparse phase retrieval problem, where the goal is to recover a sparse signal from phaseless measurements. The proposed algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge to the ground truth at a quadratic convergence rate after some upper-bounded iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that their algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of achieving a significantly faster convergence rate.

### Strengths
The authors have introduced an efficient second-order algorithm rooted in Newton projection that maintains an equivalent per-iteration computational complexity to widely used first-order methods. The algorithm is accompanied by a theoretical guarantee, ensuring a quadratic convergence rate when converging to the ground truth. Their algorithm's superior performance is substantiated through numerical experiments, demonstrating a notably faster convergence rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Weaknesses
The experimental section could provide a more comprehensive perspective on the algorithm's efficiency by considering different dimensions. For example, it would be beneficial to explore why the experiments were consistently conducted with fixed dimensions, such as signal dimension (n) at 5000 and sample size (m) at 3000. This choice of fixed dimensions raises questions about the scalability of efficiency when the dimension varies.
