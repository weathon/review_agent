# Deceptive-NeRF: Enhancing NeRF Reconstruction using Pseudo-Observations from Diffusion Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
We introduce Deceptive-NeRF, a novel methodology for few-shot NeRF reconstruction, which leverages diffusion models to synthesize plausible pseudo-observations to improve the reconstruction. This approach unfolds through three key steps: 1) reconstructing a coarse NeRF from sparse input data; 2) utilizing the coarse NeRF to render images and subsequently generating pseudo-observations based on them; 3) training a refined NeRF model utilizing input images augmented with pseudo-observations. We develop a rectification latent diffusion model that adeptly transitions RGB images and depth maps from coarse NeRFs into photo-realistic pseudo-observations, all while preserving scene semantics for reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive strategy for training the Deceptive-NeRF, using the current NeRF renderings to create pseudo-observations that enhance the next iteration's NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of synthesizing photo-realistic novel views, even for highly complex scenes with very sparse inputs. Codes will be released.

### Summary
This work introduces a new method, called Deceptive-NeRF,  which leverages diffusion models to synthesize pseudo observations to improve the few-shot NeRF reconstruction. This approach first reconstructs a coarse NeRF from sparse input data, and then utilizes the coarse NeRF to render images and subsequently generates pseudo-observations based on them. Last, a refined NeRF model is trained utilizing input images augmented with pseudo-observations. A deceptive diffusion model is proposed to adeptly convert RGB images and depth maps from coarse NeRFs into photo-realistic pseudo-observations, while preserving scene semantics for reconstruction. Experiments on the synthetic Hypersim dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of synthesizing photo-realistic novel views with very sparse inputs.

### Strengths
This paper introduces an approach for the few-shot novel view synthesis that leverages diffusion models to generate pseudo-observations to provide training signals.

To generate photo-realistic pseudo-observations that faithfully preserve scene semantics and input view consistency, an RGB-D conditioned diffusion model is trained on a synthetic indoor scene dataset (Hypersim).

An ablation study is conducted to verify the design of the method, including progressive training, depth condition, image captioning, and textual inversion.

Results on the Hypersim dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the existing method on the few-shot setting.

### Weaknesses
The idea of introducing pseudo observations to enhance the reconstruction of few-shot Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a promising concept. If the diffusion model can effectively generate pseudo observations that align with the data distribution of a given scene, it has the potential to improve the quality of the refined NeRF reconstructions.

One of the primary concerns is the generalization capacity of the proposed deceptive diffusion model. The real-world scenes' data distribution is often highly intricate and diverse. However, the diffusion model is only trained on a limited dataset consisting of 40 scenes and 2000 synthetic images from the Hypersim dataset during the second stage. As the primary experiment relies on the Hypersim dataset, which shares similarities with the training data, the method's performance on the real LLFF dataset is disappointing. In specific metrics and view-number configurations, it even falls short of the freeNeRF (note that the proposed method also uses the same frequency regularization as in freeNeRF). These outcomes indicate that the proposed approach struggles to generalize to the complexities of real-world scenes.

It would be valuable to include a comparative analysis between the generated pseudo observations and the ground-truth images. This could provide insights into the fidelity of the pseudo observations and their accuracy in replicating the real data.

Information regarding the optimization time required for scene reconstruction is crucial for understanding the method's practicality and efficiency. Including this information in the paper would be helpful for readers seeking to assess the computational demands of implementing this approach.

In Table 1, a more robust baseline for scene reconstruction might be considered, such as the monoSDF method that utilizes monocular depth and normal maps as additional sources of supervision. Comparing the proposed method's performance to such a strong baseline would provide a clearer picture of its relative merits and limitations.

### Questions
- Further discussion on the generalization of the proposed methods.
- It is important to assess the quality of the generated pseudo observations. Detailed evaluations, including visual comparisons with ground-truth data, can help validate the effectiveness of this component in improving the NeRF reconstruction.
- Discussion for the runtime?
- Stronger baseline for scene reconstruction.
 Please refer to weakness for details.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This method proposed a few-shot NeRF training with pseudo samples from the diffusion models as the training corpus, and a series of training strategy that can boost the performance.

### Strengths
The overall idea is reasonable, effective and well elaborated.

### Weaknesses
1. One biggest concern of this idea is that some diffusion-synthesized samples are view-inconsistent. This method proposed a 50% filtering strategy to alleviate this issue, but I don't know whether this issue can be fully bypassed. Introducing confidence score as in NeRF-W may help.
2. Computational cost. Training a diffusion model for 10 days to further finetune a NeRF sounds inefficient to me. Also, can this finetuned CLDM be applied to any in-the-wild NeRF reconstruction dataset?

### Questions
Beside the concerns stated above, I wonder whether you can apply your method to other popular nerf benchmars, such as DTU and LLFF? Also, what is the key limitation of your method and under which setting will this pipeline fails.

### Summary
The present paper proposes a diffusion model training scheme for neural radiance field-based high-quality novel view synthesis from a small number of input views. It's core idea is to train an initial radiance field based on the small number of views, and then generate novel views in this low quality field which are subsequently enhanced using a diffusion model. The resulting higher quality views can then be used to train a higher quality neural radiance field. In terms of technical novelty, most of the substance focuses on training the enhancement diffusion model. Ideally, such training would require the availability of neural fields (both degraded and high quality) for a big number of scenes which is computationally prohibitive. Thus, the authors train the diffusion model to restore a noise corrupted input image (+ depth). The work is shown to outperform other baselines using neural fields.

### Strengths
* This work considers an important problem following the theme of leveraging 2d generative models for 3d. 
* It outperforms its considered baselines for few-shot novel view synthesis

### Weaknesses
* Some of the writing requires improvements, for example in related work the first paragraph ends with the statement that NeRFs require numerous images which is followed by an entire paragraph falsifying that very statement presenting recent advances on few-sample learning with NeRFs. There are also some language issues.
* The evaluation seems insufficient. Given that the diffusion model has been trained on a denoising task to reduce computational burden, it would seem meaningful to evaluate this concept on some existing image restoration networks in comparison to the proposed fine-tuning of a diffusion model.
* the approach seems to be computationally burdensome as its iterative variant requires a sequence of radiance field learning processes.

### Questions
* what is meant by "we use a linearly increasing frequency mask"?
* how is the depth map obtained from the nerf?
* It is surprising to me that the optimization scheme does not result in inconsistency issues. Could the authors provide some intuition for why there is no issue?
* What is meant by "We optimize a shared latent text embedding s [...]"?
