# Generalization error of spectral algorithms

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
The asymptotically precise estimation of the generalization of kernel methods has recently received attention due to the parallels between neural networks and their associated kernels. However, prior works derive such estimates for training by kernel ridge regression (KRR), whereas neural networks are typically trained with gradient descent (GD). In the present work, we consider the training of kernels with a family of \emph{spectral algorithms} specified by profile $h(\lambda)$, and including KRR and GD as special cases. Then, we derive the generalization error as a functional of learning profile $h(\lambda)$ for two data models: high-dimensional Gaussian and low-dimensional translation-invariant model. 
Under power-law assumptions on the spectrum of the kernel and target, we use our framework to (i) give full loss asymptotics for both noisy and noiseless observations (ii) show that the loss localizes on certain spectral scales, giving a new perspective on the KRR saturation phenomenon (iii) conjecture, and demonstrate for the considered data models, the universality of the loss w.r.t. non-spectral details of the problem, but only in case of noisy observation.

### Summary
This paper considers a general framework that expresses the generalization error in spectral algorithms. A generic formula is derived for an arbitrary choice of kernel and profile. Then, the analysis is specialized to account for the circle model and the Wishart model. The theory can explain the KRR saturation phenomenon. Finally, a simplified naive model for noisy observations (NMNO) was proposed, for which the generalization error can be neatly expressed, and it is shown that under certain conditions, the circle model and the Wishart model collapse into NMNO.

### Strengths
* The paper takes a generic point of view. It seems that the result can be applied to many different situations, which improves the power of the result.
* The theory is nicely applied to provide a new perspective to already observed phenomena.
* Overall, the paper is clearly written and most results are motivated.

### Weaknesses
* The analysis in the paper does not account for the errors induced by discretization. For instance, although it is claimed at the beginning of the paper that the theory covers gradient descent, what is really done is for gradient flow. Also, when the kernel $K$ is discretized using the samples, the following assumptions are all made about this discrete kernel, and it is not obvious how it can be connected to the continuous kernel.
* Certain parts of the analysis do not obtain nice closed formulas. For example, those in `section 4` for the Wishart model and those in `section 5` for the noise-free case.
* Although this is a theoretical paper, it would be helpful to include some experiments, even if they are on synthetic datasets. This helps explain (and justify) the theory.

### Questions
* On page 3, when you define $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$, what is the number $P$? Is it the exact rank of $\mathbf{K}$ or its numerical rank, or it does not matter too much?
* In the statement of Proposition 1, I do not think $\rho$ has been defined before and I do not think it is a standard notation outside this community. What is the precise definition of it?
* Can you make your conjecture on page 6 slightly more formal?
* It's not a question, but I think your discussion of the circle model in the GF case might be related to this line of work below. Did you happen to come across these works and see some potentially interesting connections to your paper?

### Summary
This paper defines the spectral algorithms for regression task with Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Gradient Descent (GD) as its special case. Then they derive and compute the generalisation error as a functional of the learning profile $h(\lambda)$ where $\lambda>0$ is the ridge and $h$ a function acting point-wisely on diagonal matrices. 

Then the paper assumes the two data models: high-dimensional Gaussian and low-dimensional translation-invariant model to further derive and interpret the generalisation error, recovering the result from previous study, as well as explaining some phenomenons in a new perspective, for example the saturation effect of KRR.

### Strengths
Originality: The idea of spectral algorithm is novel and can be seen as unifying different common machine learning methods like KRR and GD. 

Quality: The paper contains both theoretical deductions and experimental validations. The citation is also very up-to-date. 

Clarity: The paper is organised in a clear manner by mentioning the motivation at first and postponing the technical details in the appendix.

Significance: Although the computation limit on the two simple models, this paper is a first step into understanding the generalisation error of spectral algorithm in a unifying way.

### Weaknesses
There is almost no weakness except a few typos, for example, on section 4 EXPLICIT FORMS OF THE LOSS FUNCTIONAL (Circle model), on the fourth line it should 
$$
\hat{\lambda}\_k = \sum\_{n=-\infty}^\infty \lambda\_{k+Nn}.
$$

Also, due to the complex form of the generalisation error, only two simple data models are considered.

### Questions
I really like the idea of the generalisation error of spectral algorithm. What are the biggest obstacle to generalise the argument of this paper to more kernels?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper develops optimization algorithms for KRR estimators using a new meta function termed ``spectral profile'', and shows its versatility to generalize to settings beyond KRR.

### Strengths
* Equation (7) in introducing the profile $h(\lambda)$ seems new and interesting.

* The theory appears to be rich, reasonable and self-contained.

### Weaknesses
* The paper may seem a bit hard to follow at the beginning due to certain missing definitions (say, $\nu$ in equation (2)), which need further context derived from reading Section 2.

### Questions
* Is Figure 2 mentioned in the context? I'm kind of missing what those curves represent here.
