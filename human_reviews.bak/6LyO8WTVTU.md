# A Teacher-Guided Framework for Graph Representation Learning

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
We consider the problem of unsupervised representation learning for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
Several state-of-the-art approaches to this problem are based on Contrastive Learning (CL) principles that generate transferable representations. 
Their objective function can be posed as a supervised discriminative task using 'hard labels', as they consider each pair of graphs as either 'equally positive' or 'equally negative'.
However, it has been observed that using 'soft labels' in a Bayesian way can reduce the variance of the risk for discriminative tasks in supervised settings. 
Motivated by this, we propose a CL framework for GNNs, called *Teacher-guided Graph Contrastive Learning (TGCL)*, that incorporates `soft labels' to facilitate a more regularized discrimination. 
In particular, we propose a teacher-student framework where the student network learns the representation by distilling the representations produced by the teacher network trained using unlabelled graphs. 
Our proposed approach can be adapted to any existing CL methods and empirically improves the performance across diverse downstream tasks.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a contrastive learning method for graph representation learning, where a self-supervised pre-trained teacher model is used to guide the training of a student model to obtain more generalized representations. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of graph classification and link prediction tasks.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using teacher-student architecture in graph representation learning is interesting;

2. The authors designed several loss functions to make use of the soft labels learned from the teacher model;

3. The authors did comprehensive experiments on link prediction and classification tasks;

4. This paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The major concern is the technical soundness of the teacher-student architecture. Intuitively, if you have a perfect teacher model, you can use it directly to calculate graph embeddings. Is it necessary to design such complicated contrastive learning losses to distill from the teacher model? The teacher-student model is originally designed to distill knowledge from large models and inject into small models, however, in this paper, the purpose of teacher-student is not to reduce the model size.

2. The performance of the student model is theoretically bounded by the teacher model. I'm curious why the propose model TGCL-DSLA can perform better than the teacher DSLA and GraphLoG?

3. For graph classification task, the datasets are all on molecule properties, which is quite limited. It is better to add more types of graph classification tasks to see how the proposed model performs on various type of graphs.

4. From Table 1, most experimental results do not show significant improvement over baselines.

4. According to Figure 4, why the proposed TGCL-DSLA learns the best graph embedding? It is hard to see the difference between (a) and (c).

### Summary
This paper proposed a contrastive learning (CL) based knowledge distillation (KD) framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).  Particularly, the authors incorporated `soft labels` to facilitate a more regularized discrimination. In the teacher-student KD framework, the student network learns the representation by distilling the representations produced by the teacher network trained using unlabelled graphs.

### Strengths
1. The overall written is clear and easy to follow.
2. The experiments show that the distilled results perform better than the original teachers.

### Weaknesses
I'm not the expert in contrastive learning. But as far as I know, the soft labeled CL is not novel. For example, "Soft-Labeled Contrastive Pre-training for Function-level Code Representation" in EMNLP 2022 has already proposed to leverage soft labels to mitigate similar issues of hard labels, .e.g, semantic problem, false negative case. I'm not sure whether other related works also applied the similar soft labeled CL framework.

### Questions
In the experiments, the student model can consistently outperform the teacher model via the distillation. What if you use the current student model as the next round teacher model, can your performance continue to increase? or how many rounds KD will make the improvement negligible?

### Summary
**Summary**

The paper proposed an distillation-based unsupervised representation learning method. Given a teacher model pretrained on an unlabel dataset, a student model is pretrained on the same pretrained dataset with the TGCL objective, and then further finetuned on the downstream datasets. 

**Contributions**
 1. The authors modified existing contrastive learning objectives (e.g. NTXent, D-SLA) using the distilled perceptual distance. 
 - In NTXent, they reweight the cosine similarity with the proposed distilled perceptual distance. 
 - In D-SLA, they replace the graph edit distance with the proposed distilled perceptual distance

 2. This approach is implemented and evaluated on various node and graph classification datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is well-organized and well-written. The motivation and methodology is clearly stated. 
Addressing my concerns would be greatly appreciated, and it could lead to an increase in my rating.

### Weaknesses
**Concern 1. Why can the student model trained by TGCL outperform the teacher model on the downstream tasks?**

TGCL primarily relies on the semantic similarity (soft label) provided by the teacher model in a knowledge distillation manner. In general distillation settings (e.g. model compression via distillation), the performance (or generalization capacity) of the student model is usually upper bounded by the teacher model. 

Thus, I wonder why TGCL-student outperforms the teacher model? Which part of the algorithm contributes to the performance / information gain over the teacher model? 



**Concern 2. Is TGCL sensitive to the pretraining method of the teacher model?**

As shown in Table 1, TGCL-analogues do not consistently reach the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Does TGCL exclusively apply to teacher models trained using specific pretraining methods, such as GraphLog and D-SLA?

If TGCL can enhance teacher models trained by any algorithm, could it serve as an iterative evolutionary paradigm? For instance, a teacher model undergoes k epochs of pretraining, followed by k epochs of TGCL updates, and this process repeats until convergence.



**Concern 3: Does TGCL's performance depend on the quality of the teacher model?**

As TGCL heavily relies on the semantic similarity of teacher embeddings, I wonder to what extent the performance of TGCL relies on the representation quality of the teacher model

Intuitively, obtaining a proficient teacher model is as challenging as achieving high-quality unsupervised representations. If TGCL only works with a well-trained teacher models, it may not address unsupervised representation learning directly. Instead,  it serves as an incremental improvement to existing effective unsupervised pretraining methods.



**Concern 4: Does TGCL work when the teacher model overfits to the pretraining domain?**

If the teacher model fits the pretraining dataset well (or, ‘overfits the pretraining distribution’), it may encode domain-specific biases that hinder out-of-domain generalization. In this scenario, does it harm the downstream performance of the student model? What aspect of TGCL can help mitigate pretraining bias and enhance downstream generalization?
