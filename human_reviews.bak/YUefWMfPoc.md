# How to fix a broken confidence estimator: Evaluating post-hoc methods for selective classification with deep neural networks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
This paper addresses the problem of selective classification for deep neural networks, where a model is allowed to abstain from low-confidence predictions to avoid potential errors. We focus on so-called post-hoc methods, which replace the confidence estimator of a given classifier without retraining or modifying it, thus being practically appealing. Considering neural networks with softmax outputs, our goal is to identify the best confidence estimator that can be computed directly from the unnormalized logits. This problem is motivated by the intriguing observation in recent work that many classifiers appear to have a ``broken'' confidence estimator, in the sense that their selective classification performance is much worse than what could be expected by their corresponding accuracies. We perform an extensive experimental study of many existing and proposed confidence estimators applied to 84 pretrained ImageNet classifiers available from popular repositories. Our results show that a simple $p$-norm normalization of the logits, followed by taking the maximum logit as the confidence estimator, can lead to considerable gains in selective classification performance, completely fixing the pathological behavior observed in many classifiers. As a consequence, the selective classification performance of any classifier becomes almost entirely determined by its corresponding accuracy. Moreover, these results are shown to be consistent under distribution shift. We also investigate why certain classifiers innately have a good confidence estimator that apparently cannot be improved by post-hoc methods.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of how to improve selective classification (i.e. predicting only on some subset of the data so as to minimize mistakes) via post-hoc modifications to the confidence predictions of trained models (i.e. modifying the logits/softmax outputs). The main contributions of this work are a detailed comparison of different post-hoc methods applied to various model confidence estimation procedures, along with a new metric for performing this comparison (normalized AURC).

### Strengths
- **Originality:** Although I am not fully familiar with the line of work on selective classification, the idea of NAURC is a nice (and to me, new) extension of AURC that allows comparison across tasks as the authors mention. On the post-training calibration side, the main new idea is logit $p$-normalization with tunable $p$ and scaling, as a sort of simple version of input-dependent temperature scaling, and this also seems new to me.
- **Quality:** The quality of the work is good; the problem is well-motivated, the considered confidence estimators for models are comprehensive, and the evaluation is done well.
- **Clarity:** Overall the paper is easy to follow and organized well.
- **Significance:** While the actual novelty of the $p$-norm confidence tuning seems low given prior work, I believe the empirical results - particularly the data efficiency of this approach - seems to be non-trivially useful/significant. Additionally, the empirical comparison done in this work will certainly be useful for those interested in applying post-training methods to selective classification.

### Weaknesses
## Main Weaknesses
1. **Insufficient comparison to post-training methods.** My main concern with the evaluation in this work is that the only two confidence tuning approaches considered are standard temperature scaling (TS) and $p$-norm tuning, and the conclusion is that $p$-norm tuning can be better for the tasks considered. However, there are several similarly simple (in terms of parameters) approaches introduced in [1], which the authors themselves reference when proposing $p$-norm tuning, which are not compared to in the main results of the paper. As a result, it is difficult to determine how much of a benefit there really is from the proposed $p$-norm tuning.
2. **Discussion of related work on calibration.** While the authors do a good job of discussing prior work on selective classification, there is very little discussion of work on post-training calibration methods. Namely, I think the work would benefit from discussion of modifications to TS/related strategies with more justification for why comparing $p$-norm normalization with vanilla TS is sufficient for making their points.

## Minor Comments
- Typo on page 8 s/"Logits Marging"/"Logits Margin"
- Table 7 in the Appendix (with the comprehensive results) could be presented better.

## Recommendation
While I have some reservations about the novelty of the methods in the work, I think there are several useful ideas (NAURC) and insights in the paper. Particularly, I find the data-efficiency observations to be of note (as discussed in Appendix E and at the top of page 8 of the main paper), and would have liked to see more related discussion in the main paper - this seems to be a very useful attribute and good point of comparison. As a result, I lean accept for this paper and recommend **weak accept**.

### Questions
- In Section 3.2.2, the authors write: "a useful property of MSP-TS (but not MSP-TS-NLL) is that it can never have worse performance than the MSP baseline"; I do not see why this is true. As long as we do TS on held-out calibration/validation data, it is certainly still possible that any metric could be worse on test data, unless I'm misunderstanding what the authors mean by MSP-TS here.
- What is the best choice of $p$ found by tuning $p$-norm? It would be useful to include this in the main discussion, and whether there is actually some significant benefit to tuning $p$ instead of just using $p = 2$.
- In Table 3, it would be useful to include error bounds (like 1 std range) since you are reporting averages across all models here to better get a sense of the improvement.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of learning selective classification. In particular, it explores possibilities in designing better confidence estimators. In experiments, this paper considers multiple known confidence estimators along with multiple logit transformations. Also, for unified comparison, this paper proposes a new metric, called normalized area under risk coverage (NAURC). Based on this new metric, a simple p-norm normalization of the logits along with the standard maximum logit  as a confidence estimator leads to considerable gain in selective classification performance.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a new evaluation metric, i.e., NAURC, and provides a new finding (i.e., a simple p-norm normalization of the logits along with the standard maximum logit  as a confidence estimator is good for selective classification) from extensive empirical evaluation.

### Weaknesses
This paper explores an interesting issue on recovering “broken” confidence estimators, which is tightly related to a popular calibration problem, though I found that the conclusion of this paper is unclear. 

1. The main corner is that the connection of the conclusion of this paper to the guaranteed risk control (i.e, (2) in Geifman & El-Yaniv (2017)) is unclear. NAURC can be a good intermediate metric, but this confidence estimator should be used along with a selective classifier. Then, the confidence estimator with a good NAURC should demonstrate its benefits along with a selective classifier (in terms of achieving a desired risk level) for in-distribution and out-of-distribution experiments. 
2. I’m not quite motivated from Figure 1. What’s the reason that the left figure is bad? In terms of smoothness, yes it looks bad, but in constructing a guaranteed selective classifier, can it be the problem? Probably, adding some context would be useful in motivating readers.

### Questions
1. What’s the benefits of conclusion of this paper in terms of the performance of the final guaranteed risk controlled selective classifier by  Geifman & El-Yaniv (2017)?
2. What’s the reason that the left figure is bad in terms of constructing a guaranteed selective classifier?

### Summary
In this study, the authors present a confidence estimator for selective classification, aiming to optimize prediction accuracy by effectively filtering out uncertain samples (i.e. more likely to be misclassified). The proposed method includes 1) temperature scaling with AURC as the optimization objective, 2) logit normalization with learnable p (p from p-norm) and temperature t, 3) a normalized AURC as the evaluation metric which is monotonically related to AURC but avoids AURC's drawback of arbitrary value, 4) MSP fallback: check whether the estimator provides an improvement to the MSP baseline and, if not, then use the MSP instead. Compared to existing logit-adjusting strategies, the authors identify MaxLogit-pNorm as the clear winner in terms of NAURC.

### Strengths
Originality: The authors propose 1) a learnable version of logit normalization for selective classification; 2) a new metric normalized AURC to avoid the arbitrary value issue of AURC. 

Clarity: In general, the paper is easy to understand.

Significance: 1) The method itself is simple and effective. 2) This study provides valuable insights into its application in selective classification, e.g., it shows that MaxLogit-pNorm has superior performance and also studies what kind of methods are more likely to benefit from logit normalization and what cannot.

### Weaknesses
Originality: The paper makes an incremental contribution to the field by extending the logit normalization to selective classification, initially introduced in "Mitigating Neural Network Overconfidence with Logit Normalization." The current study diverges from the previous work by two aspects: 1) The employed norm's 'p' is tunable and does not default to using the L2-norm. Instead, it utilizes a validation set to select the appropriate type of norm. However, the benefits of this process are challenging to quantify, and it's unclear how impactful they may be. The authors have not conducted a corresponding ablation study to demonstrate that the chosen norm is indeed superior to a p optimized through selection. 2) The referenced paper introduces logit normalization during training-time, whereas this study applies it as a post-hoc measure. The amount of novelty this aspect brings is somewhat limited.  

Quality: There's inconsistency in the performance metrics used in the experiments, with initial methods based on NAURC and subsequent ones relying on SAC, without offering a comparative analysis across all metrics in the appendix. This lack of uniformity casts doubt on the results' consistency and the experiment's overall reliability.

Clarity: The paper could be significantly improved by providing more intuition/motivation and explaining the rationale behind methodological choices. For instance, the reasons why p-norm would perform effectively in selective classification are not well-articulated. The paper references Wei et al. (2022) but does not provide adequate context for readers less familiar with this work, compromising the clarity of the research. 

Significance: The research's significance is limited, as it doesn't introduce considerable challenges beyond what is already known from the application of logit normalization to selective classification. Furthermore, intriguing findings, like those depicted in Figure 11, are not sufficiently highlighted or explained in the main text, representing a missed opportunity to underscore potential novel insights. The reasons behind the inability of high-confidence models to enhance selective classification remain unexplored, leaving gaps in understanding.

### Questions
1) What is the intuition behind using p-normalization? Why is logit information helpful in distinguishing between correctly classified and incorrectly classified samples?
2) For figure 10:  “models that produce highly confident MSPs tend to have better confidence estimators (in terms of NAURC), while models whose MSP distribution is more balanced tend to be easily improvable by post-hoc optimization—which, in turn, makes the resulting confidence estimator concentrated on highly confident values.” In instances where logit normalization proves ineffective, could the issue stem from the original model being under-calibrated, blurring the distinction between correctly and incorrectly classified samples due to a minimal confidence gap? My guess of why the logit normalization works is that: it is actually making the correct sample have much higher confidence while incorrect samples have slightly lower confidence, and therefore the confidence can distinguish them well. If this is the case, would it be possible to consider the corresponding ECE (compared to the histogram) to see if under-confident models are more easily improved, while over-confident models are not?  Based on my observation, many models in timm are actually under-confident due to insufficient training.  
3) Why is learnable p-norm better than L2-norm? Why is a different norm required for different datasets? How significant is the benefit of this learnability? I think an ablation study can be better to support the use of learnable p.
4) What loss objective was used in the training of 'p' and 't'? Was it AURC or normalized AURC?
5) How was MSP FALLBACK considered in the experiments? Was it only taken into account when calculating the evaluation metric "average positive gain"? For a dataset, what criteria should we use to decide whether to use MSP or logit normalization? Should we still rely on its performance on the validation set, or is there a separate held-out set for deciding whether to use MSP Fallback?
6)  Is the third graph in Figure 3 also at 0.3491? It seems to have a high correlation.
7) Can you provide a more detailed explanation of Figure 3? What kind of message can we read from different optimal values of 'p'? Are models with different 'p' but the same architecture shown in the same plot?
8) In Sec 4.3, it states: "This robustness can be explained by a strong correlation between the selective performance in the original test set and under distribution shift." Could you elaborate on what this sentence means?
9) If time permits, it would be better to include a result for NAURC in Table 4 for consistent comparison.

### Summary
The paper considers the selective classification setup using a set of established post-hoc SC techniques. To improve performance, an additional optimization process deliberately optimizes SC method hyper-parameters based on a validation set. A new metric is proposed which fixes previous methods' sensitivity to the underlying classifier's risk. The post-hoc optimization process improves confidence estimation performance across a wide range of models. The paper also discusses selective classification performance under distribution shift, showing that SC performance degrades under stronger shifts and that better in-distribution performance correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses a timely and important topic in uncertainty quantification and trustworthy machine learning.
- The background section is very well written and easy to follow.
- The newly proposed normalized AURC metric seems to be an appropriate fix for accuracy sensitivity of the previously introduced metrics. It is important to properly evaluate selective classifiers and compare them meaningfully against each other. 
- The post-hoc fix for confidence estimators seems promising.
- A lot of additional experiments and background is presented in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
- As per my understanding, the paper proposes to optimize hyper-parameters of selective classification methods based on a hold-out dataset. This process is never formally defined in the paper. Moreover, the paper does not consider potential (negative) side effects of this optimization procedure. Especially under distribution shift, deliberate calibration towards an in-distribution validation dataset might be more harmful than simply performing selective classification with a pre-defined threshold.
- Neither temperature scaling nor logit normalization are new concepts but have been shown in past work to help reduce overconfidence and to improve calibration. Therefore, the paper does not provide novelty in terms of new selective classification approaches.
- It is unclear to me what the take-away message from Tables 1 and 2 are. Based on these results, it is unclear when we expect pNorm to work and whether architecture (and if so, which exact part of it) do prevent us from improving performance with pNorm.
- Section 4.2 suggests that the described post-hoc SC methods can fix "broken" confidence estimators. As per my understanding, NAURC was introduced to remove the E-AURC's accuracy sensitivity. If the proposed post-hoc fix works, would that not remove the the need for the NAURC score as accuracy now determines SC performance (i.e., accuracy and calibration are correlated)?
- Section 4.3 which talks about performance under distribution shift. It appears like the finding that better in-distribution classification performance leads to out-of-distribution performance is also not new and discussed in [1]. Although the paper does provide the exact numbers of how strongly performance degrades, the take-away message beyond the effect already introduced in [1] appears limited.
