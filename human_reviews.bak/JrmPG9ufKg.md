- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
We investigate contrastive learning in the federated setting through the lens of Sim- CLR and multi-view mutual information maximization. In doing so, we uncover a connection between contrastive representation learning and user verification; by adding a user verification loss to each client’s local SimCLR loss we recover a lower bound to the global multi-view mutual information. To accommodate for the case of when some labelled data are available at the clients, we extend our SimCLR variant to the federated semi-supervised setting. We see that a supervised SimCLR objective can be obtained with two changes: a) the contrastive loss is computed between datapoints that share the same label and b) we require an additional auxiliary head that predicts the correct labels from either of the two views. Along with the proposed SimCLR extensions, we also study how different sources of non-i.i.d.-ness can impact the performance of federated unsupervised learning through global mutual information maximization; we find that a global objective is beneficial for some sources of non-i.i.d.-ness but can be detrimental for others. We empirically evaluate our proposed extensions in various tasks to validate our claims and furthermore demonstrate that our proposed modifications generalize to other pretraining methods.

### Summary
The paper presents an extension of SimCLR, a contrastive learning framework, to the federated learning (FL) setting, with a focus on mutual information maximization (MI) across multiple views.
The authors establish a connection between contrastive representation learning and user verification and propose a method that incorporates a user verification loss into each client’s local SimCLR loss, resulting in a lower bound to the global multi-view mutual information. 
Additionally, the paper extends the approach to the federated semi-supervised setting, introducing modifications to accommodate labelled data at the clients and proposing an auxiliary head for label prediction. The paper also investigates the impact of different sources of non-i.i.d. data distribution on federated unsupervised learning performance.

### Strengths
The extension of SimCLR to the federated setting and the exploration of MI maximization in this context is particularly given the increasing interest in FL.
The paper provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed methods, including the connection between contrastive learning and user verification, and the derivation of a lower bound to the global multi-view MI.
The authors conduct both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments, providing a thorough evaluation of their proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical derivations, propositions, and lemmas mainly connect to and extend existing methods, which might be perceived as a lack of novelty. For example, the idea of decomposed MI in (1) and (2) has been presented in Sordoni et al. (2021). The proofs of propositions and lemmas are quite standard which mostly follow the existing approaches in literature. It would be more beneficial if the authors can clarify the unique aspects and advantages of their approach, and clearly differentiate it from existing methods.
Furthermore, the authors only provide analysis for a two-view setting, which might not be completely satisfied with the proposed multi-view MI.
The paper does not present algorithms for federated training, which is crucial for practical implementation. Moreover, as a federated learning algorithm, there should be a thorough analysis of the convergence guarantees, which seems to be lacking.
The experimental setup presented in the paper demonstrates a certain degree of comprehensiveness; however, it appears to be somewhat limited in terms of diversity. The FL baselines utilized in the study are mainly adaptations from centralized methods, which may not fully represent the state-of-the-art in unsupervised representation learning within the FL context. 
Looking at the results outlined in Tables 1 and 2, it becomes evident that in a majority of the scenarios, the performance of the proposed method is either on par with or falls short of other unsupervised baselines. This observation raises questions about the clear and tangible benefits of the proposed approach.

### Questions
Additionally, the proposed multi-view MI estimation might result in additional computation overhead.  This is particularly crucial in FL where computational resources are may be limited. Therefore, the paper could be significantly enhanced by a more thorough analysis and discussion of the trade-offs between performance and computational complexity.

### Summary
The paper presents a federated variant of SimCLR for unsupervised representation learning. It motivates its approach by a mutual information argument: since in standard SimCLR the goal is to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the two generated views, this MI can be decomposed into a local variant that corresponds to local SimCLR and two excess terms that need to be bounded. The first relates the mutual information between the first view and its local client, which is lower bounded using a classifier that seeks to predict the client ID from the first view. The second term relates to the additional or excess mutual information of the second view on the client which can be upper bounded by a second classifier that predicts the client ID from the second view. In addition, the paper presents a semi-supervised variant of this approach.

### Strengths
- unsupervised federated representation learning is an important and interesting use-case
- the method theoretically motivated and sound

### Weaknesses
- some baselines for semi-supervised learning, and some proper supervised baselines are missing.
- The empirical results show that the proposed federated SimCLR variant is only en par with spectral constrastive learning when using a user verification loss. This is not properly discussed.

### Questions
**Question:**
- How does the semi-supervised variant of SimCLR relate to pseudo-labeling approaches, such as distributed distillation [2] and federated co-training [1]?

**Detailed Comments:**

- Please discuss the empirical results, in particular the fact that FedSimCLR is not outperforming the baselines, in more detail. The proposed method does not have to outperform the baselines, as long as the benefits and limitations of it in comparison with existing methods are properly discussed. To stress this point: it has become usual to require papers to have large tables where the proposed method has "the best number" in each row, but this just promotes scientifically questionable practices to improve the numbers. I am happy that this paper presents more interesting results, but they require, unfortunately, a more thorough discussion. One could even, for example, use mutual information as quality measure (where one would probably rely on the more tractable Wasserstein dependency measure [6], isntead of approximating MI).
- Please state what exactly the supervised baseline in your experiments is (I assume FedAvg). Please compare to (one of the) FL variants for non-iid data, such as FedProx [4], FedBN [5], and SCAFFOLD [3], as baselines.
- For the semi-supervised setting, please compare to pseudo-labeling approaches [1,2] as semi-supervised baselines.

### Summary
This work extends SimCLR for federated learning, emphasizing multi-view mutual information maximization. It connects contrastive representation learning with user verification and introduces a user verification loss to improve global multi-view mutual information. Additionally, the study extends SimCLR to the federated semi-supervised setting, achieving a supervised SimCLR objective with specific modifications. The research explores the impact of non-i.i.d. data on federated unsupervised learning and shows that the global objective has mixed effects depending on the source of non-i.i.d. data.

### Strengths
- The problem of pretraining large models in a federated setting is quite important and has seen little progress so far.
- The proposed LB on the global multi-view objective is principled and as the authors show amenable to federated training. 
- Experiments in the semi-supervised setting are a nice addition to the paper, and clearly shows that their objective can be built upon.

### Weaknesses
- The paper lacks convergence analysis of their optimization algorithm, which is quite common in FL papers. 
- Experiments on more challenging/heterogeneous benchmarks like ImageNet are missing. 
- Discussion on how their objective can be adapted to other centralized pretraining objectives is missing. (See questions)
- (Minor/Nit) Proposition 2 need not be stated, it follows immediately from previous Lemmas.

### Questions
- How does the proposed MI LB/relaxation work if we move slightly away from SimCLR and look at related objectives: InfoNCE, or even non-contrastive ones like Barlow Twins? Are federated versions of these similar to Federated SimCLR?
