# Vision-based Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics for 3D Moving Target

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 5

## Abstract
Data-driven discovery of governing equations has kindled significant interests in many science and engineering areas. Existing studies primarily focus on uncovering equations that govern nonlinear dynamics based on direct measurement of the system states (e.g., trajectories). Limited efforts have been placed on distilling governing laws of dynamics directly from videos for moving targets in a 3D space. To this end, we propose a vision-based approach to automatically uncover governing equations of nonlinear dynamics for 3D moving targets via raw videos recorded by a set of cameras. The approach is composed of three key blocks: (1) a target tracking module that extracts plane pixel motions of the moving target in each video, (2) a Rodrigues' rotation formula-based coordinate transformation learning module that reconstructs the 3D coordinates with respect to a predefined reference point, and (3) a spline-enhanced library-based sparse regressor that uncovers the underlying governing law of dynamics. This framework is capable of effectively handling the challenges associated with measurement data, e.g., noise in the video, imprecise tracking of the target that causes data missing, etc. The efficacy of the proposed method has been demonstrated through multiple sets of synthetic videos considering different nonlinear dynamics.

### Summary
This paper proposed a method to automatically determine the governing equations of nonlinear dynamics for 3D moving targets via raw videos recorded by a set of cameras.
A set of synthetically generated videos is used to test the performance of the proposed technique.

### Strengths
General equations on the 3D motion dynamics are determined from video data of moving objects.

### Weaknesses
Only results from synthetic data are provided. Even though some test results with additive noise are presented, they cannot replace experiments with real data, where additional factors such as changes in illumination and localization errors may take place. These are crucial to determine the applicability of the proposed methodology to videos captured from the real world.
The good theoretical analysis of the geometrical issues invloved in the proposed model, need to be assessed with real data.

### Questions
Why didn't you extend the experiments with captured video data?

### Summary
The paper presented an approach for estimating the dynamics of a system using collected data from some observed solution. A system of three cameras was discussed for 3D point cloud estimation and object tracking for the purpose of collecting data about a system. Subsequently, the dynamics is estimated by fitting piece-wise polynomials to the time-series data. Method is evaluated using several synthetic datasets.

### Strengths
- The general problem was clearly discussed. 
- Apart from some sections, generally, was easy to follow and understand the setup of the research questions.

### Weaknesses
- Relatively poor organization:
    - For example, some of the vital information are introduced early on, in Figure 1, and only referred and discussed in section 3.3. One has to referee to the formula in the figure to follow the discussion, although it was brief.
- Insufficient experimental results: 
    - One of the main claimed contributions of the paper is the estimation of dynamics from data, collected using multiple cameras. None of the experimental results include such dataset. Infact all of the datasets were generated using a solution for some known dynamical systems. Please look at the questions section for more details.
- Contribution:
    - Contribution of the paper is not clear. Although it was stated to be the integration of different modules for tackling measurement noise and data gap, those points were not sufficiently argued for or validated with experimental results.

### Questions
- Data collection: The importance of Section 3.1. is not clear.
    - The relative camera positions are already assumed (section 3.3), however, it is stated that only one camera is calibrated (presumably known intrinsic camera parameter). Why is this assumption made?  is there any problem domain that forces this kind of assumption?
    - Why not use off the shelf 3D reconstruction (scene reconstruction) algorithms for the data collection together with scene-flow? 
    
- More questions/suggestions:
    - Since the primarily claimed contribution of the work is using multi-camera systems for data collection, I suggest to work with real-world problems where different advantages and disadvantages of multi-camera-based data collection can be explored.
    - I understand, the common approach is to sample a particular solution and discover the dynamics from the data. In most cases, however, it seems the choice of test systems are chaotic which are exceptionally sensitive to initial condition/parameters. How robust are these discovery systems? since the data are samples from some solution which can be wildly different depending on the initial conditions.

### Summary
The paper describes an approach to discover the equations governign the non-linear dynamics of a moving target and claims one of the first approach to do it on collection of 2D videos. Synchronised cameras proposed used to capture object motion and track it in 3D. A spline model aims to denoise the object motion and fit this to sparse coefficients to some fixed candidate functions given in a library.

### Strengths
The paper boast of proposing first approach to discover the equations of dynamics for moving target while using the 2D data. The presented results demonstrate superior performance of the approach when compared to the baseline. While the paper lacks crucial information and is technically dense, it is generally well written.

### Weaknesses
- The paper rely to a great extent on figure 1 but the proposed methodology has not been explained well either in the figure or in the text. A lot of focus has been given to finding out the noisy 3D tracks from calibrated camera rigs - where I don't see any novelty. Vet little any attention has been given to actual spline driven fitting of reconstructed track and learning the equation parameters. I find that many of the notations in figure 1 still remain undescribed and the paper jumps from writing about YoLo V8 (perhaps for object detection), "learning" 3D trajectory (which looks like reconstructing 3D from 2D detections) to equation fitting which is regression. Are these three different stages of proposed pipeline of everything is learned end to end? 

- The paper boasts heavily of being the first one to find these dynamics from images. All presented results however are on synthetic data and does not really justify an expansive 3 camera setup to track and 3D reconstruct the object locations. Authors did not explain well what the type of objects one might want to track, and the challenges associated with the same. Tracking square and star projections using three cameras and YoLo8 seems an overkill and even if one can do so what is novel in doing so?
I think the paper could do with devoting more time in explaining why the discovery of dynamics is important and how the proposed setup helps in tracking the real objects better for the same. I understand the challenges in getting the real data for the problem at hand but think it is extremely important to present with some real results - even qualitative results with 2D/3D tracking could work leaving the equation discovery out of evaluation.

### Questions
- looking at table S2, it seems that the problem of equation discovery seems to be an ill posed problem and require a very densely sampled set of observations. Can author comment on the terms used in the library and the interdependency in those terms to model a sparse set of trajectories? 

- Shouldn't you also present the trajectory noise as an independent measure of good 3D tracking to isolate errors in 3D tracking and equation discovery?
