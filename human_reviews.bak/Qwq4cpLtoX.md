## Abstract
What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training.

### Summary
The paper studies the existence of the ability of performing In-Context Learning (ICL) among different architectural choices like Transformers, State Space Models, RNNs and CNNs across different kinds of tasks. Typically in the regime of large language models, primarily transformer based models have been scaled up and shown to shine in ICL, but the authors show that other architectures are also capable of performing ICL, and some even better than transformers in the settings considered. To fairly test for ICL, authors train all the models from scratch, following the setup of Garg et. al (2023) where training is done on a suite of different supervised learning setups. The authors provide a clear answer that most of the architectures are capable of performing ICL and this phenomena is not specific to transformer based models, and also provide an interesting revelation of state-space models performing better ICL capabilities, which would be quite useful as such models do not incur the same computational costs as transformers.

### Strengths
- The work explores diverse choices over tasks as well as architecture setups, and successfully answers the question posed which is to study if each of the architectures possess some ICL capability.

- The findings highlight an interesting result which is the superior performance of state-space based models like HYENA when compared to attention-based models, which provides clear validation of the need to scale such state-space models on real-world data like language.

- The release of code for this work would be very useful for the community to further study, analyze and understand ICL capabilities on different tasks, and when should one approach be considered over the other.

### Weaknesses
While the authors have done a fantastic job on studying different tasks and model architectures, I found some of the core components lacking. For example, details about how the context input is encoded and provided to the models is missing, as well as an explanation and hypothesis of why certain transformer based models do better than the others, and what the differences are. I have listed some of my specific concerns below, and would be happy to raise my score if they are addressed.

- Since the macro perspective is only studied in the language modeling domain, it would make more sense to move the write-up around it under the Language Modeling section.
- It would be nice if the authors could provide a write-up on the differences between the various transformer-based and state-space based models for completeness. In particular, why does one model based on transformers (eg. LLAMA2) give better ICL performance than the other (eg. T5).
- How does this contrast to the already present information that Transformers can do ICL considerably well? The experiments in Table 2 seem to show that attention-based models are fairly poor at ICL but Garg et. al (2023) and Muller et. al (2022) show that they do quite well.
- Details about how data is processed for image classification is missing. Do the experiments use embeddings obtained from ResNet on images to get a set of vectors and labels as context, or are the models given raw pixel information in some way?
- While Figure 1 is interesting in showing different models undergo learning in different ways, is there any commonality here? For example, do these trends hold over all kinds of tasks considered?
- A lot of the performance of transformer-based models depends on how the data is represented in the context. Providing additional implementation details about how data is represented for each experiment as well as how training is done would be helpful.
- There is also a lot of interesting ablations in the appendix of the paper on different kinds of transformers (eg. Decoder only vs Encoder-Decoder). Insights about differences between such models is more fundamental than differences between small architectural changes between different named architectures, and thus a detailed comment on them in the main section would be nice.
- The authors should consider citing the following works which are directly related to ICL.

### Questions
- *Thus, each train and test example is a unique learning problem, but of a consistent type (e.g. linear regression)* : In this particular setup, “consistent type” does not imply linear regression but just regression in general. Would that be correct?
- The difference between "bursty" and "non-bursty" prompts was not clear, at least to me, from the write-up. Could the authors clarify this distinction?
- For Transformer based experiments (eg. BERT, GPT2, etc.), are positional encodings used? This is primarily because observations seen in linear regression, for eg., are exchangeable and thus observation i and j should not be treated differently (i.e. there should be permutation invariance in the predictive distribution).
- For the transformer models, can the authors clarify what an encoder-only transformer model is?
- It is not clear why the ``ICL Score” is a good metric to care about. Could the authors explain what is the relevance of this score, and why is it important other than validation loss?

### Summary
This paper conducts large-scale experiments to investigate the ability of different network architectures (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models) to conduct in-context learning. This paper evaluates fifteen architectures on five synthetic in-context learning tasks, and demonstrate that all considered architectures can conduct in-context learning in some cases. In addition, this paper discusses how the causal masking in transformers and the training dynamics of different models influence the in-context learning ability.

### Strengths
1.	The paper conducts extensive experiments and provide full details of the training protocols and hyperparameters.
2.	Most part of the paper is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
1.	My main concern is that the paper lacks the discussion of under which conditions a certain architecture tends to succeed in in-context learning and under which conditions it fails. In other words, I think the current main claim of this paper that “all considered architectures can perform in-context learning under certain conditions” is not very interesting and surprising. Instead, presenting both the success and failure cases and carefully comparing the settings/conditions for failure cases to occur may provide more insights to the community. I do not expect the paper to find the essential reasons for a certain architecture to fail in in-context learning, but more ablation studies on various training settings/hyperparameters are encouraged and at least some reasonable hypotheses can be made to explain the failure cases. The authors have some discussions on the unexpected low performance of BERT and T5, which I greatly appreciate. However, this is not enough, and I hope to see a more comprehensive picture of how various factors affect the in-context learning ability.
2.	When introducing the image classification task on Page 4, the definition of “bursty” and “non-bursty” samples are unclear and not self-contained. I feel confused without referring to the original paper. I encourage the authors to give a toy example in a figure along with the description.

### Questions
1.	What is the difference between the micro perspective of in-context learning and the macro perspective of in-context learning? On Page 4, the paper says “While the micro perspective focuses on specific tasks, the macro perspective offers a broader view of in-context learning by focusing on loss”, but I’m not able to capture the essential difference of the macro perspective from the micro perspective from this sentence.
2.	In the task of Associative Recall, I’m concerned with the following case. If the query token never appears in the prompt sequence, how can the network be able to predict the corresponding target of this query token? For example, if the prompt is “a,1,b,3,c,2,d”, how can the network predict the target for the token “d” when the network has never seen “d” in the prompt?
3.	For CNNs, why do the authors use lightweight convolutions and dynamics convolutions for experiments? Why not consider traditional convolutions, which are more widely used and studied? The authors are encouraged to clarify the reason for this specific setting.
4.	What is the criterion to assign the cells red/green colors in Table 2?

### Summary
The paper is an empirical study investigating the ability to perform in-context learning of different architectures. It carries out the study with tasks in the form of few-shot learning: a prompt with a few input-output pairs and a final input query; the model outputs the prediction of the query. There are 5 tasks proposed: associative recall, linear regression, multiclass classification, image classification and language modeling, where the first 3 tasks use synthetic data. A wide range of model architectures are studies, including RNN, Convolutional networks, transformers and state space models. The conclusion is that all architectures exhibit in-context learning capabilities when tuned appropriately.

### Strengths
The paper presents a study that includes a wide range of architectures and tasks. The implementation looks reproducible and results seem to be credible to me.

### Weaknesses
Is the conclusion of the paper trivial? The few-shot learning task still can be seen as having a mapping between input and output, albeit the input are more complicated in this case. So I would expect that any universal approximator should at least have the capability to perform such a task. Of course, the performance would vary because of characteristics of the architecture and tuning. But the authors don't seem to put emphasis on the relative performance of the different architectures in their study.

### Questions
1. It sounds like in-context capability comes from the the fact that data are presented in a sequence and models are able to make use the temporal correlation between tokens when doing predictions. Has the authors investigated what order of the sequence encourages the learning of the correlations?
 
2. Why do you choose to only reduce depth when normalize the parameter counts? I thought normal practice is to reduce both the width and depth in some propotion.

### Summary
The authors probe several different model architectures for their ability to perform in-context learning, a capability primarily associated with the transformer architecture. Prior works have slightly conflicting results on this front: e.g., some works have shown LSTMs/RNNs can perform ICL, while others find that to be incorrect. By normalizing the setup and performing an extensive analysis on a bunch of both synthetic and natural tasks, the authors provide a useful study to address the question of which architectures can perform ICL and also better contextualize the debates in prior works.

### Strengths
The paper is primarily of an empirical nature and I found its analysis to be very extensive and impressive. The tasks are valuable, if not novel (to be clear, that is fine), since they cover a broad spectrum of prior works' models for understanding in-context learning in neural networks.

### Weaknesses
My primary apprehension revolves around the paper's presentation: The results, at times, read like the authors ran out of time and hence were not able to provide a sufficient discussion of what they observed in the experiments (especially for the results that show up later in the paper, which focus on more realistic tasks). Relatedly, due to the presence of a huge set of experiments in any given table, drawing any conclusions gets quite difficult and the reader has to rely on the authors' writeup. Bar plots would be a better idea than a table for presenting such dense results, since it allows easier comparisons between results.

### Questions
As the authors mention in the paper, often efficient transformer variants are used by practitioners, but results / analyses on ICL focus on its dense, quadratic complexity version. Are there any results on, e.g., linear attention's or sparse attention's ICL performance? I think adding these results will be very helpful if possible.
