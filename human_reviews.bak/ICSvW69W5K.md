# Semantic Parsing with Candidate Expressions for Knowledge Base Question Answering

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Semantic parsers convert natural language to logical forms, which can then be evaluated on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce denotations.
Early neural semantic parsers used grammars that define actions, such as production rules, then the semantic parsers could sequentially take actions to construct well-typed logical forms.
In contrast, recent neural semantic parsers have been developed with pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, such as BART and T5, which treat logical forms as sequences of tokens.
However, the seq2seq models have difficulty in learning to generate logical forms that contain components drawn from large KBs.
In this work, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for seq2seq semantic parsing on large KBs.
The grammar defines actions as production rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference under the constraints by types and candidate expressions.
We apply the grammar to knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate expressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB components.
Experiments on the KQA Pro benchmark showed that the constraints by candidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, and our semantic parser achieved state-of-the-art performance on KQA Pro.

### Confidence

### Summary
The paper presents a constraint decoding method for semantic parsing. The paper leverages pretrained neural models and tried to narrow down decoding search space by defining IR, type, candidate expressions (whitelisting) to improve semantic parser performance. It goes into details telling the reason why constraint decoding is needed and how it's implemented. Experiment is conducted against KB, and results looks good. The authors put together a complex neural semantic parsing pipeline and proposed a solution for the problem of constrained decoding for non-terminal nodes in structured decoding. On `multi-hop` and `qualifier` test sets, there are decent improvements.

### Strengths
- The constraint decoding approach shows decent improvements in experiments.
- The authors designed an intermediate representation system based on s-expression which is more generic comparing with other constrained decoding method like Picard. The candidate expression is built as a trie tree structure. Comparing with previous work, this work expands the constraints to internal nodes (non-terminal nodes) which would be helpful to narrow down search space. 
- The writing is clean and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
- This is a relatively incremental work. Constraint decoding is not a new idea which is actually widely used in semantic parsing field. The trie tree structure for candidate expression decoding is also not new (similar to GENRE). The novel part is to expand it to non-terminal node. 
- In the era of LLMs, the improvement seems marginal comparing with using large LMs and with more training data.

### Questions
- Comparing with using production rules etc, have you tried unstructured decoding method? Maybe this should be a good baseline. 
- Clearly with more data, the constrained decoding doesn't help much. Have you explored data augmentation?

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach to semantic parsing over knowledge base using candidate expressions, which improves the accuracy of semantic parsers on knowledge bases. They evaluate their approach on KQAPro and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The authors also conduct an ablation study to analyze the contribution of candidate expressions to the performance of the semantic parser. Overall, the paper's contributions include a new approach to semantic parsing using candidate expressions, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of candidate expressions in improving the accuracy of semantic parsers.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of their proposed approach, including the grammar and inference algorithm used to generate candidate expressions.
- This paper conducts an ablation study to analyze the contribution of candidate expressions to the performance of the semantic parser. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of candidate expressions and how they can be used to improve the accuracy of semantic parsers.
- The paper is of high quality, with clear and well-organized writing and thorough experimental evaluation.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of this work is its incremental contribution over previous grammar-based methods like [1] and [2]. In particular, [2] uses similar grammars for knowledge base question answering. It is unclear what new techniques or insights this work adds beyond existing grammar-based approaches for this task. To strengthen the paper, the authors could focus more on novel grammar designs or representations that improve performance.

Additionally, the experimental validation is limited to a single dataset (KQAPro). Testing the approach on an additional challenging dataset like GrailQA [3] would better verify effectiveness and generalization. With only one dataset, it is hard to determine if the performance gains are dataset-specific or represent a robust advancement for grammar-based decoding. Expanding the experimental evaluation would make the results more convincing.

In summary, clearly situating the contributions relative to prior grammar-based work and testing across more datasets could help address concerns around novelty and experimental validation. Focusing on where this work provides specific technical innovations or new insights would strengthen the paper.

### Summary
This paper proposes a grammar-based semantic parser for knowledge-based question answering. The grammars are specialized with fine-grained types and candidate expressions. During decoding, type constraints and candidate constraints can be enforced to search for the desired programs more effectively.

### Strengths
A well-executed work on designing grammars for knowledge-based question answering. The revisit of traditional grammar-based methods provides insights on whether prior information such as types are still useful in the current era of pre-trained models.  (But I also feel the question whether grammar-based constraints are still useful for large models needs to be studied more)

### Weaknesses
The main contribution, as the author points out,  is “To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to use production rules as actions for semantic parsers based on pre-trained seq2seq models.”. First, I’m not sure what is the underlying challenge of extending traditional grammar-based seq2seqs to their pretrained counterparts? That is, I'm not sure about the technical contribution of the paper. Second, there are already existing works in this direction (as cited in the related work). For example, RAT-SQL (based on BERT) extends TRANX which expands production rules incrementally during decoding.

### Questions
- What is generation speed of the grammar-based parser compared with the baseline BART? I’m wondering that with more constraints, the parser might suffer from much slower inference speed
- would it be an issue if the size of the set of candidate expressions become too large? E.g., certain class (e.g., keyword-entity) has too many candidates.

### Summary
This paper introduces a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for KB-QA. The grammar decoder enforces the type of candidate expressions during the decoding phrase. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on KQAPRO datasets. The ablation study shows the effectiveness of the method. However, the paper fails to show the proposed method works for other KB-QA tasks. And it is not sure what is the scope of the problem the proposed method could outperform the beselines.

### Strengths
* The method is proposed for KBQA tasks is noval.
* A state-of-the-art performance on KQAPRO
* The abalation study shows the effectiveness of this method

### Weaknesses
* In this paper, the performance of the model is recorded only in one KB-QA dataset. It is not known how good is this method among all KB-QA tasks.

### Questions
* Are there any results on KB-QA datasets other than KQAPRO for the proposed method? It would be better to show the performance of the proposed method on more than one dataset. The datasets could be (but not limited to) Complex Web Questions and Grail QA.

* [Not critical] This paper compares their decoding method with Picard's paper to show the proposed method has a good latency. Why are the two models in different tasks (KBQA vs Spider), different model architectures (BART vs T5), and different hardwares comparable?
