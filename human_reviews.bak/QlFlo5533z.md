- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 1, 5

## Abstract
Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has emerged as a popular method to protect personally identifiable information in deep learning (DL) applications. Unfortunately, DP-SGD's per-sample gradient clipping and uniform noise addition during training can significantly degrade model utility. To enhance the model's utility, researchers proposed various adaptive/dynamic DP-SGD methods by adapting the noise multiplier and clipping threshold. However, we examined and discovered that these established techniques result in greater privacy leakage or lower accuracy than the traditional DP-SGD method, or a lack of evaluation on a complex data set such as CIFAR100. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic DP-SGD (Auto DP-SGD). Our method automates clipping threshold estimation based on the DL model's total gradient norm and scales the gradients of each training sample instead of simply clipping them without losing gradient information or requiring an additional privacy budget. This helps to improve the algorithm's utility while using a less privacy budget. To further improve accuracy, we introduce automatic noise multiplier decay mechanisms to decrease the noise multiplier after every epoch. Finally, we develop closed-form mathematical expressions using the truncated concentrated differential privacy (tCDP) accountant, which offers a straightforward and tight privacy-bound analysis for automatic noise multiplier and automatic clipping estimation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Auto DP-SGD outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification results in privacy and accuracy on various benchmark datasets. We also show that privacy can be improved by lowering the scale factor and using learning rate schedulers without significantly reducing privacy. Moreover, we also explain how to select the best Auto DP-SGD variant without additional privacy leakage. Specifically, Auto DP-SGD, when used with a step noise multiplier (Auto DP-SGD-S), improves accuracy by 3.20\%, 1.57\%, 6.73\%, and 1.42\% for the MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and AG News Corpus datasets, respectively. Furthermore, we achieve a substantial reduction in the privacy budget ($\epsilon$) of 94.9\%, 79.16\%, 67.36\%, and 53.37\% for the corresponding data sets.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new privacy-preserving deep-learning training scheme, based on the existing DPSGD methods. The authors provide some theoretical explanation of the proposed method and verify the method on some classic datasets. The results show the proposed method has great performance on the utility.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a detailed intro about the main analytic tools in DP and use them in the following part
2. The experiment parts are shown in detail with high reproductivity.

### Weaknesses
1. Presentation: 1) the authors need to clearly present some theoretical novelty and show some privacy preservation guarantee in the main context, together with the assumptions.
2) Some preliminary can be set in the Appendix.
3) some line spacing  is not well in the main context
2. Contents:
1) the related work needs to include more work in these two years. Much related DPSGD work is suitable here and I believe a table for the comparison might be better.
2) some magnitude about the privacy level should be shown, I just see some examples with the given values and am confused by the quantity. Some theoretical analysis should be given about how much improvement of the privacy level or utility level, is compared with the standard DPSGD.
3) More clarification about why the proposed method is important. I think it is just adjusting the variance level of DPSGD, it should influence the utility, but what we can lose in the privacy level should be presented. (Or what we derive)
4) More datasets should be considered since CIFAR is not enough for paper with the experiments consisting of the most parts. Large ones should be used.
5) Large $\epsilon$ seems to be meaningless in DP, but there are very large ones shown in the experiments.
6) how are parameters determined in the real treatment, like scaling factors, or variants. Some criteria should be shown.

### Summary
The paper proposes Auto-DPSGD, a modified version of the DPSGD algorithm. Compared with the original DPSGD, Auto DP-SGD incorporates automatic clipping and noise multiplier scheduling.

### Strengths
Improving the privacy-utility trade-off of DPSGD is an interesting problem.

### Weaknesses
1. Auto DP-SGD does not satisfy differential privacy, because the noise that it injects into the gradient sum is a computed from the individual gradient norms, whereas individual gradient norms are private information. 

To illustrate this issue, consider an extreme case where all records in the input dataset D have zero gradients. In that case, in Auto DP-SGD the distribution of the noisy gradient is degenerated to the point of zero (because s_t = 0 in Auto DP-SGD). Now consider neighboring dataset D’ that has one non-zero gradient. The noisy gradient sum distribution of D’ is a Gaussian (because s_t is non-zero). Comparing these two distributions of D and D’, it is apparently that they have unbounded divergence. This indicates a violation of differential privacy.

2. I am not convinced by the the authors’ claims that "CDP and zCDP accountants lack privacy amplification by sampling" and "the RDP accountant Abadi et al. (2016) overestimates privacy costs". Both CDP and RDP enjoy the same level of privacy amplification by subsampling, since they are both based on the Renyi divergence and can be converted to each other in many cases. Previous papers (e.g., see https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220076) have also used CDP in DPSGD.

3. It is not a common practice to evaluate the performance of DP training algorithms on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 *only* on pertained models. Please refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13650.pdf for more comprehensive evaluation setups.

4. The paper misses existing work on automatic clipping and privacy budget scheduling. For example, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220076 for one of the first papers that propose to use an adaptive privacy budget scheduling for DPSGD, and see https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07136 for automatic clipping.

### Summary
This paper studies DP-SGD with a new way to estimate the clipping threshold automatically. It also proposes three ad-hoc noise multiplier decay mechanisms. Some experiments are provided on (mostly) toy models and toy datasets.

### Strengths
The proposed DP-SGD seems new and the experiments cover many aspects including learning rate, noise schedule, and task types.

### Weaknesses
1. First thing first, this paper is over the ICLR page limit (9 pages). This paper may be desk-rejected. Also some margins are violated by, for example, Table 2,3,4.

2. The contribution is not enough and not significant, e.g. the original content from this work only starts from page 5. Specifically, one of the "claimed" contribution is the proposal of three new noise multiplier decay mechanisms: Auto DP-T/S/E. However, Auto DP-S/E are useless according to Table 16 and thus not present in the main text. This is trivial novelty.

3. The proposed Algorithm 1 is computationally infeasible, essentially setting batch size as 1, and even so is memory prohibitive. Unlike modern DP-SGD, which takes batch size 64 for one back-propagation and can be as memory efficient as non-DP SGD (see "Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost"), Algorithm 1 needs 64 back-propagations and takes too long to train. As for the memory, the gradient list G from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 requires to store B*model_size parameter (B being batch size). This is impossible for large models with over 1B parameters, whereas state-of-the-art DP-SGD can already handle 100B parameters. In fact, I am shocked that the obvious computation inefficiency is not discussed in work.

4. Performance is too weak, datasets are too easy and comparison to old benchmarks is unfair. E.g. SOTA CIFAR100 at epsilon=2 is around 90%, where the authors got 79%; achieving >98% on MNIST can be traced back to 2020 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14191.pdf).

5. The name "Auto DP-SGD" is already used in other papers, possibly making the readers confused.

### Summary
In this paper, various noise multiplier decay methods and different learning rate schedules were proposed and compared to identify a more effective approach for implementing DP-SGD, aiming to enhance accuracy.

### Strengths
This paper introduced and compared several noise multiplier decay methods and different learning rate schedules to identify a more effective approach for implementing DP-SGD, with the goal of enhancing accuracy

### Weaknesses
The effectiveness of both the adaptive clipping methods and the proposed learning rate schedules relies on experimental evidence. Consequently, conducting thorough experiments across a diverse range of machine learning models and datasets is imperative to assess the efficacy of these methods. Regrettably, this comprehensive evaluation is absent in this paper.

Furthermore, considering that hyperparameter tuning necessitates an additional DP budget, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether the effectiveness of the proposed methods stems from their inherent capabilities alone or if optimized hyperparameters have been employed to enhance their performance.

### Questions
According to my understand, DP protect the membership of input data, but how 
does DP  protect "personally identifiable information (PII) in deep learning (DL) applications." as you claimed in the paper?
