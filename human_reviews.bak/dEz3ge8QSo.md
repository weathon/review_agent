## Abstract
Robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and risk-sensitive MDPs are both powerful tools for making decisions in the presence of uncertainties. Previous efforts have aimed to establish their connections, revealing equivalences in specific formulations. This paper introduces a new formulation for risk-sensitive MDPs, which assesses risk in a slightly different manner compared to the classical Markov risk measure [Ruszczy ́nski 2010], and establishes its equivalence with a class of soft robust MDP (RMDP) problems, including the standard RMDP as a special case. Leveraging this equivalence, we further derive the policy gradient theorem for both problems, proving gradient domination and global convergence of the exact policy gradient method under the tabular setting with direct parameterization. This forms a sharp contrast to the Markov risk measure, known to be potentially non-gradient-dominant [Huang et al. 2021]. We also propose a sample-based offline learning algorithm, namely the robust fitted-Z iteration (RFZI), for a specific soft RMDP problem with a KL-divergence regularization term (or equivalently the risk-sensitive MDP with an entropy risk measure). We showcase its streamlined
design and less stringent assumptions due to the equivalence and analyze its sample complexity.

### Summary
The paper establishes an equivalence between a specific class of regularised robust Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the risk-sensitive MDP. The authors derive the exact policy gradient method and demonstrate its global convergence in tabular-setting MDP. Specifically, the authors study the regularised MDP with KL divergence regularisation term, and design the sample-based offline learning algorithm, robust fitted-Z iteration.

### Strengths
The paper bridges two distinct types of MDP, and introduces a policy gradient method to compute their solutions. The theoretical equivalences between these MDP types are intriguing. Moreover, the proposed algorithm demonstrates global convergence. The writing of the paper is good.

### Weaknesses
The framework of the robust MDP and risk-sensitive MDP is not clear enough: The authors fail to explicitly differentiate between stationary and non-stationary policies, as well as between stochastic and deterministic policies. While Equations (1) and (2) suggest that the authors are considering a robust MDP with a non-stationary and deterministic policy, Equations (7) and (8) indicate a stationary and stochastic policy for the risk-sensitive MDP. A similar inconsistency is observed in the transition kernel: while the robust MDP seems to consider the worst-case transition kernel for each time horizon (as evidenced by the decision variables in the infimum problem of Equations (1) and (2)), the risk-sensitive MDP presumes the existence of a transition kernel that is independent of time $t$.

### Questions
1. Within the framework of risk-sensitive MDP, the value function for a given policy $\pi$, denoted as $\tilde{V}^{\pi}(s)$, is defined by equation (7). The optimal value function, $\tilde{V}^\star$, is defined as $\max_{\pi} \tilde{V}^{\pi}$. Could the authors elucidate how $\tilde{V}^\star$ satisfies the equation (9)?

2. As noted in remark 7, the sample complexity of the proposed algorithm appears less favorable than that detailed in reference [11], assuming that there is no function approximation error in authors' approach, $\epsilon_c = 0$. What then are the advantages of the corresponding RFZI algorithm?
Furthermore, given the resemblance between Equations (7) and (9) and the traditional Bellman equation, and considering that the operators are proven contractions, is it feasible for the authors to employ value iteration or policy iteration to resolve the MDP? Such methods should theoretically exhibit rapid (geometric) convergence and remain unaffected by unknown exact gradients present in policy gradient methods.

3. At the end of remark 7, the authors claim that the choice of $\beta$ should not be too large or too small, and would be better if it is on the same scale with $1-\gamma$. $\beta$ is the radius of the ambiguity set related to transition kernel and $\gamma$ is the discounted factor. It seems unconventional to determine the ambiguity set's radius based solely on the discount factor. Could this choice be elaborated upon?

4. In 'E.2 Proof of theorem 2 (infinite horizon case)' on page 23, the authors claim that it is not hard to show $\lim_{h\to +\infty} \bar{V}^\star_{0:h} = \bar{V}^\star, \lim_{h\to +\infty} \bar{V}^{\pi}_{0:h} = \bar{V}^{\pi}$. This assertion doesn't immediately resonate with me. Would it be possible to furnish a detailed proof for this claim? Subsequent statements, $\bar{V}^\star = \mathcal{T}^\star \bar{V}^\star $ and $\bar{V}^\pi = \mathcal{T}^\pi \bar{V}^\star $ also require clarification.

### Confidence

### Summary
The authors provide a sufficient condition for establishing the equivalence between the regularized robust MDPs and risk-sensitive MDPs, and provide the optimal policy for them when the condition is satisfied. Under some assumptions, the authors provide a quasi-policy gradient algorithm with a global convergence rate. They also provide KL-regularized RMDPs as an instantiation of their framework.

### Strengths
The theoretical contribution is inspiring. I like theorem 2 where the authors provide an elegant sufficient condition for the equivalence of regularized RMDPs and risk-sensitve MDPs.

### Weaknesses
Could the authors provide some examples where theorem 2 is applied to establish the equivalence between some popular regularized RMDPs and risk-sensitve MDPs?

### Questions
- In section 2, the authors introduce convex risk measures, where there is only one input in the measure $\sigma$ in (5) and (6), while there are two in examples 1 and 2. Could the authors explain what is the difference between these two $\sigma$'s?

- What is "direct parameterization"?

- Is the right-hand side of (15) independent of the initial distribution $\rho$?

- About the feasible region $\mathcal{X}$ of $\theta$: why it is of dimension $SA$? And why each subvector $\theta_s$ should be in the probability simplex?

- Assumption 1, typo in the first sentence.

- Assumption 3, what is the norm with subscript "$2,\mu$"?

### Summary
The paper presents an extension of robust MDP that replaces the uncertainty set for the uncertain transition matrix with a penalty for the adversary. Connections are made between this approach and risk sensitive MDPs when the policy is deterministic. For the case of a penalty of the form of KL divergence, the regularized robust MDP reduces to a risk averse MDP with a nested entropic risk measure. A value iteration approach à la Fei et al. (2021) is proposed to solve the problem. When a stochastic policy is used, the property of gradient domination under direct parametrization is established.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written. The notation is clear and proofs appear all accurate based on the amount of time I could invest in checking them. The paper makes connection with many different streams of the literature: robust MPD, risk measures, gradient dominance, etc.

### Weaknesses
My main concerns are three-fold:

1) Theorem 2 holds only for risk measures \sigma that satisfy quasi-concave and does not hold if the policy is regularized. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿Indeed,  first I enocurage the authors to have a look at Delage et al. (2019) for an investigation of what risk measures have the mixture quasi-concave property and the implications in terms of optimality of randomized policies. Even in the case of mixture quasi-concave risk measures (such as CVaR and entropic risk measure), I find this result to be problematic. First, it implies that the regularized robust MDP will underestimate the risk of stochastic policies (as it is taking the average). Second, the equivalence fails if one include policy regularization which could force the optimal policy to become stochastic, thus misestimated by regularized RMDP. I would therefore limit the connection to a dynamic risk preference relation (see Pichlet et al. 2021) setting of the form:  RPR( [r_1,…, r_infty] ) = rho_0( r_1 + gamma E[ rho_1( r_2 + gamma E[ rho_2(… ) |a_2 ]|s_2)|a_1]).    where I would emphasize that the policies effect is treated as risk neutral and the transitions as risk averse.

2) Many of the results appear to follow closely from existing work. ﻿     
Theorem 1 comes from [27]. The equivalence between soft robust optimization and convex risk measure is already established in Ben-Tal et al. (2010). It is therefore no surprise that the result in theorem 2 would hold. Theorem 3, Lemma 2, and Theorem 4 extend the result of [85] from robust MPD to the slighlty more general regularized/soft robust MDP. Section 5 proposes an algorithm that resembles the approach presented in [24] although I am not aware of a sample complexity result for that class of algorithm.

3) The concept of regularized robust is misleading. In problem (2) it is the adversarial transition probability matrix that is being regularized. This is completely different from regularizing the policy as is usually understood as "regularized MDP”. I would suggesting calling it differently to avoid this confusion. Namely, in the robust optimization literature, the concept of regularizing the adversaries actions is referred as soft-robust, comprehensive robust, or globalized robust optimization (see references below).

Proof to verify:
Page 34, in equation (25), it should be illustrated how the second inequality holds, which seems not obvious.


Typos/clarifications:

Page 5, in the middle "Risk-Sensitive MDPs" misspell "Senstive"
Page 5, the line above equation (7), misspell "valule"
Page 8, Assumption 1, "For any policy pi and " missing P
Page 25, paragraph under section C, last part, repeat expression "is defined as is defined as”
Page 26, the notation would be clearer if the two “T^\pi” and “T^*” operators were denoted as “bar T^\pi” and “bar T^*” since they are defined in terms of the robust MDP
Page 26, last part of Proof of Lemma1, "Lemma 1 is an immediate corollary of Lemma 8", it should be Lemma 3. "\tilde V and \tilde V^\star in (4) and (3)", it should be (7) and (9).
Page 27, in Lemma 4, the definition of \mathcal{T}^* should be clarified.
Page 28, In the proof of Lemma 4, \mathbb{E}{s_1\sim \hat{P}{0}  should have a uniform expression as the passages above and below, i.e., \mathbb{E}{s_1\sim \hat{P}{0;s_0,a_0}.
In line 4, there is a missing bracket in the last equation.
Page 32, in Part G, the performance Difference Lemma [40] should be stated separately, as it has been applied a lot of times in the proofs. It is better to illustrate how this lemma is applied to this specific case.

### Summary
This work introduces an alternative formulation of risk-sensitive MDP (RS-MDP in the sequel) that enables to show equivalence with regularized-RMDPs. Leveraging this equivalence, the authors derive a converging risk-sensitive policy-gradient method that asymptotically recovers the optimal value and policy of Markov RS-MDPs. Thus, they tackle the potential non-gradient domination of the Markov RS-MDP setting. Focusing on KL-regularized RMDP, an offline algorithm called RFZI is then introduced, that presumably improves upon the RFQI algorithm of [61] in terms of computational complexity and required assumptions.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and the mathematical setting rigorously specified.

The reformulation via regularized-robustness to provide a converging policy-gradient is crafty.

### Weaknesses
- It would be preferable to give more space to motivate this work rather than explaining the method (see suggestions below)

- To me it is a bit frustrating to see so many references in the bibliography with no discussion of them in the text body. Specifically, how does the regularization term of this work compare to [18]? Also, the regularized+robust objective considered in this work reminds that of [32] who also combine the two to derive a convex formulation of RMDPs. This leads me to the following question: does the same convex formulation applies to the authors' regularized RMDPs? Is it the aforementioned convex property that ensures gradient domination in this setting as well?  

- As mentioned in Rmk 4, sampling from $\hat{P}^{\theta}$ rather than the nominal represents the main challenge in estimating the policy-gradient. In this respect, we refer to the work [101] that explicitly formulate the policy gradient in RMDPs: by focusing on $\ell_p$-ball constrained uncertainty sets, the authors are able to explicitly derive the worst transition model and as a result, a robust policy-gradient that is more amenable to be estimated from nominal samples. In fact, I assume that specific assumptions on the convex risk measure $\sigma$ can similarly be leveraged to explicit a risk-sensitive gradient. For example, departing from the equivalence between coherent risk measures and RMDPs with risk envelope, one may write a robust policy-gradient as in [101] and broaden the class of measures to be considered while preserving tractability of the gradient. 

- The offline learning part is a bit of an outlier in this paper. In particular, I do not understand the motivation to section 5. Simulation experiments on the other hand, would study the risk-sensitive behavior of regularized-robust optimal policies and compare them to robust optimal policies.  

- It is not clear to me how the performance gap of Thm 5 compares to that of RFQI [61]. The authors briefly mention the computational cost incurred by introducing dual variables in [61], but the performance gap obtained from each approach should further be discussed. More generally, Sec. 5 raises several open questions without further discussing them, which is a bit frustrating: can Assm 2 be avoided? How to empirically select the penalty factor $\beta$ and shrink the performance gap? Is the exponential dependence a proof artifact or is it intrinsic to the problem?

### Questions
Questions:
- I found the second paragraph of Sec. 1 quite confusing: "when the model is given", "in cases of unknown models... most are model-based for tabular cases", "model-free setting". How are the shortcomings mentioned in this paragraph addressed in the present work? How do the authors distinguish between "unknown model" and "model-free"? Does it refer to the uncertainty set or the nominal model? For example, in my understanding, [48] is model-free in the sense that it does not take the uncertainty set as given but estimates it from data. Accordingly, most robust learning approaches are model-based in the sense that they consider the uncertainty set to be known and solve robust planning from there. 
- Rmk 1 was also confusing to me. What do the authors mean by "the boundary of the uncertainty set"? What is a "hard boundary"? Referring here to the fact that $(\hat{P}_t)_t$ are in the whole simplex for regularized RMDPs, as opposed to a specified uncertainty set $\mathcal{P}$ in RMDPs would greatly help understanding the authors' motivation for that setting. Also, is this remark related to the discussion on "model-free" vs "model-based" in the intro? 
- Thm 1 seems to simply relate the double Fenchel conjugate with the original function. Is it what it does? If so, it would be useful to mention it in the text and if not, how is this result different? 
- Could you please provide an intuitive explanation as to why the value function is different from Markov risk measures of previous works when the policy is stochastic, but the same when it is deterministic?
 
 
Suggested corrections: 
- Last line of Sec. 1: "appendix" without capital letter
- Typo "valule" right before Eq. (7)
- Eqs. (12), (14), (18) are numbered without being referred to in the text.
- Missing capital letters in references: Markov in [6, 10, 32, 35, 36, 43, 48, 54, 59, 71, 94] and others, Bellman in [4]
- Published/workshop papers should be referred as such: [16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 40, 44, 52, 61, 78, 85, 96]
- I do not see the utility of the paragraph on finite-horizon (referred to as (*) in the following item), to explain the fixed point equation (7). This is standard in MDPs and would save some valuable space that seems to be missing in this work. Instead, it would be useful to briefly mention the properties of the operator (7) -- monotonicity, sub-distributivity, contraction -- and how they follow from those of the convex risk measure $\sigma$. 
- Sec. 3 is very short. I would rather incorporate the "risk-sensitive MDPs"-paragraph of Sec. 2 into that one. 
- In general, I think that the authors could and should shrink some parts of the text to better motivate their approach, and defer some explanation details of their method to the appendix. For example, Ex. 2 could be removed/put into appendix, as it is not further used in the paper (as opposed to Ex. 1); the paragraph (*) could be removed completely. As such, instead of declaring "Due to space limit, we defer a detailed literature review and numerical simulations to the appendix", the authors could provide more synthetic exposition of their method, but detail more on its positioning w.r.t. previous works. Please see my questions in that respect. 
- In the same spirit of saving space, the "other notations" paragraph at the end of Sec. 2 could be written inline and deferred to the "MDPs" paragraph at the beginning of Sec. 2; Remarks may be written as regular text.
