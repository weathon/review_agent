# How Far Have We Gone in Vulnerability Detection Using Large Language Model

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
In an era where software grows increasingly complex and suffers from vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability detection is vitally important yet remains a challenging task. The remarkable generalizability exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains heightens our anticipation of their capabilities in vulnerability detection. Still, the lack of quantitative performance measurements hinders a clear understanding of these models' potential.
Addressing this, we present \dsname, a high-quality, comprehensive vulnerability benchmark. \dsname has amassed high-quality vulnerability data derived from an extensive array of CTF challenges and real-world applications. This benchmark annotates each vulnerable function, specifying the vulnerability type and root cause of the vulnerability.
We conduct extensive experiments involving existing solutions, assessing a total of 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in vulnerability detection. The evaluation result uncovers a paradox in performance levels and highlights the untapped potential of LLMs. Our work makes a significant advancement toward understanding and harnessing the power of LLMs for more secure software systems.

### Summary
Vulnerability detection's primary goal is to discover software security threats, which is essential for mitigating cyber-attacks. The authors present a study on the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vulnerability detection. By selecting a variety of LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as other open source models, the authors compare the performance of these LLMs against deep learning models and static analysis tools. The benchmarks consist of various datasets, both artificial like CTF and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
The authors have chosen a diverse range of models, encompassing popular GPT versions, open-source models. This wide variety ensures a thorough comparison for LLMs.

The inclusion of real-world datasets ensures practical relevance. By comparing performance on artificial datasets like CTF versus real-world datasets, the paper provides a holistic view of LLM capabilities.

It's commendable that the authors also address the limitations of LLMs, especially in real-world scenarios where context might be lacking or in decompiled code scenarios.

### Weaknesses
While the paper does compare performances between different LLMs, the "why" behind these performances could be elaborated upon. Understanding the intricacies of each model might explain why some models performed better than others. For example, architectural nuances, the type and quality of training data, or the model's inherent design could influence performance.

Also the baseline models (traditional deep learning and static analysis tools) could be explored in more depth. More insights into why and where they outperformed or underperformed compared to LLMs would be valuable.

When LLMs incorrectly classify vulnerabilities, understanding the nature of these mistakes (whether they are false positives or false negatives) would be invaluable. This could be complemented by representative examples to highlight common pitfalls the models encounter.

The paper does discuss the limitations of decompiled code, but a deeper dive into how these limitations impacted the results and the potential solutions or workarounds would add value.

Minor Issues:
The reference should have been revised. Some preprints have been published, e.g., 'CodeXGLUE: A Machine Learning Benchmark Dataset for Code Understanding and Generation' is published on NeurIPS 2021. 

Abbreviation should be consistent e.g., 'Cve' and 'CVE'.

Typo in reference '$\mu$'

### Questions
I'm just curious if LLMs can perform well on zero-day vulnerabilities. 

Could you provide some examples of false positives or false negatives?

### Summary
The paper introduces a vulnerability benchmark for investigating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vulnerability detection.

The authors conduct extensive experiments involving existing solutions, assessing 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in vulnerability detection. Via the authors’ claim, the evaluation result uncovers a paradox in performance levels and highlights the untapped potential of LLMs.

### Strengths
The authors have introduced a combined dataset for evaluating LLMs’ vulnerability detection abilities. They have designed and conducted a comprehensive evaluation process to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of Language Models (LLMs).

### Weaknesses
The claim “We thoroughly analyze their strengths and weaknesses in vulnerability detection tasks, identifying areas for improvement and future research directions” is not clearly explained case by case in the paper. The authors mainly focus on ChatGPT. How about other LLMs used in the paper? Notably, what are the areas for improvement and future research directions?

The finding relevant to “the lack of context” in the statement “on larger software platforms, due to the lack of context, LLMs do not sufficiently comprehend vulnerabilities” is one of the well-known limitations of LLMs in text data. LLMs strongly rely on the relevant context instead of the data themselves. The lack of context of the appearance of irrelevant context strongly negatively affects the LLM's performance.

The novelty of the proposed framework (not applicable in the paper because the paper was not going to propose any innovative framework for vulnerability detection) or dataset is limited. The introduced dataset is simply from a combination of some datasets.

The aspect that is relevant to the characteristics in terms of the semantic and syntactic relationships of the source code data is not mentioned or studied. From many state-of-the-art deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods, to deal with vulnerability detection, the models need to be successful in leveraging the semantic and syntactic relationships between the code tokens and source code statements. That helps the model figure out potential vulnerabilities in the data to distinguish the vulnerable and benign data. Failing to learn the important properties of the source code data can also be another limitation of LLMs in vulnerability detection.

### Questions
There are many big and well-known datasets (consisting of various types of vulnerability) ready to be used for vulnerability detection, such as Big-Vul (Fan et al., 2020b) and DiverseVul (Chen et al., 2023). What are the advantages of the introduced dataset compared to these ones?

What are the main strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in vulnerability detection case by case and in general found in the paper? What are your corresponding suggestions to deal with these limitations?

The combination of some datasets to form the used dataset, VulBench, are random or are there any insightful intuitions for that?

### Summary
This paper presents a benchmark called VulBench for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and state-of-the-art methods in automated vulnerability detection. The benchmark comprises vulnerability data collected from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, security flaws reported by fuzzing tools, and existing vulnerability detection benchmarks, with annotations specifying the type and root cause of each vulnerability. The paper conducts extensive experiments involving 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art methods to assess their effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities. The results reveal a paradox in performance levels and suggest that LLMs have untapped potential in this domain.

### Strengths
+ This paper sheds light on new resources to collect software vulnerabilities to evaluate the automated vulnerability detectors. They identify two useful resources, CTF and fuzzing reported security flaws, which can potentially compensate for the diversity of the common strategy to focus on Github commits to extract vulnerable and benign code snippets. Also, the well-controlled CTF challenges have few label noises compared to samples collected from Github commits, since the changed function in a commit might not directly relate to the vulnerability while they are typically sampled and noisily labeled by existing benchmarks.
+ This paper conducts extensive evaluation on 16 models with up to tens/hundreds of billions of parameters while existing works mostly evaluate smaller code LMs with at max hundreds of millions of parameters. The experiments tend to reveal a more up-to-date SOTA performance from the most capable LLMs, though even these latest models seem not to significantly outperform the smaller models and not promising enough in vulnerability detection.

### Weaknesses
__The main contributions of VulBench are neither clearly specified nor sufficiently evaluated.__ As a datasets/benchmark paper, the most important contribution should be the additional value it brings, compared to the existing benchmarks of the same type. However, such contributions are not clear in this paper.

First, though the paper identifies new resources to collect vulnerable samples, it is not clear how different and valuable these new resources and samples are, compared to the existing benchmarks. I would recommend the author illustrate the value of these samples, such as whether they cover unique CWEs that existing benchmarks do not have, or whether they compensate for specific types of low-resource vulnerabilities, etc. In addition, in Section 3.2.3, it is quite vague how VulBench cleans up Devign, D2A, and BigVul, and also not clear how accurate the labels are after their filtering. I would recommend the authors to concretize the effects of the cleaning and filtering, such as what was the ratio of noisy labels in the original benchmark and how does that improve with VulBench's version.

Second, the comparison between VulBench and existing benchmarks is missing. To illustrate the value of the new benchmark, the most effective way is to directly compare with the existing benchmarks to explain what are the difference. However, the evaluation of this paper focuses on comparing the CTF split and real-world split of its own benchmark and ignores to compare VulBench, as a whole, to Devign, D2A, and BigVul. I would suggest the authors to evaluate the 16 LLMs on these existing benchmarks as well and conduct a thorough analysis to reveal what perspectives could not be well studied by existing benchmarks, while VulBench's additional resources and sample filtering help, serving as a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of LLMs' capacity in vulnerability detection than others.

__The dataset contains many reversed decompiled code, questioning the naturalness and reality of these code samples.__ While I agree that the samples from CTF and MAGMA bring better diversity than focusing on Github commit, the decompiled code samples from these resources are concerning. The decompiled source code could be quite different from realistic programs written by human, and there could be instinct patterns or data structures that are hardcoded by the decompilation tool but rarely or never used by the developers. Though the authors mentioned that they try their best to make the decompiled samples look natural by variable renaming, etc, it is not clear how effective their decorations are to bring back the code naturalness. I would encourage the authors to quantify, beyond only case studies, how (un)natural these decompiled samples are compared to human-written code, and this is important to estimate the usefulness and reality of the benchmark to evaluate LLM's capability in vulnerability detection in the real-world scenario.


__The main methodology of this paper, the dataset construction process, is rather brief and vague, missing details and illustrations for understanding.__ In general, Section 3.2, as the explanation of the main methodology is not understandable and lacks details. For 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, it is better to assume that audiences have no background in CTF problems and fuzzing, so more details should be explained (maybe in Appendix), such as what are the format of CTF problems and fuzzing reports, and how the labels are constructed accordingly. A few concrete examples from the raw data to the benchmark samples will be appreciated. This will not only increase the readability but also the reliability of the sample labels.

__The benchmark is not available for review so far.__ Somehow I could not find the link to this benchmark. For this paper, the benchmark itself is the major output, and I might need to manually inspect the quality of tens of samples to determine the general quality of this work. Due to the brief and vague description of the approach, I would urge the authors to anonymously release the benchmark for reviewers to directly evaluate the quality. Of course, if I accidentally missed the link somewhere, please correct me.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide more details of how CTF dataset is formulated, like what the raw challenge looks like, and what information will be exacted for labeling, etc?

- What is the ratio of noisy labels being removed by VulBench from Devign, D2A, and Big-Vul?

- Will the authors anonymously release the benchmark for review?

## Human Reviewer 4

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
A new vulnerability dataset derived from CTF challenges and real-world applications is proposed in this work. The dataset provides annotations of each vulnerable function with the vulnerability type and descriptions of root cause of the vulnerability with a goal to enable improved evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities in vulnerability detections. Additionally, this paper evaluates 16 LLMs and 6 SOTA models using the proposed benchmark and presents some insights about LLMs performance levels with few shot prompts and increased context windows.

### Strengths
* Investigation of LLMs capabilities and shortcomings with respect to vulnerable code identification is a critical challenge with great potential for future innovations.

* The proposed benchmark includes both synthetic and real world vulnerabilities. Isolation of synthetic and real world vulnerabilities in performance analysis provides useful insights.

### Weaknesses
The proposed work combines different synthetic and exisiting real world vulnerabilities and adds annotations to evaluate LLMs. However, it is not clear how comprehensive is the new dataset. I think the work lacks evidences on two aspects of the dataset:
1) Vulnerability coverage: how much coverage the proposed dataset have in different types of vulnerabilities?
2) Advantages over existing benchmarks: Extensive experiments are performed on LLMs and compartive analysis with other DL and static analysis methods are presented. However, it is not clear what new and critical insights one can derive using the proposed benchmark compared to existing dataset like MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2023a) or dataset used in Cheshkov et al. (2023).

### Questions
1. Is there any new vulnerability added that was not part of any of the previous benchmarks?
2. It would be interesting to see if there is any specific vulnerability class where LLMs have increased detection capabilities. Do you have any insights based on the experiments conducted in this work?
3. Could you elaborate the inputs used in Figure-5? More specifically, what does “providing all functions” indicate? How are the context limitations maintained in this setup?
4. Nit: I think ‘multi-classification’ is not a standard terminology. A more standard and specific term like “multi-label” or “multi-class” classification would provide increased clarity of the evaluation approach.
