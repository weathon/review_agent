- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
Recent advances in federated learning (FL) enable collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients while protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are heterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not adequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting in lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew effect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the disadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client applications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the principles of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we propose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian fairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy among clients; (2)  equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving egalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance optimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client; both are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or decentralized. We formulate EFFL as a multi-constrained multi-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and egalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk losses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a gradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions within the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a high-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all clients.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper investigates fairness in FL on both accuracy and decision bias. The authors propose a three-stage optimization method to optimize the proposed constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Numerical results show the benefits of the algorithm in terms of fairness.

### Strengths
1. Considering both accuracy and decision bias is promising and important to FL research.
2. The proposed multi-objective optimization problem is straightforward.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed algorithm, as described in Algorithm 1 (line 6), necessitates unbiased gradients in each communication round. However, conventional federated learning algorithms typically employ local SGD, rendering the gradients hard to compute.
2. Some comments regarding related works appear to be unfair. For instance, in [1], a certain degree of performance inequality is permitted within an acceptable threshold, defined as the "fair area."
3. The motivation for dividing the optimization method into three stages is not well-explained. It remains unclear whether the algorithm's performance would change if the first two stages were eliminated.
4. The experiments conducted on real datasets involve only 2 or 11 clients. It is advisable to include cross-device scenarios with hundreds of clients for a more comprehensive analysis.

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate on how to implement the proposed algorithm when employing local SGD, a common approach in most federated learning papers?

2. Could the authors provide more detailed explanations and perform ablation studies to justify the design choices for the three stages of the algorithm?

### Summary
This paper examines the problem of fairness in a federated learning setting through the lens of MCMOO. The goal is to reduce global loss while satisfying several constraints: (1) Roughly equal loss/accuracy for each individual client; (2) Fairness at each individual client, i.e., low local unfairness; and (3) Local unfairness at each client is also roughly equal to global which reduces to "equal" unfairness at each client, i.e., equal local unfairness. The MCMOO problem is addressed by breaking it down into a three-stage optimization process where some of the stages are constrained optimizations. The approach to solving MCMOO has several interesting ideas that involve cleverly controlling the direction of the gradient such that certain other metrics do not increase.
Experimental results are provided on a synthetic dataset, Adult (2 clients), and eICU (11 clients).

### Strengths
Some of these points have already been discussed in the Summary.
Formulating the problem as an MCMOO and then attempting to solve it as a three-stage process is a good contribution. The approach to solving MCMOO has several interesting concepts that involve cleverly controlling the direction of the gradient such that certain other metrics do not increase.
They have also provided experimental results with several baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. Such MCMOO problems are known to be quite difficult and unstable sometimes. Could the authors comment on the stability of their strategy? 

2. One weakness is that there is no theoretical guarantee on why this algorithm will converge, and under what conditions would it diverge. Is it possible to formalize the intuitions of Fig. 2 into a theorem? Or, at least discuss some scenarios where it would diverge.
For instance, there are also impossibility results on group fairness in federated learning in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11333 

3. The word Egalitarian is a bit confusing here. I would think Egalitarian would mean equal accuracy/loss across clients. But, in addition to that, there is also a group fairness criterion with local and global fairness constraints. Using the word "group" fairness at places would make it more clear.

4. For what class of fairness metrics would the algorithm work? Please comment.

5. Could the authors also elaborate on the communication cost when there is a maximum since to obtain the maximum also one needs all the values? How is communication complexity improved?

Additional Limitations:
There is no discussion on the privacy of this approach in a federated context.

### Summary
This paper studies fairness in federated learning with. Specifically, it considers two types of fairness. The first one is the Matthew effect, which considers the performance across different clients; and the second one is the decision bias, which is a class of commonly studied fairness definitions like accuracy parity or equal opportunity across different demographic groups. The authors formulate the problem as a multi-constrained multi-objective optimization problem and propose a 3-stage solution to gradually search the optimal hypothesis in a more constrained hypothesis space. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over baseline methods.

### Strengths
S1. Fair federated learning is a practical problem, and it is good to 

S2. The 3-stage solution is interesting.

S3. Experimental results show the effectiveness on the tested datasets over baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
W1. The paper needs stronger motivation to support the need of two fairness considerations. Right now it feels more like two fairness considerations are both important, so we will consider them simultaneously. Is it possible to provide some real-world examples or use cases?

W2. Fig. 1 (a) is too hypothetical to support the claim that poor model could impair data generation capabilities and worsening the performance gap over time.

W3. Is there any trade-off or correlation between the Matthew effect and APSD/TPSD? For example, if we only improve the Matthew effect, the accuracy of poorer model might increase, and it may further help reduce APSD/TPSD. Is it possible to show empirical analysis about it (e.g., ablation study)?

W4. In Definition 1, $f_k(h)$ is constrained to be no larger than $\epsilon_b$, and $\{f_k(h) - {\bar f}(h)\}$ is also constrained to be less than $\epsilon_{vb}$. Is it possible that enforcing these two set of constraints could hurt a fair local client? Consider a case where the global model is almost perfectly fair, $f_k(h) \approx 0$, but violate $f_k(h) - {\bar f}(h) \leq \epsilon_{vb}$. Then it might be possible to increase $f_k(h)$ (i.e., making it more biased) to enforce $f_k(h) - {\bar f}(h) \leq \epsilon_{vb}$.

W5. In several places, the authors mention that existing works cannot narrow the gap between worse-performing clients and better-performing clients. I don't understand why the claim is true. For example, minimax-based solution will always minimize the worst-performing clients so naturally it could reduce the disparity among different clients' performance. Is it possible to elaborate the reason more clearly?

W6. It feels a bit conflicting that the authors say minimax cannot narrow the gap among clients' performance but still solve a minimax problem in stages 2 and 3.

W7. Is there any analysis to show the convergence of the proposed method? The authors simply claim it can obtain the convergent solution.

### Summary
This work proposes EFFL a client fairness approach that aims to mitigate the Mathew effect by producing a Pareto optimal model with equal decision bias and accuracy across the participating clients. EFFL problem is formulated as a MOOP with decision bias and fairness constraints. The authors provide a 3-step algorithm for solving this objective and perform experiments that showcase superior performance compared to various other baselines on a synthetic dataset and 2 real datasets.

### Strengths
* Addressing the combinatorial issue of achieving equitable performance across clients in federated learning holds significant importance.

* The authors compared with multiple baselines and considered settings with adversarial attacks.

### Weaknesses
* The proposed algorithm is complicated and lacks formal convergence guarantees, so it's hard to understand and confidence in the algorithm's behaviour and optimality of the produced global model. 
* It would be beneficial to have some guidance or a more systematic approach to determine the values of $\epsilon_b$, $\epsilon_{ub}$ and $\epsilon_{ul}$.
* The proposed problem and algorithms assume a binary target variable which is rather restrictive.
* The algorithm requires full client participation and allows for a single local epoch, increasing the communication overhead (as also shown in Figure 3) and restricting the applicability of EFFL in large-scale FL applications. 
 * The experiments were conducted on only 2 real datasets and considered very few clients (maximum 11 for the eICU dataset).

### Questions
* How to determine the values of $\epsilon_b$ $\epsilon_{ub}$ and $\epsilon_{ul}$? There is some study on the effects of Appendix B.4.2, but I am unsure whether these results can be generalized given it was only examined for a single dataset that uses 2 clients.
 * Can the spaces required by the EFFL algorithm be infeasible? (e.g., the decision space $\mathcal{H}_B\cap\mathcal{H}_E$ defined by the fairness and bias constraints)
 * Are there any assumptions on the smoothness and convexity of the hypothesis class and the local loss functions to get the final objective? 
* How well does this approach scale with a large number of clients? It would be interesting to see what EFFL's performance on the fe.g., on ACS Employment dataset, which naturally exhibits non-iid characteristics, being partitioned into 51 regions (that can act as separate clients).


**Minor:**
* what does the following sentence mean in the context of FL: "Previous work overlooks the trade-offs in achieving equality from a social welfare perspective and local optimality from an individual beneficial perspective"?
