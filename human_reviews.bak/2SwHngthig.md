## Abstract
Opponent modeling aims at learning the opponent's behaviors, goals, or beliefs to reduce the uncertainty of the competitive environment and assist decision-making. Existing work has mostly focused on learning opponent models online, which is impractical and inefficient in practical scenarios. To this end, we formalize an Offline Opponent Modeling (OOM) problem with the objective of utilizing pre-collected offline datasets to learn opponent models that characterize the opponent from the viewpoint of the controlled agent, which aids in adapting to the unknown fixed policies of the opponent. Drawing on the promises of the Transformers for decision-making, we introduce a general approach, Transformer Against Opponent (TAO), for OOM. Essentially, TAO tackles the problem by harnessing the full potential of the supervised pre-trained Transformers' in-context learning capabilities. The foundation of TAO lies in three stages: an innovative offline policy embedding learning stage, an offline opponent-aware response policy training stage, and a deployment stage for opponent adaptation with in-context learning. Theoretical analysis establishes TAO's equivalence to Bayesian posterior sampling in opponent modeling and guarantees TAO's convergence in opponent policy recognition. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on competitive environments with sparse and dense rewards demonstrate the impressive performance of TAO. Our approach manifests remarkable prowess for fast adaptation, especially in the face of unseen opponent policies, confirming its in-context learning potency.

### Summary
This work investigates the problem of rapid adaptation to an unknown opponent policy. The proposed approach is to learn a latent opponent model and play the response to the currently predicted opponent. They developed this under the namesake TAO (Transformers Against Opponent), a sequential application of three existing methods (learning policy embeddings, computing responses to known opponents, and few-shot adaptation). TAO is evaluated in the Markov Soccer and Multiagent Particle games and tends to perform at least as well as an existing method.

### Strengths
- I view the main effort of this work as addressing the question "Can transformers solve the few-shot opponent adaptation problem?" To which, it appears the answer is yes, at least as well as existing approaches.
- The related work is extensive, especially when it considers different methods of opponent modeling. It is also worth noting that ad-hoc teamwork is a relevant literature area despite focusing on common-interest/team games. 
- The implementation details of both their methods and their versions of the baseline methods are extensively detailed in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
- The major weakness of this work is the lack of precision in the discussion of their empirical results. In each experiment, the authors skip straight to making a concluding remark after describing their experimental method. A discussion of the results, beyond "see Fig X" is required and why the provided evidence leads to the resulting conclusion. In general, I also found the claims to be too strong for the provided figures. 
- This work redefines the notion of "offline opponent modeling" and expands its problem description to also include adaptation. I think this redefinition confuses more than aids in clarifying the problem space. I would strongly recommend against this redefinition. I think this also causes this paper to feel like it's trying to do too much and then only do a cursory treatment of each problem (modeling and adaptation). I think the paper would have been stronger if the authors focused on these problems independently and then together.
- It's not clear to me what is added to our understanding of this problem from using transformers and "in-context learning" --- a vogue rebranding of concepts like correlation devices. I was hoping the authors could comment on their vision of this research, beyond that transformers are a neural network architecture that previous methods cannot readily apply.


**Minor (Not Effecting Score)**
- The language in the paper at times feels very unnatural (uncanny ChatGPT-esque), and I personally found it hard to read.
- In the figures "# Opponent Policy" --> "# Opponent Policies".

### Questions
- Sec 3.1, "Specifically Tk1 ... usually with certain noise." The notation is a touch confusing here wrt your datasets. Does this mean that you only consider datasets where each player plays the same policy? If so, why?
- Sec 4.2, how do you control for the ego agent's influence on the trajectory? 
  - It's not clear to me what these "fragments" are, why you're taking them, and why it's sensible to stitch together what appears to be sub-trajectories from differing episodes. 
  - I would have liked to see baselines/ablations related to their opponent-modeling proposal.
- Sec 4.4, why are the differences in optimality guarantees not directly stated in the paper?
  - What is it about TAO that enables the improvement in results? 
  - It's not clear to me that TAO should beget any improvements, so is it proof of a stronger bound?
- Sec 5.1, "We adopt three kinds of test settings for Π test, where seen is equivalent to the offline opponent policy set Π off, unseen contains some previously unseen opponent policies, and mix is a mixture of the former two." It appears _unseen_ and _mix_ are redundant and contain only different partitions of held-in and held-out policies. 
  - Why not also test generalizations to strictly held-out policies? 
  - How were the ordering of policies selected for the adaptation experiments? 
- Figure 4 has a non-standard y scale. Why are all the BR performances so bad against the subset of opponents that necessitated expanding the low-performance bracket? This smells like there is an issue in the quality/diversity of the opponent population because there are only extremely high and low-scoring performances.
- Sec 5.2, Question 1
  - "TAO consistently outperforms other baselines ... this implies that TAO can respond effectively to unseen ..." No evidence supporting this claim, and it is exceptionally strong. At best, the authors can claim that it performs better than baseline methods. 
  - Suggest also computing best responses directly to each opponent independently. This allows some measurement of what BR performance actually is, so we can have a better estimate of how much of true BR performance is recovered and how quickly. 
  - In Figure~4, while it is true that TAO looks like it's performing well, I don't think there's any clear narrative here. It's losing to other methods sometimes, often draws with many other methods, and the variance is exceptionally large. Indicates the need for additional study as to when each method is effective. 
  - How are you measuring "strong adaptability ... swiftly adjusting"?
  - Fig 3 (b) is not explained ever and I'm not sure what it's trying to say. 
- Sec 5.2, Question 2
  - It's not clear to me how a tSNE embedding is sufficient to show "ability to recognize". I would expect a clear quantitive result here.
  - One such way to do this would be to look at the similarity of the embeddings of known opponent trajectories compared to circumstances where the agent has varying degrees of information inaccuracy. For example, it's previous episodic context could be from a different opponent. Another option is to measure the clustering of the embeddings. Or one could consider training a classifier on the frozen embeddings to see how well it could classify their originating opponent policy.
  - Moreover, the authors need to supply similarity comparisons of their opponent policies.
    - From investigating their description in the appendix I'm actually surprised they're not overlaping in tSNE space. Some are very similar! 
    - An explanation for this could be that the game is just very easy and each opponent policy defines nearly unique state spaces (after the initial few steps). Any performance differences could be attributed to that method/BR being poorly trained in that specific game state.
- Sec 5.2, Question 3
  - "This suggests that PEL .... robust in-context learning abilities" No evidence offered to support that PEL offers exactly "more robust in-context learning abilities".
  - Should mention whether these results match previous work and discuss their (ag/disag)reement. This experiment appears to me to be largely a reproducibility experiment of a known method for policy representation learning.
- I would have preferred if the authors had ablated the various three components of TAO. Did the authors investigate these?
- For Figure 3 and 6 could you account for the performance difference between the subplots and why it appears that in 3(b), 4, and 6(b) the error is often much higher than seen in any bar charts of tables.
- Perhaps the most interesting result, to me, is that of Question 7 in the appendix. Where you see evidence that larger context lengths can further confuse TAO as their is further uncertainty as to what evidence should be considered. I was wondering if the authors could speak more on this and how they think this could be addressed?

### Summary
This work studies the offline opponent modeling problem. To tackle this problem, the authors first use a policy embedding learning process to learn the embedding of opponent policies. This process adopts a generative loss to imitate opponents and a discriminative loss to discern different opponent policies. Next, the authors introduce a decoder that conditions the opponent policy embedding and the controlled agent's trajectory and outputs the agent's action. Through the supervised training based on offline data, the decoder learns to respond to the opponent policy given the policy embedding. After deployment, the proposed method collects the latest trajectories of opponents, generates corresponding embeddings, and samples the actions that adapt to the current opponent policy.

### Strengths
1. This paper is organized well and written clearly.

2. The authors perform extensive experiments and use various settings to support their claims.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical contribution of this paper is not very impressive. The main working flow of the proposed method is an integration of existing works and does not provide new insights.

2. The authors miss some works that should be compared with.

3. The environments used in the experiments are quite simple.

Please see more discussions in the following Questions section.

### Questions
1. In section 4.2, the function GetOffD begins by sampling $C$ trajectories from $\tau^{-1,k}$, following which it samples $H$ consecutive
fragments from each trajectory and ultimately stitches them together. The reason for this design should be explained more clearly. Specifically, during deployment (section 4.3), the method collects the latest $C$ trajectories which are reasonable. However, during the training, the sampled $C$ trajectories are often from different periods which may not be very related to $y_t$ and $a_t$. Why this would help with the training?

2. In experiments, the authors mention "previously unseen opponent policies". How to define "unseen"? Is it possible that an unseen policy is similar to a certain seen policy?

3. Why the win rate can have a negative value?

4. Some compared works are out-dated, e.g., He et al., 2016a. Why not compare with Zintgraf et al., 2021 mentioned in the related work section. In addition, there exist some related works which could be compared with. For example,

-- Rahman, Muhammad A., et al. "Towards open ad hoc teamwork using graph-based policy learning." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2021.

-- Zhang, Ziqian, et al. "Fast Teammate Adaptation in the Presence of Sudden Policy Change." UAI 2023.

-- Zhu, Zhengbang, et al. "MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models." arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.17330 (2023).

All these works model agents' policy and they claim their method can adapt to different agent policies. I understand that their scenarios are cooperative systems. However, their methods are comparatively straightforward to adapt to the setting of this paper.

5. The environments used for evaluation are very simple. Is it possible to conduct experiments in more complex domains?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new setting for the opponent modeling problem (OOM) where environment and opponent policies are unavailable. Under this setting, the authors introduce a novel model, named Transformer Against Opponent (TAO). TAO adopts Transformer’s capabilities on sequence modeling and in-context learning to learn discriminative policy embedding and predict response actions. The authors provide a theoretical analysis that establishes TAO's equivalence to Bayesian posterior sampling in opponent modeling and guarantees TAO's convergence in opponent policy recognition. The paper also includes empirical analysis to demonstrate TAO's effectiveness in achieving competitive results against other approaches for the OOM problem.

### Strengths
1. The paper is overall well-structured and easy to follow. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the problem they are addressing and the existing work in the field. 

2. The new setting of learning opponents offline seems reasonable to me. And the idea of modeling opponent policies as an in-context learning problem is interesting. 

3. Experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of TAO on the OOM problem.

### Weaknesses
My concerns mainly lie in the experiment section.

-	The authors should give a more detailed description of the constructed datasets which are the key points of this paper.

-	For the mix type, what is the proportion of the number of the opponent policies between seen and unseen? How do the models, including TAO and baselines, perform on different proportions?

-	What’s the meaning of “# of opponent policy” in Fig 3b and Fig 6b? Does it stand for the number of policy items or the number of policy types, for seen or unseen or total? From the results in Fig 3b and Fig 6b, in the PA dataset, the model's performance exhibits a noticeable trend of initially improving and then declining under different number of opponent policies. However, in the MS dataset, while the model's performance fluctuates, there is no clear trend. Why is there such a difference and what causes this performance variation?

-	The authors should also provide a visualization of unseen policies in Fig 5a to make the demonstration more convincing.

Minor issue:

### Questions
-	Does GPT2 stay frozen or get fine-tuned in policy embedding learning?

-	Under the setting of OOM, no opponent policy should be available for learning except for trajectory sampling. Does the discriminative loss cause policy label exposure to the model and violate the setting?

### Summary
This paper proposes an offline RL method specifically for domains with other agents.
The method consists of a transformer model that is used to encode the opponent trajectory (called opponent policy embedding, OPE) in some latent space and a transformer that, with this encoding as input, is trained to predict the best action through behavioral cloning (called in-context control decoder, ICD).

OPE is trained with two (additive) losses of which one is based on the likelihood of the predictions over the opponent policy and the other on a discriminative loss over the trajectory index.
ICD is trained on, as far as I can tell, the typical behavioral cloning loss (likelihood of predicting the action take in the offline data set).

### Strengths
This paper tackles a difficult problem, that of adapting quickly to (sometimes unseen) opponents.
It does so with an arguably scalable approach (e.g. with transformers) that can be deployed online is a real-time manner by pre-computing the heavy work that many algorithms do online instead (to infer their opponents policy).

The solution, additionally, proposes a significant amount of clever and proper uses of existing techniques to tackle the many obstacles that come with a complex problem like theirs.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is on the lack of clarity and theoretical rigor in this paper.
Additionally, while there was motivation for the problem setup and high-level design choices, most of the proposed method lacked description or reasoning.

For example, a common occurrence in the paper is the mathematical description of a loss used with barely any description of what it achieves (I *believe* equation 5 is typical behavioral cloning; supervised learning on the action in the data set, but I had to infer this), often including cryptic terms as "GetOnD" which "samples fragments from each trajectory of W and then stitches them together".
It was sometimes unclear what even the intended task was of a particular component in the model and necessary to reverse engineer it from the proposed solution.

Lack of rigor is especially visible in the theoretical analysis where the first theorem reads as "assume that (...) M is (...), then <statement>" but (I assume) the notation is such that <statement> does not even mention "M", making it unclear why that assumptions affects the statement at all to begin with.
The second theorem states their method has "better optimally guarantees" but does not mention what "better" means in this context.

As a result this paper reads as a recipe for training a particular model to solve their a problem setting of which the generality is difficult to judge.
This is to the detriment of the paper because, despite theirr focus on opponent modeling, I would not be surprised if (with some notation/generality) adjustments this could just as easily be applied to any (non-opponent) meta-learning tasks.

### Questions
In what way, during execution, do we assume that the agent has access to the opponent trajectory?
