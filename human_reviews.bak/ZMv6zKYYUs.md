- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
Recent advances in the theory of Neural Operators (NOs) have enabled fast and accurate computation of the solutions to complex systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their great success, current NO-based solutions face important challenges when dealing with spatio-temporal PDEs over long time scales. Specifically, the current theory of NOs does not present a systematic framework to perform data assimilation and efficiently correct the evolution of PDE solutions over time based on sparsely sampled noisy measurements. In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear PDEs. Exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces, we develop a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. The proposed framework is capable of producing fast and accurate predictions over long time horizons, dealing with irregularly sampled noisy measurements to correct the solution, and benefits from the decoupling between the spatial and temporal dynamics of this class of PDEs. We show through experiments on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes and Korteweg-de Vries equations that the proposed model is robust to noise and can leverage arbitrary amounts of measurements to correct its prediction over a long time horizon with little computational overhead.

### Summary
The paper proposes the NODA method for learning semilinear neural operators that aloows both prediction and data assimilation. The method is motivated by the observer operator gain in [1], by which the evolution of the estimates are designed to consist of two terms, one for prediction and one for correction. Experiments on  the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, NS, and Korteweg-de Vries equations are conducted to demonstrate the performance.

### Strengths
- The motivation is clear and applying data assimilation to neural operator learning is very relevant.
- The paper is well-written and easy-to-follow. The derivation of the method is intriguing.
- The integration of the observer design of semilinear PDEs seems novel.
- Strong experimental results.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of explanation of the observer design of semilinear PDEs. On page 5, the authors claim that under “mild” additional conditions, the solution converges to that of the real solution. In the experiments, the measurements are obtained by injecting Gaussian noises to the real solutions. It might be beneficial to provide some details of the claim so that readers may learn about in which data assimilation scenario this framework may fit.
- While the adoption of the FNO architecture is reasonable for the prediction term, it is not clear why the observer gain $K$ should/ are sufficient to be parametrized as in (15). A further explanation of the intuition here might be necessary.
- As for the experiments, it seems only the proposed NODA method needs a warmup. While I totally understand the methodology here and the need for the warmup, I just wonder if this would cause unfair comparison with other methods that have no access to this part of the data and thus less strong performance.
- It might be better to include colorbars for all the figures, not only for one in Figure 5.

### Summary
Acknowledging the recent limitations in current Neural Operators, namely, data assimilation and lack of forecast error correction, authors propose learning semilinear operators instead, for which a body of mathematics literature exists already and allows for data assimilation and error correction through the use of the *observer* operator. Another feature of this framework is the fact that it assumes that the measurements are inherently noisy and also assumes in general that the dynamics themselves could be noisy. The authors base their architectural design on the semilinear operator by proposing a time-discretization that they later parametrize using Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). An essential facet of their research lies in their emphasis on learning correction operators, and this is substantiated by comprehensive ablation studies that illustrate their efficacy. In summary, the method presented in this work yields notably robust outcomes, particularly in the context of the considered datasets.

The first weakness that I pointed to in the weakness section is a huge one in my opinion and is reflected in my score. I am ready to change my score if that weakness is addressed since I think it will make the whole paper much better.

### Strengths
- Well-written paper and method is well motivated with respect to the literature.
- Considers the snapshots as inherently noisy instead of assuming their ground-truth nature.
- Proposed framework is baked in sound mathematical theory which is reflected in the design choice of the architecture, furthemore, it proposes a way of mitigating the long-standing challenge of long-term forecast error.
- Proposed framework beats the baselines when $\alpha=0$ suggesting that even in the prediction-only phase (Tables 1, 2 and 4), the architecture is well justified. Moreover, the authors demonstrate the soundness of the correction operator through (Table 3, Figures 3 and 4) in which they show that the error decreases as more updates steps are considered.

### Weaknesses
- Unclear how Eq. 12 was derived. I tried going through the effort of deriving it myself but couldn't get the same results, so it's critical that this step is justified (you can include the proof in the appendix if it burdens the main text) but a proof must be provided since the whole method is based on it.
- This is a "weak" weakness but given that the setting considered in the paper is that of $y(t)$ being just noise added to $z(t)$, it seems perhaps too much trying to learn a linear operator ($I_d$ in this case) using a non-linear neural net. While I understand that this was done to accomodate general case scenarios, it would be nice to see some ablation experiments showing the superiority of using a neural net for learning the operator $C$ as compared to using either: A learnable projection matrix or using not learning it at all and assuming $C=I_d$. Also, having an additional dataset where $C$ is not trivial could help motivate the choice of the architecture for it.
- In the main text and the paper from Afshar et al. (2022), The *observer gain* $K(t)$ needs to satisfy the condition that in the absence of noise from the system dynamics $z(t)$ and noise from the measurements $y(t)$, $\hat{z}(t)\rightarrow z(t)$, yet nothing is said about that when the architecture for it was introduced in Eq. 15. Perhaps a pretraining period where no noise is introduced in the samples could be used to make sure that the learned $K$ satisfies the aforementioned condition (at least approximately) and then finetuning further using your training scheme.

### Questions
- Is it possible to have a clear demonstration of why Navier-Stokes and KdV equations are semi-linear PDEs?

### Summary
The paper presents NODA, a novel means of solving a particular class of PDEs with Neural Operators.
By exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs, NODA benefits from increased accuracy on suitable tasks, and the important ability to incorporate noisy data to assist in making its predictions. Experiments are run on two different PDEs, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes, in one and two spatial dimensions respectively.

### Strengths
Originality: NODA is, to the best of my knowledge, a highly novel approach to leveraging the structure of semilinear PDEs to create more powerful Neural Operators. 

Motivation: The authors make a strong case for NODA's theoretical motivation, by leveraging the structure of semilinear PDEs, and introducing an interesting prediction/correction mechanism.

Clarity: The paper is well written, with a clear exposition of the concepts and methodology.

Significance: This is certainly a highly impactful area of machine learning, one which could lead to improvements in the speed and accuracy of predicting complex dynamical systems.

### Weaknesses
- The abstract claims that the proposed method makes fast predictions, and has “little computational overhead”. Yet no experimental evidence is provided to support this statement. It’s important the authors rectify this by including quantitative timing metrics for the experiments, and compare it against the other methods presented.

- The selection of experiments is very limited – only looking at one 1D and one 2D PDE. It would be advisable to at least present results for more than one Reynolds number.

- The  experimental results are well presented, but the tables lack uncertainty estimates. The reader is therefore left unable to gauge whether the performance differences between different methods are statistically significant.

- While there are a good number of alternative methods in the benchmarks, I’m not sure they were the most appropriate choices. The two LSTM-based models are taken from papers that are over eight years old. Meanwhile the MNO is specifically designed for dissipative dynamics, yet the Navier-Stokes experiment is chosen to be in the non-dissipative regime. Furthermore, none of the other methods selected for benchmarking are able to make use of the noisy data, so we are unable to test the key feature of NODA. Alternative works which may offer more suitable benchmarks include ‘Approximate Bayesian Neural Operators’ and ‘Multiwavelet-based Operator Learning for Differential Equations’.

### Questions
My suggestions are linked to the weaknesses highlighted above:

- Including timings for the experiments, to show how fast the algorithm is compared to competing methods. 

- To introduce more variety in the experiments. Would it be impractical to explore higher Reynolds numbers, and do we expect NODA to cope less well with turbulent flow?

- I imagine the uncertainties in the numerical experiments are quite small but it would still be a strong recommendation to include them.

- Either some justification needs to be added for the particular choices of the benchmark methods, or more suitable alternatives should be introduced in their place.

- Figures 1 and 2 are lacking a colour scale, making it challenging for the reader to assess the nature of the uncertainties. The reader is left to guess values based upon the Table but it would be preferable to be explicit and quantitative. 

Overall I would stress that I think the paper is very promising, so I hope these suggestions help the authors to address my concerns.
