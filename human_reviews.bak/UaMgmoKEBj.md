## Abstract
Regularized reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the entropy-regularized kind, has gained traction in optimal control and inverse RL. While standard unregularized RL methods remain unaffected by changes in the number of actions, we show that it can severely impact their regularized counterparts. This paper demonstrates the importance of decoupling the regularizer from the action space: that is, to maintain a consistent level of regularization regardless of how many actions are involved to avoid over-regularization. Whereas the problem can be avoided by introducing a task-specific temperature parameter, it is often undesirable and cannot solve the problem when action spaces are state-dependent. In the state-dependent action context, different states with varying action spaces are regularized inconsistently. We introduce two solutions: a static temperature selection approach and a dynamic counterpart, universally applicable where this problem arises. Implementing these changes improves performance on the DeepMind control suite in static and dynamic temperature regimes and a biological design task.

### Summary
This work reveals the problem that the regularization effect can be severely affected by the number of actions (especially when action spaces are state-dependent) in regularized reinforcement learning. Starting with two motivating examples, this paper introduces decoupled regularizers whose range is constant over action spaces. The authors further prove that the range of a general class of standard regularizers grows with the number of actions. Two solutions of temperature selection, static v.s., dynamic, are proposed based on which practical algorithms can be implemented. The proposed solutions are evaluated in toy examples, DMC and drug design environments with SQL, SAC and GFN as backbones and baselines. The results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

### Strengths
- The paper is overall well organized and written. Illustrative examples and discussions are used for smooth reading.
- The proposed solutions to decoupling regularization and temperature adjustment are of generality to a family of commonly seen regularizations.
- The experiments cover toy examples, popular DMC environments and drug design problem. Noticeably, unprecedented results in the domain of drug design are achieved.

### Weaknesses
- I think the key hyperparameter $\alpha$ needs more discussion. It will be helpful to analyze the (empirical) effects of different choices of the value of $\alpha$ and recommend the values or the strategy of value selection.
- The content in the experiment part lacks of sufficient details, which is also missing in the appendix. I recommend the authors to add the key details of experiments.

### Questions
1) Is it possible to have some case-analysis for the results of DMC (e.g., in Figure 3,4)? For example, the proposed method achieves significantly better performance in tasks like BallInCupCatch, FingerTurnHard, HopperStand while the baseline fails totally.

2) Which is the type of temperature setting adopted for the experiments in Section 8.3, i.e., fixed temperature or dynamic temperature?

&nbsp;

Minor:
- It seems that the coefficients $\gamma$ and $\tau$ are missing for the entropy term in Equation 3a.

### Summary
This paper focuses on regularized reinforcement learning, where the objective is to find a policy in an MDP which maximizes the reward minus a weighted regularization term—most commonly the negative entropy. The authors argue that the weight of the regularization term should vary depending on the environment and even sometimes based on the specific state, since the range of values the regularizer can take might depend heavily on the action space. To solve this problem, the authors introduce a method for dynamically setting the regularization coefficient based on the maximum and minimum values the regularizer can take at a particular state. They show that this can improve RL performance compared to using the same coefficient across environments.

### Strengths
As the authors note, regularized RL is widely applicable in both control and IRL, so improving its sensitivity to hyperparameters could be helpful for a variety of applications. The experimental results show that the proposed method for setting the regularization coefficient seems to work quite well in practice, particularly when the action space does not have a standard scale.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is promising, I worry that in it's current form it is not ready for publication at a top conference. First, the contribution is relatively small, since it is already known how to choose the entropy coefficient for many environments (e.g., via the SAC rule of using $\bar{H}=-n$) and it often needs to be tuned regardless depending on the scale of the reward function. While I still think the ideas here are useful, the writing, theory, and experiments should be of very high quality to justify publication.

However, I found the paper to be often unclear and imprecise, making it difficult to read. See the list of issues below for a partial list of the problems I noticed. The fact that many claims are unprecise and thus actually incorrect as stated makes it difficult to know which contributions to trust.

One possible extension to this work that could increase the contribution of the paper is to also include regularization to a base policy, as is often done in RLHF for LLMs via a KL divergence regularization term (e.g., see Bai et al., "Training a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback"). There have been various papers attempting to find a systematic way of setting the regularization coefficient (e.g., the above paper and Gao et al., "Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overparameterization"), but none have considered possible setting the coefficient differently at different states, so this could be an interesting direction to apply the ideas presented in this paper.

Also, a relevant paper is "LESS is More: Rethinking Probabilistic Models of Human Behavior" by Bobu et al. They approach the problem from the motivation of modeling human behavior, which under the "Boltzmann rational" model is equivalent to solving a regularized MDP. They have a different approach to solving the issue of how the number of actions or number of trajectories that can achieve a particular reward affects the optimal regularized solution. It would be good to compare the approach in this paper with theirs.

**Issues with clarity and precision:**
 * The first paragraph of the intro argues "changing the action space should not change the optimal policy." This is true in most cases—the issue is that "changing the action space should not change the optimal *entropy-regularized* policy." I think it's important to make this distinction since otherwise it sounds wrong.
 * In Section 2, it is not specified that the MDPs considered have discrete actions, although it later appears this is an unspoken assumption. Then later, the paper switches to continuous MDPs without any explicit distinction.
 * In Section 2, according to the formalism in Geist et al., $\Omega$ should really be a function of only $\pi(s)$, not of $\pi$ in general.
 * In Section 2, the first time regularization is introduced it's with $\tau \Omega(\pi)$ subtracted from the value function; then immediately below it's instead added to the value function.
 * The definition of $\Omega^*_\tau$ is unclear.
 * Proof of Lemma 1: this proof seems insufficient; why exactly does convexity imply any other point must be smaller?
 * In SAC, the entropy is actually calculated before applying $\tanh$ to squash the actions into the action space. This means that the entropy is unbounded, and thus the idea in this paper does not apply directly.

**Typos:**
 * Proof of Lemma 1: "supermum" -> "supremum"
 * Section 3 title: "graviation" -> "gravitation"

### Questions
* Why should the ideas in this paper apply to SAC when the entropy as measured in SAC is actually unbounded?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method of regularization of common RL algorithms. First, the paper proves that standard regularization techniques used in RL algorithms such as SQL and SAC suffer from regularization that behaves differently with the size of the action space. The authors propose a new family of regularization techniques where state-dependent temperature parameters are learned by normalizing by the range of regularization function. The authors also show that such normalization can also be used on regularization techniques that dynamically learn the temperature parameter. Finally, the authors demonstrate their results on a variety of domains, including DM env and drug discovery.

### Strengths
1. The paper motivates the problem with standard regularization techniques well in Section 2-5. 

2. The empirical results are quite compelling. The proposed method, while simple, succeeds in various DM env tasks where standard methods fail. More convincingly, the proposed method allows SQL to succeed on a drug discovery task, whereas prior attempts were known to be too unstable.

### Weaknesses
1. The method proposed in the paper is very simple, and involves normalizing the standard temperature by the range the regularization objective can take (e.g. minimum possible entropy). While I do not think that the simplicity of the approach should detract from the novelty of the paper, I am not convinced that the better experimental results are actually due to the proposed range-normalization, and not simply that the regularization can now be state-dependent. To my knowledge, state-dependent temperatures is not itself a novel concept, as other works have tried to dynamically set temperature based on state [1, 2]. The results would be more convincing if the authors showed that prior efforts in state-dependent regularization fail whereas theirs succeeds.

2. The algorithm does not actually circumvent the extensive hyperparameter tuning required by existing RL algorithms. It is unclear how sensitive the proposed approach is to various settings of temperature and \alpha.

### Questions
1. The empirical results swap between dynamic and static learning of the temperature parameter. Is there a reason why one of the method works better for a particular domain. Specifically, will dynamic temperature learning at least reproduce the results of using a static temperature in the drug discovery experiment?
