# Compress, Then Prompt: Improving Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off of LLM Inference with Transferable Prompt

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
While the numerous parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute to their superior performance, this massive scale makes them inefficient and memory-hungry. Thus, they are hard to deploy on the commodity hardware, such as one single GPU.
Given the memory and power constraints of such devices, model compression methods are widely employed to reduce the model size and inference latency, which essentially trades off model quality in return for improved efficiency.
Thus, optimizing this accuracy-efficiency trade-off is crucial for the LLM deployment on commodity hardware.
In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to optimize this trade-off by prompting compressed models.
Specifically, we first observe that for certain questions, the generation quality of a compressed LLM can be significantly improved by adding carefully designed hard prompts, though this isn't the case for all questions.
Based on this observation, we propose a soft prompt learning method where we expose the compressed model to the prompt learning process, aiming to enhance the performance of prompts.
Our experimental analysis suggests our soft prompt strategy greatly improves the performance of the $8\times$ compressed Llama-7B model (with a joint 4-bit quantization and 50\% weight pruning compression), allowing them to match their uncompressed counterparts on popular benchmarks.
Moreover, we demonstrate that these learned prompts can be transferred across various datasets, tasks, and compression levels.
Hence with this transferability, we can stitch the soft prompt to a newly compressed model to improve the test-time accuracy in an ``in-situ'' way.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors first identify the efficiency problems with the inference process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Then, the authors find that quantization and pruning are utilized to deal with the efficiency problem while incurring performance issues, i.e., the PPL of the model is high. Then, the authors propose a soft prompt approach to improve the performance of the quantized or pruned model. In addition, the authors validate three aspects of the proposed methods, i.e., cross dataset transferability, cross compression transferability, and cross-task transferability.

### Strengths
1. The approach of soft prompt to address the performance of the quantized or pruned LLM is effective.
2. The analysis of the three aspects of the proposed approach is interesting.
3. The paper is well organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The approach is simple and the novelty is not obvious. The soft prompt method is already proposed in multiple existing papers.
2. The evaluation is only conducted with PPL. However, the evaluation of LLM should be well designed and other methods should be exploited to further validate the proposed method.
3. More tasks should be examined to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Questions
1. I wonder if there are other LLM evaluation methods besides PPL.
2. I wonder it the method can be applied to other tasks, e.g., captioning.
3. I wonder what would be the difference between the proposed methods and conventional soft prompt tuning except using different LLMs, i.e., one with quantized or pruned model while the other one with the original model.

### Summary
In order to restore the performance of compressed models (either quantized or weight sparsified, or both), this paper applies prefix tuning on compressed models, and studies whether a prefix decided on one dataset, one compression rate, or one task can generalize to others. This paper experiments on compressed OPT (1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B) and LLaMA (7B) models, using C4, Wikitext-2, and Penn Treebank for perplexity evaluation, and OpenbookQA, Hellaswag, PIQA, and HSEH for zero-shot accuracy evaluation.

### Strengths
* The research question of how to make LLMs smaller and maintain their performance is very important.
* Tuning the prompt prefix is a reasonable way to help with that.
* The paper has empirically studied the transferability of the learned prefix to other compression rates and datasets.

### Weaknesses
* Novelty is limited. The literature has applied the soft prefix tuning method to uncompressed models, and this paper applies the soft prefix tuning method to a compressed model. It's like a verification scenario of the prefix tuning method.
* Experimental verification needs to be improved: 
  - Experiments are only conducted on small and relatively old models (4 OPT and LLaMA-v1, all <7B).
  - Do not compare with other strategies of finetuning in model compression, e.g., how about we apply LoRA tuning to restore the performance of model compression?

## Minor
* There are some minor writing issues, need some proofreading:
  - Unify “PPL” and “Perplexity” in Figure 2.
  - No caption for Figure 6.
  - One result is wrongly colored in Table 5. 50% row, HSEH column.

### Questions
* Can the prompt prefix generalize across different models?

### Summary
This paper presents an interesting prompt engineering observation about efficient LLMs. Performance improves by adding a hard-coded prompt telling the LLM to reconsider its solution because it is compressed! The authors build on that observation by performing _transferable_ prompt tuning on a number of compressed (quantized/pruned) LLMs from the OPT/LLAMA family of models.

### Strengths
The main benefit claimed by the authors is that the tuned prompts are domain-agnostic. That is, they can be used on different models, datasets, or tasks quite easily because they are related to the fact that the model is compressed, not specifically-tuned for any specific domain.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses relate to a lack of wider context and evaluation of the presented method. For example: how expensive is prompt tuning? By creating transferable prompts, how much time/effort are we saving? How does accuracy compare to conventional prompt tuning (this is a key missing comparison). How does the presented method peform on other model families? (OPT and Llama are highly related).

Without comparison to other prompt tuning methods, it is hard to put the current results in the needed context.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Motivated by the ability to improve compressed LLM performance through human-engineered prompts (i.e., informing the LLM that it has been compressed), the authors formulate a prompt learning paradigm with the objective of recovering LLM performance lost due to compression/pruning. Additionally, this prompt learned via their method demonstrates transferability between datasets, compression schemes, and tasks. This research is ultimately motivated by the desire for portable, efficient, and accurate LLMs.

### Strengths
• Designed and implemented a prompt learning paradigm for improving performance of compressed LLMs through learned prompts.

• Prompt learning paradigm able to recover LLM performance when compared to original model on low and medium quantization/pruning settings. Performance with learned prompt is still better than without in all quantiation/pruning settings.

• Prompt learned for higher pruning/quantization rates is transferrable to lower pruning/quantization rates, respectively. Further, there are some instances where prompt is transferrable from pruning to quantization (or vice versa).

• Prompt learning demonstrated to be compatible with mixed pruned-quantized LLM.

### Weaknesses
• Very minor but presentation of some figures could be improved. Consider including baseline value (i.e., value of green line in Figures 2,3,4).

### Questions
I do not have any questions. The methodology and presentation was clear to me and the results were easy to interpret. I was going to ask about interpretation of the learned prompts but I found details on that in Appendix D.
