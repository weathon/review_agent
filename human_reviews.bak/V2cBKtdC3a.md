## Abstract
Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) for sequence-processing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offers certain conceptual advantages over backpropagation through time (BPTT). RTRL requires neither caching past activations nor truncating context, and enables online learning. However, RTRL's time and space complexity make it impractical. To overcome this problem, most recent work on RTRL focuses on approximation theories, while experiments are often limited to diagnostic settings. Here we explore the practical promise of RTRL in more realistic settings. We study actor-critic methods that combine RTRL and policy gradients, and test them in several subsets of DMLab-30, ProcGen, and Atari-2600 environments. On DMLab memory tasks, our system trained on fewer than 1.2B environmental frames is competitive with or outperforms well-known IMPALA and R2D2 baselines trained on 10B frames. To scale to such challenging tasks, we focus on certain well-known neural architectures with element-wise recurrence, allowing for tractable RTRL without approximation. Importantly, we also discuss rarely addressed limitations of RTRL in real-world applications, such as its complexity in the multi-layer case.

### Summary
The authors explore the practicality of RTRL as a method for learning in RNNs. In particular, the authors consider an RNN architecture whereby RTRL is relatively cheap to employ, and demonstrate its advantages over standard truncated BPTT on a range of reinforcement learning tasks.

### Strengths
- paper is generally well written
- though RTRL has now been around for some decades, its practical applications remain unclear. Towards this end the authors do offer interesting results which should be interesting to the broader ML community
- the RNN architecture based on element-wise application the authors use, though not novel itself, offers an interesting avenue for making RTRL more practical

### Weaknesses
- One concern I have is that the authors do not convincingly demonstrate the benefit of their model compared to the status quo, which is a fully connected RNN + truncated BPTT. In terms of complexity, the authors do reduce the memory/computational cost on pointwise RNNs to order N^2 which is certainly better than RTRL on standard RNNs, but this is still as expensive as BPTT on a fully connected RNN. In fact, for a pointwise RNN I wonder if BPTT is in fact of order N (as the forward pass?) - so still cheaper than RTRL - but I may be incorrect there. In terms of performance, the authors show that eLSTM + RTRL outperforms truncated BPTT on all RNN arhitectures for one task (watermaze) which is impressive, but I would have liked to seen this for more tasks; e.g. can RTRL outperform fully connected RNN + BPTT on any of the 5 Atari tasks in Fig 2?
- Related to the above, it is not clear whether online learning has any intrinsic benefits for performance. The authors note that online learning "allows for updating weights immediately after consuming very new input", but in practice the weights are only updated at the same rate as truncated BPTT (at rate M) to avoid 'sensitivity matrix staling'. I appreciate this is a difficult question to answer, and I believe this shortcoming is mentioned as the last presented limitation, but I think this deserves more direct clarification/exploration given the subject of this work.  
- All main results presented are with respect to performance in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, but what about supervised learning tasks? e.g. sequence modeling in language. The authors do use the 'copy task', which is a supervised learning task, as a diagnostic task, but I would have liked to see comparisons with BPTT for hard supervised learning tasks. Or at least a rational for only considering RL tasks
- The connection to biology and the 'memory' trace (e.g. Eqs 12-14) is interesting but not presently quite vague/weak. Some references to biological evidence for such traces (e.g. eligibility traces) would be advised.
- Given this is a paper which explores the practical/emperical outcomes of RTRL, I would advise a more thorough analysis of the ideal conditions for RTRL. For example, why do the authors believe RTRL is only valuable in some of the 5 Atari environments in Fig 2? For what types of task would RTRL be ill-advised? The space for technical description and equations in the main text is significant (e.g. equations 8-14) and in general I believe this should be in part sacrificed (to the Appendix) for more intepretability of the results.

### Questions
- The authors suggest that their work shows tractable RTRL in Quasi-RNN (Bradbury et al. 2017) and Simple Recurrent Units (Lei et al. 2018). I understand this for the latter, since as far as I understand the eLSTM is just a one-layer instance, but I don't understand this for Quasi-RNN. Doesn't this architecture use convolutions? Does that also mean that RTRL has a space/time complexity of N^2?
- The authors state that, "in practice, it is known that M > 1 is crucial (for TD learning of the critic) for optimal performance". Is this true? My belief was that one-step TD learning was frequently employed. Is there a relevant citation?
- How were the hyperparameters (Table 5) selected?
Typos: 
- Mozer (1989; 1991) already explore an RNN -> Mozer (1989; 1991) already explored/s an RNN
- several modern RNN architectures such Quasi-RNN -> several modern RNN architectures such as Quasi-RNN

### Summary
Real-time recurrent learning enables computing gradients in RNNs as the input sequence is processed. However, its complexity makes it impractical in realistic scenarios. In this work, the authors introduce a new version of the LSTM architecture for which RTRL is exact and cheap. They test the resulting algorithm in realistic RL tasks and show that it performs competitively to alternatives (TBPTT as well as approximations of RTRL on more standard LSTM architectures).

**After rebuttal**: After clarifications from the author, I would like to increase my score from 5 to 7. Given that 7 does not exist, I updated it to 6.

### Strengths
The paper studies in depth the known, yet underappreciated, fact that RTRL becomes much cheaper when recurrence is element-wise. The paper nicely cites early references containing similar insights. The empirical results show that it is better to change the architecture so that RTRL becomes exact, rather than approximating it to make it tractable.

### Weaknesses
I see three main weaknesses:

- Most of the experimental results (all except baseline comparison) seem to some extent obvious to me: the only difference between TBPTT to RTRL is an extended context length. It is thus not surprising that RTRL > TBPTT in all experiments. The context length for TBPTT is relatively short (it seems far smaller than the one modern GPUs would offer) so those experiments do not seem to answer the question:
    > In what scenarios would RTRL be able to replace BPTT in today’s deep learning?
    
    asked by the authors. Adding a baseline that uses as much context length as possible would help better contextualize the findings of the paper. To me, this is the main weakness of the paper, and fixing it may require substantial changes.
    
- The paper is missing a few relevant references:
    - Bellec et al. 2017: RTRL from a computational neuroscience perspective. One of the main contributions of the paper is to discuss how RTRL can be implemented biologically through eligibility traces.
    - Gupta et al. 2022: show that it is possible to parametrize some classes of linear RNNs (more precisely linear SSMs) diagonally, without losing too much performance. Orvieto et al. 2023, which is cited in this paper, build on this result.
    - Zucchet et al. 2023: show that spatial backpropagation combined with element-wise complex-valued recurrence enables learning multilayer networks with a performance close to the one of BPTT.
- The paper mentions the multilayer case as an important limitation but does not discuss any possible or existing solutions (layer-wise training of Javed et al. 2023 / spatial backpropagation of errors of Zucchet et al. 2023)

### Questions
The paper focuses on one layer, but mentions that multiple layers are key in deep learning. Would the experimental results presented here would benefit from RNNs with multiple layers? From the vision module being fine-tuned?

### Summary
This work studies RTRL method on element-wise recurrent neural networks, examined with the actor-critic policy gradient algorithm (R2AC) on reinforcement learning tasks. Although the eLSTM architecture was not first proposed by authors, the connection between element-wise recurrence and RTRL training was first pointed out. The eLSTM, RTRL and R2AC are examined together on several subsets of DMLab-30, ProcGen and Atari-2600 envrionments and outperforms the IMPALA and R2D2 baselines trained on 10B frames.

### Strengths
1. The study of RTRL on element-wise recurrence provides a clean examination condition to study the potential of RTRL learning algorithm. From the provided experimental results the RTRL outperforms TBPTT on eLSTM and other baselines on most of the tasks. 
2. Very clear writing, easy to follow. It is a big strength that the authors provided a thorough analysis of the limitations including multi-layer RTRL, the practicality of RTRL etc.

### Weaknesses
1. Only one element-wise RNN instantiation, namely the eLSTM was provided for comparison. It would be better to show the generality of the method on some other element-wise RNN instantiations.
2. The experiments are conducted on reinforcement learning tasks, which is fine as it is stated clearly as the study goal. However, it would be much more convincing if it is shown with certain supervised learning tasks.

### Questions
1. The variances shown in Figure 2 across different Atari environments are not consistent. For example, in Gravitar the variance for RTRL is larger than the other two and it’s the opposite in Seaquest. But overall it seems RTRL has a larger variance. Could the authors provide some explanation or intuition for that?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors explore the advantages of real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) compared to truncated BPTT in many reinforcement learning settings scoped to memory tasks. They use a variant of LSTM with element-wise recurrence in a singe layer to make RTRL tractable, and show that RTRL does have an advantage over truncated BPTT in these scenarios. They also provide a discussion of the difficulty of using RTRL in multi-layer recurrent networks.

### Strengths
While RTRL is known to be computationally intractable in the general case, there has not been much prior work in exploring if specific architectural choices can help make exact RTRL more feasible and useful. Especially given the potential advantages RTRL could have due to its computational requirements being independent of sequence length unlike many other sequence models. So this work is very timely and relevant to the community, and the use of element-wise recurrence to make exact RTRL feasible is novel to my knowledge. 

The authors demonstrate many tasks where RTRL with this architecture does better than truncated BPTT, which is very interesting given the very limited recurrence used. The discussion of multi-layer RTRL is also significant and useful to the community. Overall, the quality and clarity of the paper are high.

### Weaknesses
- The elementwise recurrence that the authors propose for eLSTM is very similar to that used in IndyLSTM [1], but a comparative discussion and citation is missing.
- Since exact RTRL computes exactly the same gradient as full BPTT, a specific analysis of why TBPTT rather than BPTT is used in each of the demonstrated tasks would be important to provide context (for e.g. in regards to memory requirements).
- A discussion/analysis of the computational expressivity of having restricted recurrent and its implications is missing.
- On a related note, a discussion (or even speculation) of why eLSTM works as well as it does given its limited recurrence would be useful.
- Certain combinations of baselines are missing: eLSTM with SnAP-1, full BPTT.
- The clarity of the experiments section could be improved. See below in "Questions".

### Questions
- Why does IMPALA with TBPTT+eLSTM do better than standard IMPALA (with LSTM+TBPTT presumably?)
- Is having a small value of M beneficial for RTRL in any other way? Not clear what the motivation for studying the effect of M is.

## Clarity:
- The specific tasks the authors test on is not described anywhere in the paper (the Appendix points to a webpage). Having this would help a lot with understanding the tasks used in the paper.
- The differences between the baseline methods of various variants of IMPALA and R2D2 are not sufficiently described.
