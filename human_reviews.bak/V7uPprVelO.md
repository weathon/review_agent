- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
The generation of diverse but realistic objects that have combinatorial properties has various practical applications across several fields, including computer graphics, animation, industrial design, material science, etc. For instance, we might want to restrict the output of the generator so that it satisfies discrete constraints or encourage certain combinatorial properties as a penalty. However, existing generative models and optimization solvers often struggle to concurrently ensure solution diversity and uphold the underlying combinatorial nature. To address this, we propose $GenCO$, a novel framework that conducts end-to-end training of deep generative models integrated with embedded combinatorial solvers, aiming to uncover high-quality solutions aligned with nonlinear objectives. While structurally akin to conventional generative models, $GenCO$ diverges in its role - it focuses on generating instances of combinatorial optimization problems rather than final objects (e.g., images). This shift allows finer control over the generated outputs, enabling assessments of their feasibility and introducing an additional combinatorial loss component. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of generative tasks characterized by combinatorial intricacies, including game level generation and map creation for path planning, consistently demonstrating its capability to yield diverse, high-quality solutions that reliably adhere to user-specified combinatorial properties.

### Summary
GenCO" is a novel framework that integrates deep generative models with combinatorial solvers to address design challenges that require diverse solutions while adhering to specific constraints. Unlike conventional generative models, GenCO focuses on generating instances of combinatorial optimization problems, allowing finer control over the generated outputs and introducing an additional combinatorial loss component. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated across various generative tasks, consistently producing diverse, high-quality solutions that meet user-defined combinatorial properties.

### Strengths
Combing the algorithmic prior of a combinatorial optimization solver with various generative models is an effective and promising approach.

### Weaknesses
The application methodology is relatively straightforward, involving the imposition of constraints or the assignment of optimization performance metrics to existing proposed methods, which are well-established techniques.

### Questions
1. How does this research address the mechanism behind generating diverse solutions when assigning combinatorial properties to various generative models, and does it simply rely on the use of generative models to claim diversity?

2. Combining GAN and VAE within a unified framework may seem unusual, given their distinct purposes. Is there a thoughtful consideration of the different objectives of these two generative models, or does it feel mechanically extended without such reflection?

3. Could you clearly define L_{Gen} for both VAE and GAN and provide separate descriptions for each in Figure 1? If the proposed learning method is more suitable for one of the generative models, focusing on it may be beneficial.

4. In section 3.2, regarding the Constrained Generator, are there any limitations in terms of the expressive power of linear projection? How does it differ from techniques like projected gradient ascent commonly used in constrained optimization?

5. In the penalized generator discussed in section 3.3, the idea of directly using the cost obtained through the combinatorial optimization solver h for model training has been present in prior research. Are there any novel aspects from a learning perspective in this new approach?

### Summary
The paper introduces GenCO, a framework to generate diverse and high-quality solutions that satisfy combinatorial constraints which is an important factor in design problems where both diversity of solutions and adherence to constraints are important. GenCO combines  the flexibility of deep generative models with the combinatorial efficiency of optimization solvers. This is achieved by introducing a "combinatorial loss" in addition to the regular generative loss. The combinatorial loss enforces hard constraints or add penalties for constraint violation. GenCO's involves generating a problem representation $c$. The combinatorial loss $C$ uses a MILP solver to project $c$ onto the feasible set (for hard constraints) or adds a penalty (for soft constraints). For hard constraints, the combinatorial loss is implemented via a projection that finds the closest feasible solution to $c$ allowing training of the generator without explicit constraints as the projection layer handles feasibility. For soft constraints, the combinatorial loss instead adds a penalty term based on constraint violation. The overall loss function balances the generative loss and combinatorial loss with a hyperparameter $\gamma$. For backpropagation through the combinatorial solver, differentiable MILP solvers are used. Empirical evaluations are presented on game level generation (with hard constraints) and map generation (with soft constraints on path planning efficiency). GenCO consistently generates more diverse and higher quality solutions than baselines.

### Strengths
* Ability to generate diverse, high-quality solutions satisfying combinatorial constraints is very useful for many design problems. This is a major strength of GenCO.

* As far as I can tell, this combination of deep generative models with combinatorial solvers is novel. It draws on the strengths of both approaches to solve a useful problem. 

* Experiments demonstrate clear improvements over baselines in diversity and quality of constrained generated objects. Though it should be noted that the baselines are not too strong. 

* The approach seems fairly general and can potentially be applied to many combinatorial generative tasks beyond the demonstrated applications, for instance molecular generation as discussed in the introduction.

### Weaknesses
* There is limited analysis of how the approach scales with problem size and constraint complexity. More extensive experiments on large and complex problems would be useful.

* The tradeoff between generative loss and combinatorial loss is not carefully analyzed. There is not enough details on how the parameter $\gamma$ is set and the impact it has on training.

* While backpropagation through combinatorial solvers is possible and works well in a lot of settings, it can be computationally expensive. Alternate approaches to incorporate solvers might be important for scalability.

* Theoretical analysis of GenCO's properties is limited. For instance, more analysis of convergence guarantees, sample complexity could strengthen the approach.

* It is not very clear to me how the method would generalize to general logical constraints, which can be important in the design scenarios considered. 

* Reproducibility: The authors do not include code to reproduce the results and experimental details are discussed but details about hyperparameter selection are missing.

### Questions
* Could you elaborate a bit on the scalability of the approach to complex constraints and problems? 

* Could you comment on how more general constraints could be incorporated in this framework?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the generative tasks in which both the diversity and conformity of constraints are crucial. The objective is to make the output of the generator follow discrete/combinatorial constraints and penalize any deviation. The proposed framework enables end-to-end training of deep generative models integrated with embedded combinatorial solvers, aiming to guarantee the combinatorial feasibility of the generation while also maintaining high fidelity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in generative tasks characterized by combinatorial intricacies, including game level generation and map creation for path planning, showing its superiority over previous peer methods.

### Strengths
1.$\ $The setup and task design studied in this article are intriguing and inspiring. In real-world scenarios, natural data often exhibit some discrete properties, which is an aspect overlooked in the realm of pure generative model research.

2.$\ $The paper is well organized and presented. The motivations and current challenges on top of the current techniques are clearly stated.

3.$\ $The methodology design is simple yet efficient. The empirical results are promising.

### Weaknesses
1.$\ $My primary concern regarding this paper is the selection of quantitative evaluation metrics. As a solution for generative tasks, the assessment of diversity and generation quality should draw from some classic evaluation metrics in the traditional generative model field, such as FID [1] and density/coverage [2]. While the evaluation method using a discriminator indeed holds some value, it is not an authoritative network, and this evaluation metric is single-dimensional in terms of discriminability, making its reliability less robust.

2.$\ $Some training details can be more specific. For instance, one aspect to consider is the stability and efficiency of the GAN training process. GANs are renowned for their challenging training dynamics, and the utilization of approximated gradients obtained through black-box optimization methods could potentially exacerbate the risk of training instability. Moreover, since the training data is limited, effectively training a GAN becomes a non-trivial endeavor.

### Questions
1.$\ $What about the quantitative evaluation results of traditional metrics in the generative model field such as FID and density/coverage?

2.$\ $"..., given that the levels are trained on only 50 examples, ...": How is the training dynamic of GAN with so limited data? Are there any additional efforts to stabilize training?

3.$\ $In the discussion of uniqueness in Sec. 4.1.2, it makes the adversary's task easier as it only needs to distinguish between valid discrete levels rather than continuous and unconstrained levels. But if the discriminator is too strong, it can easily lead to the phenomenon of gradient vanishing, does this make training even more challenging and unstable?

4.$\ $In fact, many generative tasks naturally exhibit certain discrete characteristics, but due to the strength of generative models, they can inherently learn these features. For example, generative models can learn that dogs have four legs. Is it possible that with a sufficiently powerful generative model, it can automatically recognize and learn these discrete features?

5.$\ $Typo: Sec. 4.2: descrbied -> described. Sec. 4.2.1: Delete "We then average the output to obtain the final loss for generator."

### Summary
This paper proposes GenCO that generates diverse solutions, instead of the best solution given by traditional solvers, for design poblems with combanitorial nature. Specifically, it deals with either hard or soft constraints by introducing  a combanitorial loss.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-motivated.
2. The results are good according to the case study, while more metrics are expected for better evaluation.

### Weaknesses
1. The so-called combinatorial loss is unsurprising, as it has been used in many areas, though without a uniform name or formulation. For example, in areas such as molecule design and chip design, it is usual to use the panelty in reward design for hard or soft constraints. It is also used in solving combinatorial problems to guide the feasible and quality of solutions. This kind of methods are like the Lagrangian multiplier method, and the idea of modeling the constraints as a loss term is straightforward. There are also many methods targeting on solving combinatorial problems, such as mixed-integer programmings, by generative models, where the combinatorial constraints are also considered. This paper is more like a gatherer of those methods. If I am wrong, the authors may want to further emphasise the technical contribution.
2. In experiments, the authors report the loss values for evaluation. However, the loss function may not reflect the generation quality precisely, and it is more like a surrogate metric instead of the final goal. Some other metrices for evaluation should be introduced.
3. Baselines are not strong enough. When considering the specific scenarios such as game design, it is expected to compare the proposed method with the SOTA method tailored for this task, instead of only considering the GAN+MILP baseline, to demonstrate the effectiveness of GenCO.
4. If the authors claim that they propose a framework for design problems, it is expected to conduct more experiments such as molecule or chip design. Current experiments are not convincing enough.
