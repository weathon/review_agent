- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
We study online reinforcement learning in linear Markov decision processes with adversarial losses and bandit feedback. We introduce two algorithms that achieve improved regret performance compared to existing approaches. The first algorithm, although computationally inefficient, achieves a regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ without relying on simulators, where $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first rate-optimal result in the considered setting. The second algorithm is computationally efficient and achieves a regret of  $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{3}{4}})$ . These results significantly improve over the prior state-of-the-art: a computationally inefficient algorithm by Kong et al. (2023) with $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{4}{5}}+1/\lambda_{\min})$ regret, and a computationally efficient algorithm by Sherman et al. (2023b) with $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{6}{7}})$ regret.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of learning in online adversarial linear Markov decision processes in the presence of partial feedback. The authors propose two algorithms. The first one achieves optimal $\sqrt{K}$ regret bound while being computationally inefficient. The second one achieves a regret bound of order $K^\frac{3}{4}$, while being computationally efficient.

### Strengths
The paper is clear and well-written. The setting the paper studies is of interest both from a theoretical and a practical perspective, and it has gained lots of attention in the last few years. The theoretical results, both for the efficient setting and the inefficient one, are surely improving the state-of-the-art. Indeed, the paper answers different questions raised by prior work (e.g., whether the $\sqrt{K}$ regret bound was achievable). From an algorithmic perspective, even if the authors employ many existing techniques such as dilated bonus and FTRL with logdet barrier, the novelty is clear. The theoretical analysis is interesting and non-trivial, even if part of it is partially adapted from existing work.

### Weaknesses
- The MDP has a layered structure. Indeed, this is standard in the literature of online learning in Markov decision process and it is without loss of generality. Nevertheless, the dependency on the decision space could be worse than the one presented in the paper for not loop-free MDPs.
- The dependency of the regret bound on the horizon and the feature vector dimension is far from being good.

### Questions
I am interested in understanding why the adversary is assumed to be oblivious. In online episodic adversarial MDP research area, the adversary can be adaptive.

### Summary
This work establishes the first rate-optimal algorithm for adversarial linear MDPs with bandit feedback, though it is computationally inefficient. Besides, this work also provides a computationally efficient policy optimization (PO)-based algorithm with $\widetilde{O}(K^{3/4})$ regret, improving previous SOTA result of order $\widetilde{O}(K^{6/7})$.

### Strengths
1. Results: The problem of rate optimal results for learning adversarial linear MDPs with bandit feedback has been open since [1]. It is exciting to see an algorithm, though not computationally efficient, obtaining the rate optimal result for this challenging problem.
2. Novelty: The rate optimal algorithm takes the same viewpoint that reducing the adversarial linear MDP problem as an adversarial linear bandit problem as [2], but new algorithmic designs are proposed to achieve the rate optimal result, which might be of independent interest. I think the combination of existing techniques to devise a computationally efficient PO-based algorithm with $\widetilde{O}(K^{3/4})$ regret also has its merits.
3. Writing: In general, this paper is well-written, with sufficient discussions on the algorithm designs.

### Weaknesses
1. In this work, Algorithm 1 used to estimate $ \hat{\mu}^\pi $ for policy $\pi $ needs to solve a complicated optimization problem, which might be less appealing for practitioners in the RL community. However, I think this is not a fatal weakness, given both the hardness of this problem and the technical novelty in the design of the first algorithm.
2. Giving a table that shows the comparisons of regret bounds with most related works might further benefit the readers, in my opinion.

### Questions
1. Can the authors give a brief discussion about the possibility or the main barriers to achieving the rate-optimal result for PO-based methods?

### Summary
The paper studies the linear Markov decision processes(MDP) with adversarial losses and bandit feedback. This paper first 1) introduces a computationally inefficient algorithm that achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$, for $K$ as the number of episode in this MDP, and then 2) introduces a second algorithm that is computationally efficient and achieves $\tilde{O}(K^{3/4})$ regret. The first algorithm is nearly optimal, and the second algorithm significantly improves the state-of-the-art.

### Strengths
- The presentation of this paper is good, and display a relatively clean and timely literature review.
- This paper clearly presents the intuition behind the results presented in this paper, as well as the similarities and differences between the algorithm and the state-of-the-art (SOTA), and where SOTA offers further improvement on regret, e.g. paragraphs in section 3.1
- The result of this paper is a significant improvement of state-of-the-art.

### Weaknesses
- The pseudo-code of algorithm 1 lacks explanations. 
- This paper is purely theoretical, and hence doesn't have empirical evaluations.

### Questions
- What is the practical motivation of this problem? 
- With the help of simulators, K^{2/3} regret can be obtained, what is changed when the simulator of the environment is available?

### Summary
This work studies RL on adversarial MDPs with bandit feedback. In detail, the authors proposed the first algorithms for linear MDPs with the standard $\sqrt{K}$ regret. Although with a $\sqrt{K}$ regret, such algorithms are not computationally efficient since the computation complexity depends on the state complexity $|\cS|$. The authors also proposed computationally efficient algorithms with a $K^{3/4}$ regret, which is also the SOTA result.

### Strengths
The improvement of the existing regret results for linear MDP with adversarial loss is very important for the research community. The presentation of this paper is also very clear.

### Weaknesses
I do not find any obvious weaknesses in this work.

### Questions
1. Can the authors discuss the possibility of designing an algorithm with a minimax-optimal regret guarantee? Such a result has already been established in [1,2] for linear mixture MDPs with/without adversarial losses, with the full information feedback. [2] also established a lower bound of regret which depends on $\log|\cS|$ and $\log|\cA|$. Does the same lower bound also hold for the bandit feedback setting?
