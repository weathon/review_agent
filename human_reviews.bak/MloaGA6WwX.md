- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
This paper presents a data-driven, task-specific paradigm for experimental design, to shorten acquisition time, reduce costs, and accelerate the deployment of imaging devices.  Current approaches in experimental design focus on model-parameter estimation and require specification of a particular model, whereas in imaging, other tasks may drive the design.  Furthermore, such approaches often lead to intractable optimization problems in real-world imaging applications. Here we present a new paradigm for experimental design that simultaneously optimizes the design (set of image channels) and trains a machine-learning model to execute a user-specified image-analysis task. The approach obtains data densely-sampled over the measurement space (many image channels) for a small number of acquisitions, then identifies a subset of channels of prespecified size that best supports the task.  We propose a method: TADRED for TAsk-DRiven Experimental Design in imaging, to identify the most informative channel-subset  whilst simultaneously training a network to execute the task given the subset. Experiments demonstrate the potential of TADRED in diverse imaging applications: several clinically-relevant tasks in magnetic resonance imaging; and remote sensing and physiological applications of hyperspectral imaging. Results show substantial improvement over classical experimental design, two recent application-specific methods within the new paradigm, and state-of-the-art approaches in supervised feature selection.  We anticipate further applications of our approach.  Code is available: https://github.com/sbb-gh/experimental-design-multichannel

## Human Reviews

## Human Reviewer 1

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work suggests a task-driven paradigm for experimental design for real-world imaging applications, that does not require a-priori model specification and replaces high-dimensional continuous search with a subsampling problem.

### Strengths
+ Well written paper. 
+ Good structure for Intro, related work and methods. 
+ The problem setting and contributions are clearly communicated. 
+ Comprehensive previous work and comparison to baselines.

### Weaknesses
- Hard to follow the results and it feels like they are rashly presented. I would reiterate table 1,2 and fig 2 and explain better what are the columns rows etc. Consider taking some information from appendix to the main text. 
- Also you repeat some of the results from the beginning of section 4 afterwards in different paragraphs, which makes it hard to follow. I would reiterate here.

### Questions
- To me it is still not so clear the difference between feature selection and experimental design optimisation.In paper you mention the difference about features being irrelevant and channels being repetitive. How do you ensure or balance this in your work? Is there a specific loss you use?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach to Experimental Design in imaging tasks, where the goal is to select a restricted set of channels from multi-channel images to solve a given task (e.g. reconstruction of missing channels).
The approach relies on 2 networks optimized jointly: a score-network and a task network. Throughout optimization, channels are dropped at regular intervals based on the score-network's average output for these channels.
Experiments on several datasets are then conducted to show the efficiency of the approach.

### Strengths
- **Code**: The code is present and allows reproducing the results.
- **Experiments**: The experimental section shows impressive results and must have required a huge amount of work to benchmark all these datasets and all these methods.
- **Prior work**: The prior work is abundantly discussed in relation to the proposed approach which makes for a great read and gives a lot of interesting context to understand the relevance of the different implementation choices.
- **Clarity**: More generally, I would say the paper is well written and clear, with particularly well-worked figures.

### Weaknesses
- **Validation of score network**: I think a nice validation that the score network is actually working as intended would be to set random score values at the beginning of optimization of TADRED for each channel (and keep them fixed). This way, the task network is optimized for the same number of steps and in the same manner, i.e. with gradually less channels. Maybe this gradual aspect is actually making the reconstruction network better and it's why TADRED is performing better. I list this as a weakness and not as a question, because to me the experiments are lacking of proof that the score network is working as intended and not just a smart preprocessor or anything else.
- **Experiments**: my current problem with the experimental section is that I see it in 2 folds: qMRI/EOS where TADRED outperforms state-of-the-art | others where TADRED outperforms baselines. In the others setting, I gather that there was no previous interest reported in the literature for solving the task with ED (i.e. no published results to compare against). For qMRI/EOS, I have an issue because it seems that these 2 tasks have not gathered a lot of interest either if we simply look at the citation count for the papers introducing the challenges (17 for MUDI and 5 for EOS).

This last reason is why I am not increasing my score at the moment.

### Questions
- I see that random feature selection sometimes performs on par with other methods especially in high number of selected channels regimes. Why is that?

### Summary
The paper presents a new task-specific scheme for experimental design for imaging data and application. The authors focus on expanding the design to go beyond and aim at user-specific analysis tasks at the same time. The authors proposed the TAsk-DRiven experimental design in imaging, or TADRED, to select the channel-subset while at the same time carry out the tasks.

### Strengths
1. The case studies are quite extensive and substantial, showing the performance of the proposed framework against a variety of applications in feature selection.

### Weaknesses
1. In the experiment section, although quite a number of baselines are used for comparison, including Fisher-matrix, the baselines are not clearly explained. Some details are included in the appendix, but it may be better to at least explain one of them in detail.

### Summary
This paper develops an automated approach for channel subsampling and successfully applies this apporach to several MRI and hyperspectral imaging applications. The approach, TADRED, combines existing feature selection literature with recursive feature elimination (RFE). In particular, TADRED gradually reduces the number of features/channels used. Each time it reduces the feature/channel set it solves an optimization problem (3) that simultaneously trains a network to solve a task, designs a binary mask (optimized as continuous numbers) that subsamples the remaining channels, and learns a weighting matrix that weights the remaining channels fed into the network. TADRED outperforms several baselines on 6 distinct tasks.

### Strengths
Proposed method is validated across many distinct tasks

Proposed methods seems to outperform existing baselines by a small margin.

Selecting a subset of informative channels is an interesting problem.

### Weaknesses
The paper could do a better job explaining the proposed method. For instance, algorithm 2 would benefit from additional comments. I have little intuition for what each step is trying to do.

The figures table captions are generally uninformative which makes the results very difficult to follow: 
-In figure 1, "Model Free" is uninformative.
-Table 1 is very hard to parse. It's essentially two tables, with the top table having a different format than the bottom one.
-Table 2 doesn't mention MRI anywhere.
-Figure 2 is covered with arrows, but the caption doesn't state what they're pointing to. 

"Feature Fill" is not defined in the main text

### Questions
##  Minor comments
The sentence, "e.g. the standard design for VERDICT model Panagiotaki et al. (2015a) (used as a baseline in table 1) is computed by optimizing the Fisher-matrix for one specific combination of parameter values, despite aiming to highlight contrast in those parameters throughout the entire prostate" in related work is provided without the context of prostate cancer.

The statement "Rather than learning the mask mt end-to-end e.g. using a sparsity term/prior, we modify elements of mt during our training procedure" could use further clarification

The baseline methods were all published in medical imaging journals. This work might be better appreciated, and receive more informed reviews, in such a venue.
