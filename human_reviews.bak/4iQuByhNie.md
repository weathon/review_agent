# ContextNER: Contextual Phrase Generation at Scale

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 6

## Abstract
Named Entity Recognition (NER) has seen significant progress in recent years, with numerous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models achieving high performance. 
However, very few studies have focused on the generation of entities' context.
In this paper, we introduce ContextNER, a task that aims to generate the relevant context for entities in a sentence, where the context is a phrase describing the entity but not necessarily present in the sentence. 
To facilitate research in this task, we also present the EDGAR10-Q dataset, which consists of annual and quarterly reports from the top 1500 publicly traded companies. 
The dataset is the largest of its kind, containing 1M sentences, 2.8M entities, and an average of 35 tokens per sentence, making it a challenging dataset. 
We propose a baseline approach that combines a phrase generation algorithm with inferencing using a 220M language model, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 27% on the test split.
Additionally, we perform a one-shot inference with ChatGPT, which obtains a 30% ROUGE-L, highlighting the difficulty of the dataset. 
We also evaluate models such as T5 and BART, which achieve a maximum ROUGE-L  of 49% after supervised finetuning on EDGAR10-Q. 
We also find that T5-large, when pre-finetuned on EDGAR10-Q, achieve SOTA results on downstream finance tasks such as Headline, FPB, and FiQA SA, outperforming vanilla version by 10.81 points.
To our surprise, this 66x smaller pre-finetuned model also surpasses the finance-specific LLM BloombergGPT-50B by 15 points. 
We hope that our dataset and generated artifacts will encourage further research in this direction, leading to the development of more sophisticated language models for financial text analysis

### Summary
The paper proposes a new task in which entities mentioned in text need to be described. This is helpful for non-experts to understand quantities and dates in financial text. The authors introduced new dataset called EDGAR10-Q of sentences extracted from annual and quarterly financial reports. The entities were automatically extracted and described by experts. Besides, the authors introduced a baseline based on machine reading comprehension model, which doesn't require to train. The authors carried out experiments with several systems: the proposed baseline, few-shot chatgpt, some generative models (e.g. T5). The authors performed some analyses and found that pre-finetuning on EDGAR10-Q (e.g. using T5) is beneficial for some financial downstream tasks, even better than using LLM BloombergGPT 50B.

### Strengths
The paper is original in the sense that the proposed task is new.

### Weaknesses
One of the main limitation of the paper is its dataset, EDGAR10-Q. 

* First of all, it is unclear how the data were annotated. The paper emphasizes that "These reports are prepared by domain experts (financial analysts), ensuring highest quality of gold labels and contextual relevance." but nowhere in the paper mentions the job of experts. The paper also does not presents the quality of annotation. 

* Secondly, it is not clear why entity descriptions can contain information outside of the given sentence. For instance, in "There were impairments of \\$0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and [\\$2.2 million] for the six months ended June 30, 2020.", why could "\\$2.2 million" can be "valuation allowance for loan"? What is the evidence for that? If the reason is of domain "common sense", how many experts agree with that annotation? The major concern is that if the sentence itself doesn't contain any evidence, a model trained on this dataset can generate hallucination. 


Another limitation is that it is unclear about why the baseline is introduced. In the experiments, the baseline is clearly outperformed. The baseline doesn't have any contribution to the community either. 

Writing is also a major limitation. The paper is difficult to follow as its main text is not self-sufficient. To understand the main text, readers need to check appendices. For instance, the main text doesn't introduce the used MRC model, how BERT is used in that model. In the experiments, how were the used generative models finetuned? The number 30.31% (last paragraph page 6) isn't introduced at all in the main text. In additions, there are several typos such as "Additionally, In..." (sec 2).

### Questions
In section 6.3., the authors "[...] use BloombergGPT-50B Wu et al. (2023) 10 shot score as the baseline". What does it mean by "10 shot score"? 

How was T5 finetuned on  EDGAR10-Q? Is that supervised finetuning?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new task that aims to generate the relevant context for entities in a sentence and builds a dataset called EDGAR10-Q, which contains 1M sentences, 2.8M entities, and an average of 35 tokens per sentence sourced from the finance domain. The authors conducted comprehensive experiments and proved that the EDGAR10-Q dataset is challenging for LLMs. Furthermore, they also built a baseline for the dataset.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
- Experiments seem to be solid and comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
- There are four types of entities in the EDGAR10-Q dataset. They are all about numbers. 
- Entity types defined in the paper, such as money, dates, etc, may not belong to named entities referring to guidelines of many research datasets (e.g., OntoNotes 5.0, ACE 2004). It is more accurate to refer to these types as attributes of a person or organization. Although some NER taggers (e.g., stanford ner tagger) also recognize the aforementioned types as named entities. 
- The objective of the introduced task is unreasonable. Some entities defined in the paper, such as "time", "money", do not depend on the sentence context. It seems to be facts or results of an event. It seems unreasonable to generate a phrase based on an irrelevant sentence.
It is more accurate to define the task as to generate a concept description given a sentence rather than context NER. 
- The contribution of this work is controversial because the quality of the work cannot be judged based on the difficulty it poses for ChatGPT.

### Questions
- Is there an annotation file to ensure each instance in the dataset is annotated under the same guideline?
- Why use BERT-Base as the baseline rather than using the FInBERT?

### Summary
This paper introduces the context-ner task of generating relevant context for entities in a sentence and presents the EDGAR10-Q dataset, which is a large dataset with 1M sentences and 2.8M entities. The paper proposes a baseline approach and evaluate various models, where T5-large achieves state-of-the-art results on the context-ner task. Additionally, they found that pre-trained on the context-ner task can help on other finance downstream tasks. Overall, the paper's contributions include introducing a new task and dataset, proposing a baseline approach, and evaluating various models on the task.

### Strengths
- This paper introduces a new task of generating relevant context for entities in a sentence, which is a novel problem formulation.The EDGAR10-Q dataset, which is the largest of its kind with 1M sentences and 2.8M entities, is a significant contribution to the field. 
- The authors also propose a baseline approach that uses a combination of question generation and reading comprehension to generate contextual phrases for entities. 
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents the problem formulation, baseline approach, and evaluation results. The authors provide detailed descriptions of the models evaluated and the evaluation metrics used. The paper also includes a human evaluation case study, which adds to the quality of the paper.
- The new task of generating relevant context for entities in a sentence has interesting applications in finance, and is somewhat surprising for to improve the downstream performance by a large margin. The EDGAR10-Q dataset is a valuable resource for researchers working on similar problems. Overall, this paper makes significant contributions and has the potential to inspire further research in this area.

### Weaknesses
- One potential weakness is that the paper does not provide a clear annotation procedure for the dataset. I understand the procedure of collecting publicly available annual reports and extract the paragraphs, but I cannot search any detail about how to get the phrase labels given these entities. Are they automatically extracted from the annual report? Or the labels are annotated by humans following the instruction in Appendix D.1?
- It's unfair to compare the model fine-tuned on EDGAR10-Q with the BloombergGPT-50B model since the model performs the task via a few-shot manner while the T5 model is fine-tuned on the dataset. And a dataset analysis about the potential entity overlap between EDGAR10-Q and the downstream benchmark (e.g., FiQA) would be more helpful to understand the benefits. Also, what would happen if we continually pre-train the model on EDGAR10-Q corpus using T5 objectives (i.e., not predicting the phrase label, but pre-training on these finance text).
- While the authors report the overall performance of the models, it would be much better if they provide a breakdown of the types of errors made or the specific examples where the models fail / be improved after fine-tuning on EDGAR10-Q. This information would be valuable for understanding why the model performance is improved after fine-tuning on EDGAR10-Q.
