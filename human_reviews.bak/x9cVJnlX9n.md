# Risk-Controlling Model Selection via Guided Bayesian Optimization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Adjustable hyperparameters of machine learning models typically impact various key trade-offs such as accuracy, fairness, robustness, or inference cost. Our goal in this paper is to find a configuration that adheres to user-specified limits on certain risks while being useful with respect to other conflicting metrics. We solve this by combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with rigorous risk-controlling procedures, where our core idea is to steer BO towards an efficient testing strategy. Our BO method identifies a set of Pareto optimal configurations residing in a designated region of interest. The resulting candidates are statistically verified and the best-performing configuration is selected with guaranteed risk levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of tasks with multiple desiderata, including low error rates, equitable predictions, handling spurious correlations, managing rate and distortion in generative models, and reducing computational costs.

### Summary
This paper adds to the growing body of literature with respect to distribution free uncertainty quantification and risk control.  While most work in this area descends from the line of work concerned with Conformal Prediction, the field was really expanded and energized by the work of Angelopoulos et al (2021) called Learn Then Test, which introduces a method for performing hypothesis/model/parameter selection based on multi-hypothesis testing (MHT) and family-wise error rates.  One clear inefficiency of this LTT procedure is that statistical power is lost as more hypotheses are considered; this issue was directly addressed in the work of Laufer-Goldshtein et al (2022), wherein an initial step is added in order to narrow some larger configuration space down to a set of hypotheses that are worth considering during MHT.

The current submission aims to further build on the work of Laufer-Goldshtein.  Their algorithm modifies Laufer-Goldshtein in two key ways, by: 1) further narrowing the hypothesis search space by defining a region of interest based on various loss calculations on a validation set prior to testing 2) using Bayesian Optimization to efficiently identify configurations that both are Pareto-optimal and lie within the region of interest.  They apply their algorithm to important problems like fair and robust classification, image generation, and large model pruning.

### Strengths
The authors address an important problem with this work.  Though risk control techniques are a key ingredient in responsible machine learning deployment, they are limited by the fact that they either have to ignore a large part of the search space or sacrifice statistical power in order to consider all reasonable hyperparameter settings.  While this was addressed in the previous Pareto Testing paper, more work in this direction is great.  The idea of further reducing the search space using the validation set and BO seems quite natural.

### Weaknesses
-I find the definition of the region of interest to be under-motivated.  It is not clear why the region of interest is defined in this way; it would be useful to further motivate the definition by some worked example or analysis, and the definition could be compared/contrasted with other possible ways for defining the region.  It may be the case that the algorithm is primarily focused on the case where objectives are conflicting; if this is so, it should be stated more clearly, along with a description of how the algorithm will perform when this is not the case.

-While the authors seem to be motivated by the problem of “expansive high-volume configuration spaces”, their experimental applications seem to have configuration spaces that are of a similar size as those in previous work.  While performing better in these spaces is useful, it would also be interesting to see that this algorithm enables some new class of problem(s) to be addressed via MHT.  

-In addition, the experiments section does not make a strong case for the current algorithm.  There are several reasons for this: 

1) Unexplained hyperparameter choices - how is $\delta'$ chosen?  This seems very important, and I see no mention of this in the experiments section (also see questions below).

2) Unclear how limits of x-axes were chosen - Why should we only be concerned with $\alpha \in [0.165, 0.18]$ for Figure 3(a) or $\alpha \in [0.055, 0.07]$ in Figure 3(b)?  These choices seem arbitrary, and make it hard to takeaway that the method is generally better than the simple baseline.

3) Insignificant results based on standard deviation - Figure 3(a) and 3(b) do not show the proposed algorithm to be much better than a fairly naive baseline in what seems to be a highly-controlled setting (see (1) and (2) above).  

-Further building on the previous comment, I think the experiments section would benefit from a focus on less results that are more clearly explained.  Even examining the details in the appendix leaves many experimental choices a mystery.

-Since it is not clear why this definition of the region of interest is of particular significance (either via analysis or empirical results), I find the contribution to be incremental and short of the acceptance threshold, although I could be convinced otherwise by other reviews and/or author rebuttals (see questions below).

### Questions
Below are the major questions that I am left with after reviewing the paper.  Since the authors are solving an important problem, I could be convinced to raise my score if I can come to a better understanding of why this is a particularly well-motivated and effective solution:

-Can you give a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind the definition of the ROI?  When is it expected to be most effective, and when may it fail?

-Can you more concretely characterize the efficiency of your method in relation to Pareto Testing?  How much compute or time is actually being saved, and how much performance is lost compared to full Pareto Testing?  I think this should be covered more thoroughly in the experiments section, as this seems to be the main comparison made prior to the experiments section.

-How is $\delta'$ chosen? This seems like an important parameter, but I cannot find a reference to its value in the experiments, nevermind how that value is chosen.  Right now, it seems possible that equation (7) is not actually that important, but instead the ROI is just based on a heuristic choice of tolerance around $\alpha^{max}$.  An ablation with respect to this parameter would also be helpful.

### Summary
The authors incorporate risk control into multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO). The problem setting assumes $c$ objective functions with constraints that are desired to hold with high probability, and $1$ unconstrained objective function that is desired to be minimized. The proposed method is as follows: 1) Define a fixed region of interest based on the desired significance level and sizes of validation and calibration datasets; 2) run a MOBO algorithm with reference point chosen each iteration based on the region of interest and posterior mean of the unconstrained objective function; 3) do hypothesis testing to pick the final configuration so that the constraints hold with high probability. The proposed method is empirically evaluated.

### Strengths
1. Incorporating risk control to do constrained MOBO is novel and likely to be of interest to the BO community.
2. The empirical settings are realistic and interesting, including settings on fairness and robustness, and VAEs and transformers.
3. The paper is generally written well.

### Weaknesses
1. **Empirical investigation does not properly evaluate main contribution.** As far as I can tell, the main novel contribution is the method of defining the region of interest and the reference point, after which an existing MOBO algorithm is used, and an existing algorithm for testing the validity of the returned configuration is used. The method of defining the region of interest and the reference point is not theoretically backed, which means that its usefulness is supported purely by the empirical results. However, the empirical investigation compares the entire procedure to existing MOBO algorithms (under only the Pruning setting), and the existing MOBO algorithms do not undergo the testing procedure. It is unclear how much of the performance gain is due to the main contribution (region of interest and reference point) and how much is due to the testing. The paper should include ablation studies to empirically support the claim that the main contribution is useful. How does the proposed method perform without defining the region of interest? How about if it is only a lower bound instead of an interval? It may turn out that most of the performance gain is due to the testing, rendering the main contribution not useful.

    Furthermore, it is not clear why no previous baselines are tested in the results for Figures 3 and 5. The empirical evaluation is the only support for the proposed method, and it needs to be more comprehensive.

2. **Clarity issues**. See Questions section.

### Questions
1. In the second paragraph of Sec. 3 Problem Formulation, should it be $L_i : \mathcal Y \times \mathcal Y \times \Lambda \rightarrow \mathbb R$ instead? In this case, $L_i$ in the preceding expectation should be $L_i(f_\lambda(X), Y, \lambda)$.

2. In Equation (7), should the formula for $\ell_{\text{low}}$ and $\ell_{\text{high}}$ be swapped? 

3. In Algorithm D.1 line 9, how exactly is $\mathbf \ell (\lambda_{n+1})$ evaluated? Using $\mathcal D_{\text{train}}$ or $\mathcal D_{\text{cal}}$ ? From the line "while running the BO procedure we only have access to finite-size validation data $|\mathcal D_{\text{val}}| = k$", it sounds like it should be $\mathcal D_{\text{cal}}$. But $\mathcal D_{\text{cal}}$ is not passed into Algorithm D.1, hence the confusion.

4. Why aren't the previous MOBO algorithms tested in the results in Figures 3 and 5? What about the $n=1$ case prevents these baselines from being tested?

### Summary
The paper tackles the problem of finding a configuration adhering to user-specified limits on certain aspects whilst being useful with respect to various conflicting metrics. The main idea is to formulate as a multi-objective optimization problem with multiple hypothesis tests. The paper first proposes to identify a region of interest that limits the search space for candidate configurations to obtain efficient testing with less computation. The paper then presents a new BO process that can identify configurations that are Pareto optimal and lie in the region of interest. The paper presents experimental results on various problems including classification fairness, classification robustness, VAE, and transformer pruning.

### Strengths
+ The paper tackles a quite interesting and general problem. I think this generic problem could be very useful in different settings like fairness, robustness, etc.
+ The paper’s writing is generally clear and easy to understand when describing about the problem settings, the motivation, the related work and the experimental evaluation.
+ I think the key idea of the proposed algorithm seems to be sound and reasonable – however, there are some detailed information I found unclear (which I ask in the below section).
+ Different categories of problems are used in the experimental evaluation – this helps to understand the applications of the problem setting in this paper.

### Weaknesses
There are various unclear descriptions of the proposed technique. I list in the below some points that I found unclear:
+ The formulation of the region of interest seems unclear to me. I don’t understand how Eq. (5) – which is to compute the p-value - is derived. And is this inequality be able to apply for any loss function $l(\lambda)$? Are there any particular requirements regarding this loss function for Eq. (5) to hold? Eq. (6) is also suddenly introduced without clear explanation why $\alpha^\max$ is defined that way.
+ In Eq. (7), there is also no clear explanation on how the confidence interval is constructed that way. What is the role of $\delta’$ here? How can it be chosen in practice? What significant level is associated with this confidence interval?
+ I’m not sure if I missed it but it seems like there is no proof of Theorem 5.1?

One of the main weaknesses to me is actually in the experimental evaluation. Below are my concerns regarding the experimental evaluation:
+ Among 4 test problems, three problems (classification fairness, classification robustness, VAE) actually only have a single-dimensional hyperparameter.
+ For the baselines of problems of one single-dimensional hyperparameter, I don’t understand why Uniform is chosen as a baseline but not Random. Why don’t we compare with both Uniform and Random for all problems? And why we don’t compare with a standard multi objective optimization method that does not make use of the region of interest?
+ Finally, the range of the value $\alpha$ seems to be quite small to me, e.g., for the classification fairness problem, the range of $\alpha$ is only from 0.165 to 0.180 or for the robustness problem, the range of $\alpha$ is only from 0.055 to 0.070.

### Summary
The paper presents a new methodology for selecting model configurations/hyper-parameters based on user-defined risk constraints and performance metrics. By combining Bayesian Optimization (BO) with rigorous statistical testing, the authors aim to achieve efficient model selection. They introduce the concept of a "region of interest" in the objective space to optimize model parameters more efficiently. The proposed method has been shown to be versatile across various domains, including algorithmic fairness, robustness, and model efficiency.

### Strengths
The problem is of practical importance. In industry, the optimization cannot be done without any constraints and the "Risk-Controlling" factor in this paper is the primary focus. This paper proposed a relatively rigorous way to handle the problem with good experiment results. The work is further extended to the MOO setting which enables more potential applications of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The primary concern is whether the paper fits ICLR in general. The paper is focusing on statistical test based theories and proposing algorithms which are not directly related to representation learning.

2. This might be subjective, but many of the contents until page 5 are fairly standard, while later many details have to be put in the appendix. The narratives in section 6 and 7 are also not clear or confusing. The writing can be improved.

3. The sign of (7) should be changed

4. The practical use of the proposed method. The significance level \sigma is usually not the crucial factor, but rather performance or business metrics related to the objective function.

5. Though in the intro part the potentials of the proposed method are claimed to cover different areas, in the experiment section the test is only done on limited tasks.

### Questions
Please see the weakness part. Plus the following

1. How does the proposed method perform in situations with extremely high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces?

2. How sensitive is the proposed method to the initial definition of the "region of interest"? Is there a risk of introducing bias based on this region?

3. Given that Bayesian Optimization inherently deals with a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, how does the new approach ensure a balance, especially with the introduced "region of interest"?

4. In practical terms, what would be the computational overhead of the proposed method compared to traditional BO or other hyper-parameter optimization techniques?
