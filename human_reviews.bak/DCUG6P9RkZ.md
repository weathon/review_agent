- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
We present a new algorithm for imitation learning in infinite horizon linear MDPs dubbed ILARL which greatly improves the bound on the number of trajectories that the learner needs to sample from the environment. 
In particular, we remove exploration assumptions required in previous works and we improve the dependence on the desired accuracy $\epsilon$ from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$.
Our result relies on a connection between imitation learning and online learning in MDPs with adversarial losses. For the latter setting, we present the first result for infinite horizon linear MDP which may be of independent interest. Moreover, we are able to provide a strengthen result for the finite horizon case where we achieve $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Numerical experiments with linear function approximation shows that ILARL outperforms other commonly used algorithms.

### Summary
This paper aims to design better provably imitation learning (IL) algorithms in discounted linear MDP. In discounted linear MDP, the existing provably IL method PPIL ignores the exploration issue and thus requires the persistent excitation assumption. This paper presents a new method ILARL which is free of such an assumption. In particular, the key to removing such an assumption is the reduction of IL to online optimization with adversarial losses. With this reduction, the target becomes to design a provably RL algorithm in adversarial MDPs. To achieve this goal, this paper first presents an algorithm in the finite-horizon adversarial MDPs and then extends it to the infinite-horizon case. Finally, this paper plugs this RL algorithm into the IL framework, which yields the ILARL algorithm. The authors prove that ILARL has better theoretical guarantees than previous algorithms regarding the number of expert trajectories and MDP trajectories.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents a new IL algorithm ILARL and conducts a rigorous theoretical analysis. Compared with the previous SOTA IL method in discounted linear MDP, ILARL removes the persistent excitation assumption and attains better theoretical guarantees on the number of expert trajectories and MDP trajectories.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing clear explanations and detailed descriptions of the proposed method and theoretical analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. The algorithmic designs and analysis techniques in this paper are not new. In terms of algorithmic designs, the main difference between ILARL, and existing IL algorithms OAL and OGAIL is the policy optimization step. However, the policy optimization algorithm in ILARL is highly similar to the one in [Sherman et al., 2023b]. 
For theoretical analysis, the key step to removing the persistent excitation assumption is the regret decomposition in Eq.(2), which reduces IL to online optimization with adversarial losses. However, such a regret decomposition has been presented in OAL. Furthermore, among the three types of errors, policy regret is the most difficult part to analyze. However, the analysis of the policy regret in Theorem 3 largely depends on existing techniques developed in OAL and [Sherman et al., 2023b].
2. The empirical evaluation is limited. This paper only considers a simple 2D environment. It is expected to verify the effectiveness of ILARL on more complicated tasks. Besides, this paper does not involve OGAIL for comparison.

### Questions
1. Line 9 in Algorithm 3 is a little confusing. Algorithm 2 is a complete RL method that runs for K iterations while line 9 only corresponds to a one-iterate policy update.   
2. Typos:
    1. Line 4 in the first paragraph in Section 1: which compete → which competes.
    2. Table 1: OLA → OAL.
    3. Line 14 in Algorithm 1, Line 11 in Algorithm 2: as the cost function is considered, we should minus the bonus function in updating Q functions.

### Summary
The paper proposes an algorithm called ILARL for imitation learning in infinite horizon linear MDP. The authors relax the exploration assumptions in previous works and improve the rate from $O(\epsilon^{-5})$ to $O(\epsilon^{-4}$. The results are built upon a connection between imitation learning and online learning with adversarial lossses. Moreover, the paper presents a strengthen result for the finite horizon case and achieve $O(\epsilon^{-2}$. The empirical results also show that ILARL outperforms other methods.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a new algorithm that requires less expert trajectories and MDP trajectories to achieve the $\epsilon$ optimal result in both cases of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon. The results is solid and techniques are novel.
- The paper presents the result and the analysis in a nice way such that it is easy to follow.
- The empirical study also supports the theoretical results about the performance of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
- The paper shows that the learned policy achieve the similar performance as the expert policy. I am wondering if there is any guarantee on the recovery of the true cost function.
- The linear MDP assumption is restrictive. The contribution of the paper can be more significant if it can be extended to general MDPs.
- Although the paper claims that it studies linear MDPs, Assumptions 1-3 are considering the finite state-action case. 
- The empirical study is performed on a articrafted MDP rather than a real reinforcement learning environment.

### Questions
- Is it possible to extend the result to general MDPs rather than simple linear MDPs?

### Summary
The paper provides a new algorithm for imitation learning under linear MDP setting. By introducing the online learning in MDPs with adversarial losses, the author improves the bound of interactions number with the MDP from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$.

Additionally, unlike previous work, these results do not rely on exploratory assumptions, thereby offering broader applicability.

### Strengths
The paper presents a new algorithm, ILARL, namely Imitation Learning via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning algorithm. According to the results in the paper, the required trajectories number in the proposed algorithm has better dependence in $\epsilon$ to achieve the same accuracy. The idea from adversarial online learning is adopted to design this algorithm.

### Weaknesses
The paper does not keep consistent notations: $\mathcal{A}$ is used for action space in MDP setting and an algorithm in definition 1; Cost function is utilised in MDP setting, but the numerical experiments adopt reward function setting.

In addition, the paper claims that the ILARL algorithm improves the dependence of accuracy $\epsilon$ from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$, but the dependence of dimension $d$ increases from $d^2$ to $d^3$, so one natural question is that how to carefully select these parameters so that the proposed algorithm indeed requires less trajectories than the latest algorithm in Viano's paper in 2022.

The norm inequalities in assumptions 1-2 seem very technical, and it would be better if the authors could provide some insights about them.

### Questions
1. The mathematical formulation for state value function in finite time horizon is pretty strange. I suppose the summation should take from 1 to $h$?

2. The infinite horizon trajectories, according to the description in section 2, have random length sampled from the geometric distribution. Why geometric distribution is adopted here? The sampled number is still finite, so the cost in the time horizons greater than the sampled number is set to zero?

3. In algorithm 3, line 6, the proposed algorithm project $w^{k+1}$ to the unit ball. How to ensure that the projected $w$ still constitute an adversarial costs in $[0, 1]$, as assumed in the MDP setting in section 2? Similar question happens to algorithm 4, line 7.

4. It seems that the proposed algorithms have never updated matrix $M$, in assumption 1 and 2. Does this mean that the true transition kernel is not estimated or involved in the algorithms? 

5. The matrix $\Phi$ is already known, according to assumption 1 or 2. But assumption 3 claims that the learner has access to $\Phi$. What is the difference between the matrix $\Phi$ in assumption 3 and $\Phi$ in assumption 1 and 2?

6. As stated in remark 1, the results in theorem 1 and 2 hold with high probability. So theorem 1 and 2 actually state that the trajectories numbers are independent of $\delta$?

7. What is the y-axis in figure 1 and figure 2?

### Summary
The contribution of the paper is to provide a more sample efficient algorithm for both discounted IL in terms of the number of samples of environment interaction and expert trajectories required for the linear MDP setting. The proof involves exploiting a connection between imitation learning and online learning in MDPs with adversarial losses in the full information setting, pointed out by Viano et al (2022). The authors provide experimental evidence on a simple gridworld environment showing the utility of their approach where the algorithm always achieves near-expert policy and often surpasses it.

### Strengths
The key idea is to online-to-batch to convert the IL problem to a regret minimization problem, and use a regret decomposition developed in Viano et al (2022) which decomposes the regret into 3 parts: a regret of matching the occupancy measure of the expert under a linear cost c_k, a regret term from approximating the true linear function, $w_{\text{true}}$ capturing the reward function measured against the estimation error of the expert’s occupancy measure, and the last term being the estimation error of the expert’s occupancy measure. The first two terms in the regret decomposition are for learning a policy which performs well on the estimate of the expert’s occupancy measure on the feature space.

An empirical estimate controls the 3rd error term, the second regret term can be controlled by OGD or any other online learning algorithm, while the authors provide an improved analysis for the regret of the first term, which cannot easily be solved by a generic no-regret algorithm because of the unknown transition dynamics, which make it impossible to project onto the space of valid occupancy measures. The authors propose a no regret algorithm in two steps: Policy evaluation is done using a fresh batch of data collected on-policy to get an optimistic estimate of the Q function; policy updates are not done greedily, but are done using the average optimistic $Q$ value computed from a batch of episodes to carry out infrequent policy updates. The approach resembles an MWE update with a finite-buffer to eliminate old and inaccurate $Q$ estimates. In a sense, the approach is similar to variance reduction in stochastic optimization.

The novelty in the analysis in the paper is in showing an improved algorithm for linear MDPs with adversarial costs in the full information setting. The authors show a regret bound which scales as $\tilde{O} (d^{3/4} H^{3/2} K^{3/4})$ which improves over the previous best result of $\tilde{O} (d^{3/4} H^2 K^{3/4})$.

### Weaknesses
The paper improves the prior state of the art in the best known sample complexity for IL in the discounted and finite horizon settings, and the technical novelty is moderate. The analysis is largely to improve the best  known results for linear MDPs with adversarial costs in the full information setting. This is novel and may be of independent interest, but largely borrows insights from previous work, Viano et al (2022), the analysis of UCB in Jin et al and analysis of no-regret algorithms (MWE). I think it's still a nice contribution, but feels somewhat like an A+B(+C) type result.

Overall, the writing of the paper is ok, there is room for improvement in terms of the presentation. The related work section can be organized in a much better way. This is important to put into context the results in the paper. There are several lines of work related to this one, and so it's all the more important to structure the related section in a better way.

The experimental eval in the paper is very limited, and what seem to be on a very simple environment. While the theory in the paper is the major contribution, it would have been helpful to see a more comprehensive evaluation. I am not reducing my score for the paper because of this point, but if the paper gets rejected, I encourage the author to run more comprehensive experiments. Typically on harder environments, it is quite difficult to achieve the expert's performance, but this is not the case in any of the experiments in the paper.

The results of Rajaraman et al (2021) in the offline setting do not require linear reward or a uniform occupancy measure. These assumptions seem to be used in the online setting to get improved bounds. In the online setting, the work Swamy et al (2022) provides a general analysis of the estimator used in Lemma 10 of the paper to go beyond the uniform feature measure assumption. While in general these two lines of work are not comparable, since the current paper assumes a model where the expert is arbitrary but the optimal policy falls in a linear class, as opposed to the linear expert setting (where the expert is a linear classifier), it would be interesting to see in a future work if there is a better connection between these settings.

Minor:
1. "Therefore, the policy suboptimality scale as $H^4 \log |\Pi| / \epsilon^2$". Isn’t the policy suboptimality precisely $\epsilon$?

### Questions
1. The standard BC reduction, for the finite horizon setting argues that BC achieves a $O(H^2)$ suboptimality scaling in finite-horizon settings. This is in contrast to the discussion in the discounted setting on page 1 for BC. I am not aware of a work or analysis which states that BC requires $\widetilde{O} (1/(1-\gamma)^4)$ demonstrations in the discounted setting. It would be helpful to cite a paper here.

2. Do the results in this setting hold beyond linear MDPs, say for bilinear classes or Bellman rank bounded MDPs? It would have been nice to include a discussion about this point.
