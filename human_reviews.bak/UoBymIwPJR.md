# Query-Policy Misalignment in Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides a natural way to align RL agents’ behavior with human desired outcomes, but is often restrained by costly human feedback. To improve feedback efficiency, most existing PbRL methods focus on selecting queries to maximally improve the overall quality of the reward model, but counter-intuitively, we find that this may not necessarily lead to improved performance. To unravel this mystery, we identify a long-neglected issue in the query selection schemes of existing PbRL studies: Query-Policy Misalignment. We show that the seemingly informative queries selected to improve the overall quality of reward model actually may not align with RL agents’ interests, thus offering little help on policy learning and eventually resulting in poor feedback efficiency. We show that this issue can be effectively addressed via policy-aligned query and a specially designed hybrid experience replay, which together enforce the bidirectional query-policy alignment. Simple yet elegant, our method can be easily incorporated into existing approaches by changing only a few lines of code. We showcase in comprehensive experiments that our method achieves substantial gains in both human feedback and RL sample efficiency, demonstrating the importance of addressing query-policy misalignment in PbRL tasks.

### Summary
Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of Query-Policy Misalignment in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL). PbRL is a method where reinforcement learning (RL) agents align their behavior based on human preferences. However, the efficiency of these models is often restricted due to costly human feedback. The paper identifies that most existing PbRL methods aim to improve the reward model's quality by selecting queries but may not necessarily enhance the RL agent's performance. The authors introduce the concept of policy-aligned query and hybrid experience replay as a solution. These methods focus on improving the alignment between the queries chosen and the current interests of the RL agent, thereby enhancing feedback efficiency. This is done by simply sampling from recent trajectories.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel perspective, highlighting the overlooked issue of Query-Policy Misalignment in PbRL.
2. The proposed solution of policy-aligned query selection and hybrid experience replay is simple to implement and requires minimal changes to existing PbRL systems.
3. Comprehensive experiments on well-established benchmarks like DMControl and MetaWorld prove the substantial benefits of the proposed method in terms of feedback and sample efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1. The focus is predominantly on off-policy PbRL methods, with limited exploration of on-policy PbRL methods, which naturally select on-policy segments to query preferences.
2. The approach is quite simple and I’m not sure if it’s novel compared to methods that are more similar to on-policy methods. 
3. The paper should compare to Liu et al. Meta-Reward-Net: Implicitly Differentiable Reward Learning for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning. NeurIPS ‘22, which is the current SoTA for PbRL.
4. I thought the Figure 1, 2, 3 could be improved and explained better, both in the text, and in the figure, and in the caption.

### Questions
Could the proposed methods be adapted or combined with on-policy PbRL techniques to achieve even better results?
Are there specific scenarios or domains where the proposed method may not be as effective?
How does the system handle scenarios where human feedback might be inconsistent or contradictory?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of query-policy misalignment in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) and introduces a novel method, QPA, consisting of two main techniques, policy-aligned query selection, and hybrid experience replay, to improve the efficiency of human feedback in PbRL.

### Strengths
* This paper offers a fresh viewpoint on an underexplored issue in PbRL and proposes an interesting solution.

* The conducted experiments are extensive, covering a range of tasks and comparing against multiple benchmark methods.

* The paper is written well, the problem is clearly defined, the proposed approach is thoroughly explained, and the empirical evaluation is meticulously conducted.

* The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving significant gains in performance.

### Weaknesses
* Query-policy misalignment not conclusively proven: While the paper proposes that query-policy misalignment is an interesting hypothesis to cause a problem in PbRL, there is no comprehensive evaluation or solid evidence to confirm this proposal.

* Lack of real human experiments: The testing and validation conducted in the paper relied on a scripted annotator which is not representative of real-world users, which could limit the generalizability and applicability of the approach.

### Questions
* The paper could be strengthened by testing the proposed method under real-world conditions, using actual human annotators instead of an oracle, to test the generalizability of their results.

* Providing more implementation details or pseudocode for the proposed method would add value to the paper and make it easier for others to understand, replicate, and build upon the proposed method.

### Summary
In this work, the Authors set to improve feedback efficiency in RLHL (RL from human feedback). To this end, they propose to (1) use only recent behaviors of RL agents for queries and to (2) update RL agents using recent experiences alongside experiences uniformly sampled from the replay buffer. The Authors test their proposed sampling approaches in several existing RLHF models on a number of control benchmarks where they show improved performance in comparison to baseline approaches.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important problem of improving the feedback efficiency in RLHF. As RLHF is widely used today, in particular, with LLMs (large language models), the results offered in this work are important, timely, and definitely relevant to the community.

The simplicity of the approach is also a plus. As the Authors state in the paper, their sampling strategies require minor additions to the existing models’ code, on the order of a couple dozen lines of code, so their approach is easy to implement.

The proposed approach has been tested on a variety of control tasks where it shows improvement in performance compared to the baseline models.

Overall, I think this submission is a solid work with a clear message and thoroughly conducted experiments.

### Weaknesses
I wasn’t able to fully follow some of the logic regarding the justification of the sampling scheme design. Throughout Pages 5 and 6, I understood the equations describing the error bounds for the Q-functions and the rewards but I couldn’t see the formal connection between these bounds and the proposed sampling schemes. If there *is* a formal connection, I suggest elaborating on it, e.g. in the statement in 5.1. that goes: “By assigning more observers feedback <…> we aim to enhance the accuracy of the preference (reward) predictor <…> This aligns with the intuition from the condition <…> in Eq. (5).” Similarly, in 5.2, the claim: “The proposed mechanism can provide assurance that the Q-function is updated adequately near $d^\pi$” may need further elaboration formally supporting it. If there *isn’t* a formal connection between these claims and Eq. (5), I suggest removing Eq. (5) and the related references as, in the current standing, they may be confusing to a reader like myself.

At the same time, similar ideas have been explored in literature. The field of decision-aware model learning (or value equivariance model learning) used the idea that, in model-based RL, learning a model that’s accurate everywhere might be unnecessary and, instead, learning a model that’s only accurate in task-critical regions of the state space may offer a way of improving models’ sample complexity. Although these approaches, to my knowledge, have not been applied to RLHF, they pursued similar goals (i.e. improving the sample complexity) by using similar methods (i.e. focusing on the prediction accuracy for task-relevant states and transitions). I suggest discussing these (and similar) lines of work and their relation to the proposed sampling approach in the paper.

Post-rebuttal. The Authors have diligently addressed my concerns and, to my knowledge, did a good job of addressing the other Reviewers' concerns. Also, I see that this paper is of a much higher quality than a typical paper at this venue this year that has been assigned the same score as I initially put here. To reflect on both of these facts, I increase my score.
