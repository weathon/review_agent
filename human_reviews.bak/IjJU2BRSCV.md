## Abstract
In decision-making problems with limited training data, policy functions approximated using deep neural networks often exhibit suboptimal performance. An alternative approach involves learning a world model from the limited data and determining actions through online search. However, the performance is adversely affected by compounding errors arising from inaccuracies in the learnt world model. While methods like TreeQN have attempted to address these inaccuracies by incorporating algorithmic structural biases into their architectures, the biases they introduce are often weak and insufficient for complex decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), a novel neural network architecture that significantly strengthens the inductive bias by embedding the algorithmic structure of a best-first online search algorithm. DTS employs a learnt world model to conduct a fully differentiable online search in latent state space. The world model is jointly optimised with the search algorithm, enabling the learning of a robust world model and mitigating the effect of model inaccuracies. We address potential Q-function discontinuities arising from naive incorporation of best-first search by adopting a stochastic tree expansion policy, formulating search tree expansion as a decision-making task, and introducing an effective variance reduction technique for the gradient computation. We evaluate DTS in an offline-RL setting with a limited training data scenario on Procgen games and grid navigation task, and demonstrate that DTS outperforms popular model-free and model-based baselines.

### Summary
The paper proposes Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) which improves upon the former TreeQN method. The goal is to combine planning (through tree search in a learned world model) with a learned value function. While TreeQN expands the full tree (with a branching factor of |A|) DTS selectively only expands the most promising nodes, allowing much deeper search depth. 
The authors propose an interesting trick to overcome the discontinuity induced by the discrete choice of which node to expand further. 
They evaluate the proposed method in an Offline-RL setting on two environments.

### Strengths
* The extension to TreeQN of selectively expanding only the most promising nodes makes a lot of sense
* The handling of the discontinuity (using a telescoping sum argument) makes sense and is elegant
* I also find the Offline-RL setting to be a well-chosen benchmark. I think the argument for using inductive bias (such as planning + world model) is much stronger in this setting than in online-RL where data is 'infinite' (in a sense). 
* The experimental results seem very strong.

### Weaknesses
Please see the "Questions" section where I ask for clarification on some potential weaknesses.

In the experiment section, it would be great to show that the performance of DTS scales with the depth of the search. A core feature of tree search is that computation can be traded off against performance.

### Questions
There is two sources of potential biases that I can see, and it would be great to get some clarification on those:
1. While the loss L_Q uses the Q-learning update rule (using the $\max$ operator), the stochastic branch selection is more similar to the (expected) SARSA update rule. I'm wondering if this mis-match is a problem. In particular, is it even possible for the loss L_Q to go to zero: For example, even if we assumed we had learned the correct Q-function, I think L_Q wouldn't be 0?
2. The loss L_D has the known downside that it pushes the action-values of actions not in the dataset to -infty. This is (somewhat) intended, but unlike in typically used learned Q-functions, here the Q-function is represented as a tree search. Hence the question arises of how the DTS Q-function represents the large negative Q-values and to what extends this creates problems?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel architecture to perform differentiable tree search (DTS) in the latent space of a world model. This world model, in conjunction with the search algorithm, is optimized to produce a robust outcome and minimize model inaccuracies. The authors also tackle potential discontinuities in the Q-function by using a stochastic tree expansion policy and reduce the gradient variance by computing the REINFORCE objective using a telescoping sum. When evaluated on Procgen games and a grid navigation task, DTS surpassed both model-free and model-based baselines in performance.

### Strengths
1. The methodological contributions of the paper seem novel and interesting. The paper adopts the sophisticated search machinery used in the search literature within a TreeQN like network. The paper further proposes several solutions to mitigate the numerical issues that arise as a result. 
2. The paper is also reasonably clearly written overall. Although, I believe the related work section could be improved to better distinguish the related work from the paper’s work. 
3. The results show a convincing improvement over the chosen baselines. The baselines chosen do a good job of showing the impact of the specific improvements suggested by the paper. Furthermore, the ablation experiments provide a good analysis of the impact of the Reinforce term, telescoping sum and the auxiliary losses used.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper shows experiments only with optimal demonstrations in the offline dataset. However, given the broader appeal for offline RL, I would have appreciated experiments with sub-optimal demonstrations as well. I would expect the stochastic tree search to have higher variance during training hence making it harder to train. However, I would also expect the tree search inductive bias to be especially useful in that setting. Thus, it would be interesting to see the trade-offs involved and some related analysis. 
2. As mentioned in the previous section, I would appreciate it if the related work section is rephrased slightly to better distinguish the related work from the current work.

### Questions
Included in the above sections

The authors report the training time per iteration. I would appreciate it if the authors report the full training time and the Inference time separately. I would expect the additional stochasticity to slow the overall training time. Eitherway it would help to show them separately and include them in the discussion

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a novel neural network architecture that incorporates the structural bias of a best-first search algorithm into the network design. The authors evaluate the proposed architecture in an offline-RL setting with a limited training data scenario on Procgen games and grid navigation task, and demonstrate that DTS outperforms popular model-free and model-based baselines. The computer experiments include ablation studies and comparisons with baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed architecture in an offline-RL setting with a limited training data scenario on Procgen games and grid navigation task, and demonstrate that DTS outperforms popular model-free and model-based baselines. The computer experiments include ablation studies and comparisons with baselines.

### Weaknesses
- The text lacks an illustration of the DTS architecture. An image or scheme of the DTS architecture would be very helpful.
- It seems that the authors are assuming familiarity of the reader with other algorithms (A* search, TreeQN, etc). This assumption hurts the self-containedness of the paper. The authors should provide a brief description and/or illustration of the algorithms used in the paper.

### Questions
- The authors say "Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) is a neural network architecture that incorporates the structural bias
of a best-ﬁrst search algorithm into the network design". How is this achieved? What is the structural bias of a best-first search algorithm? In my understanding, this is the main contribution of the paper, but it is not clear how this is achieved. An explanation of how a best-first search algorithm works and what are the parallels with the DTS architecture would be extremely helpful. Ideally, an image or scheme of the DTS architecture would be very helpful.
- (3 Differentiable Tree Search) The authors provide a good description of the DTS architecture. However, it is not clear how the DTS architecture is trained.
An image or illustation of the DTS architecture would be extremely helpful to understand the model. The image could add the different submodules of the model and how they are connected.
- (4.1 Test Domains) The authors evaluate DTS in discrete action spaces. Can the authors comment on the applicability of DTS to continuous action spaces?

### Summary
This paper presents a method for incorporating tree search within a policy optimization method. At a high level this work builds upon TreeQN and incorporates a best-first search algorithm for expanding the tree as opposed to the breadth-first approach taken by TreeQN. Whereas TreeQN expands all nodes up to a fixed depth, and thus has exponential complexity based on the branching factor, the primary contribution of this work is to selectively expand nodes based on their expected value which is not subject to the same blow-up in complexity and allows the algorithm to evaluate deeper. To do so in a way that isn't subject to discontinuities the authors expand nodes by sampling proportional to the softmax of the expected value of the entire path. 

The authors also present a number of other improvements including a variance reduction technique based on a telescoping sum as noted by Guez et al. which takes advantage of the fact that by expanding the loss include repeated terms that add variance but are zero in expectation.

Similarly the authors apply their approach to problems in Batch RL using examples from an optimal policy, and hence they also introduce a term from CQL to address Q-function overestimation for infrequently visited states.

Their results show that these techniques improve over the various baselines on a number of procgen tasks.

### Strengths
The idea is interesting and provides a good way to address one of the shortcomings of TreeQN, namely the complexity of dealing with deep trees. Similarly the application to procgen is good, and departs from the more standard atari tasks, and the experiments do show improvements over the baselines. The combination of the additional loss components is also novel (as far as I am aware) albeit rather straightforward.

### Weaknesses
I have a few criticisms of this work:

(1) The primary contribution (e.g. the mechanism by which nodes are expanded in contrast to TreeQN) while novel, is marginally novel. This is addressing a real problem, but it's not clear by looking at the results that it gives a significant gain, although it clearly does provide gains. The additional minor contributions (e.g. the telescoping variance reduction technique and the CQL loss) are similarly minor. The first follows from other standard procedures for reducing variance for REINFORCE-style algorithms and the second is necessary but is one of a standard family of approaches which addresses the batch-RL setting (see my next point).

(2) It is unclear why the authors are specifically addressing the batch RL setting. It would in my opinion be much more interesting to apply this to the online or at least growing batch setting. When learning the latent transition models and using them to inform how the tree is expanded the use of data from an optimal policy is particularly strong, and potentially more simple techniques based on behavioral cloning could be applied. This adds a new dimension that I'm not sure is necessary to compare against the original technique (and requires more info on how the data is generated, etc.).

(3) Finally while the presentation of the work is reasonable there are a number of points where the the fundamental algorithm being discussed is not quite clear. In particular the pseudocode is only included in the appendix, and even the definition of the loss being optimized (e.g. the TD-error) is only defined in the appendix. Similarly the precise definition of what a node is is unclear, and things like the latent state are represented as h_t or h_n depending on whether this is depth or node. This can be inferred, but this section should be given another pass to make it much more explicit about what the algorithm is doing.

### Questions
See the above. Particularly the first two points, whereas the third is something the authors should definitely address, but I'm fairly confident that they would be able to do so.

Overall I do like the idea, but fundamentally I feel the authors should address the question of why the batch RL setting is the right setting to be making this comparison (e.g. with TreeQN).
