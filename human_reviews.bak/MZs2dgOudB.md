# Exploring Active Learning in Meta-Learning: Enhancing Context Set Labeling

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Most meta-learning methods assume that the (very small) context set used to establish a new task at test time is passively provided.
In some settings, however, it is feasible to actively select which points to label; the potential gain from a careful choice is substantial, but the setting requires major differences from typical active learning setups.
We clarify the ways in which active meta-learning can be used to label a context set, depending on which parts of the meta-learning process use active learning.
Within this framework, we propose a natural algorithm based on fitting Gaussian mixtures for selecting which points to label; though simple, the algorithm also has theoretical motivation.
The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods when used with various meta-learning algorithms across several benchmark datasets.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper focuses on active meta-learning. Firstly, it summarizes different ways of combining active learning with meta learning. Additionally, it suggested a new active learning methods based on Gaussian Mixture Selection for the testing stage of meta learning. The paper presents numerous experiments conducted on real-world datasets, comparing the results with baseline algorithms.

### Strengths
The paper gives a comprehensive summarization of the active selecting context in Meta learning, presentation and notation in this section is clear. 

The paper provides numerous experiment results on both classification and regression problems.

### Weaknesses
The contribution of this paper is incremental. As the paper points out, Gaussian Mixture selection for active learning is not new. Although the paper combines it with meta learning, but the nothing is tailored for meta learning. To me, it simply applies existing algorithms in the testing stage of meta learning. 

Some presentation in this paper is not good. For example, in the introduction, the paper does not explicitly highlight that the proposed method is designed for low budget, especially one-shot learning under an unstratified setting. In section 3.2, the paper proposes to use penultimate layer of the initialization neural net as the features for active context selection, but this important detail is only mentioned midway through that section. 

The choice of Gaussian Mixture Selection is not adequately explained, and the paper fails to discuss its advantages compared to other clustering algorithms.

### Questions
In Figure 2, the caption mentions that the figure depicts mean and standard error, but in the figure itself, it actually represents accuracy.

In proposition 1, it should it be "X|Y =  x~N(mu_y, sigma^2 I)" ? And why this proposition is beneficial for active learning is not fully discussed. 

In Figure 3, why is Gaussian Mixture Selection effective in covering more classes in the one-shot unstratified task? This appears to be a challenging task for unsupervised learning without the aid of labels. How does Gaussian Mixture Selection outperform other competing algorithms in this context?

### Summary
the abstract discusses the concept of active meta-learning, which involves actively selecting which data points to label in the context set during the meta-learning process. A proposed algorithm based on fitting Gaussian mixtures is introduced. The key findings suggest that this algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods when used with various meta-learning algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets. In essence, the study highlights the potential advantages of integrating active learning principles into meta-learning to improve performance

### Strengths
Overall, the motivation of this paper is very interetsting to use active learning to save the label cost in meta learning. This paper summarize the difference of current related work and clarify their difference. I appreciated the conducted experiments.

### Weaknesses
The technique novelty is too limited. The introduced algrithm is very simple based on normal distribution. So, the overal paper looks more like a technique report or a survey.

### Questions
If the algorithm is theoretically motivated, why is there no theories or lemmas in the mainbody?

____
After rebuttal: I appreciate the author's response and added experiments. I would suggest adding more theoretical analysis to the main body for a simple method and moving a part of related work to the Appendix. Some short-paper tracks may be more suitable for this paper.

### Summary
This paper studies the effectiveness of active learning in the meta-learning setting.  The authors first discuss the different ways active-learning can be applied to meta-learning including actively selecting data to label at training and test time as well as actively selecting tasks to train on.  Experiments with using active learning to select labeled data at meta-training time showed no benefit over uniform sampling so the authors focus on active labeling at meta-test time.  Here, they
propose a simple Gausian Mixture Model to identify highest-density points to label.  Experiments show GMM to outperform other labeling approaches at meta-test time on multiple computer vision meta-learning benchmarks.

### Strengths
- Active learning at meta-test time is a novel problem to study; prior work I am aware of have primarily focused on active learning during meta-training phase.
- Experimental results for GMM for active-learning at test time are quite strong compared to other approaches.
- Good coverage of meta-learning approaches including metric (ProtoNet), optimization (MAML), and model (Baseline++) type approaches.
- The paper is clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- Missing reference to [Al-Shedivant et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00127.pdf).  This paper studies active learning for meta-learning at training time and proposes a hybrid informative and diverse clustering labeling approach using k-means++.  I encourage the authors to include this active learning approach as an additional baseline in their experiments.
- Limited technical novelty since theory and approach are straightforward.  However, I am not placing too much weight on this since experimental results are strong.
- The paper can benefit from a discussion of practical implications of being able to be more label-efficient at meta-test time grounded in a real-world example.
- Theoretical justification is very basic and presumed to hold in meta-learning case with ad-hoc justification.

### Questions
- For Tables 1, 2, 3, how many runs are used to compute error bars?
- Is there a hypothesis for why GMM helps at test time but not at meta-train time?  This is an important discrepancy that is worth understanding deeper.

### Summary
This paper introduces an approach that integrates active learning into meta-learning with the goal of enhancing data efficiency when selecting context points during the meta-testing phase. The paper starts with an analysis of where in the meta-learning process active learning can be applied, along with a concise review of meta-learning and active learning methods. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate that actively selecting context points during meta-training does not significantly impact meta-learning but does prove beneficial during meta-testing. In this context, the authors propose a Gaussian Mixture Model-based acquisition function, which stands as the primary technical contribution of this paper. In essence, this method employs meta-trained features to model a mixture of k Gaussian distributions, with k equating to the label budget, often referred to as batch size in active learning. The empirical results, based on experiments conducted across four few-shot image datasets, indicate that the proposed GMM-based acquisition strategy outperforms other acquisition strategies when integrated into meta-testing.

### Strengths
Originality: While the concept of integrating active learning into meta-learning is interesting, it's worth noting that this idea, at a high level, has been explored before. However, the authors' empirical findings regarding the placement of active learning align with existing research, indicating that actively selecting context points during meta-training does not significantly improve few-shot performance. The use of an acquisition function based on a mixture of Gaussians has demonstrated effective performance across various few-shot classification tasks.

Clarity: The paper effectively communicates its main ideas. The explanation of how active learning can be incorporated into meta-learning is well-presented and offers valuable guidance for practical applications.

Significance: The proposed method, utilizing a GMM-based acquisition strategy, has exhibited promising results when compared to several acquisition strategies employed in active learning. This achievement is particularly noteworthy across multiple few-shot image classification and vision regression datasets.

### Weaknesses
The primary technical contribution of this paper lies in the GMM-based acquisition function, which is suggested to outperform other acquisition functions in scenarios with extremely limited annotation budgets, as required by meta-learning. However, the results presented in Figure 2 do not convincingly demonstrate a substantial performance improvement of the proposed GMM-Based method over Typiclust.

Furthermore, selecting the samples close to the cluster centre can better capture the diversity. However, it's important to note that several hybrid active learning approaches already consider both uncertainty and diversity. For example, BEMPS [1] integrates these aspects. To better highlight the advantages of the proposed methods, a more comprehensive examination within the context of active learning is advisable.

### Questions
The reviewer has a question about the setup of active learning in meta-testing. 
Was the acquisition just run to acquire N*K samples?  Or was the acquisition run multiple times until the total annotation budget N*K was exhausted? If the later case, was the meta-trained model retrained after each acquisition iteration? And what was the batch size (No. Samples acquired) used in each iteration?
