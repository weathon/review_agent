- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
This paper studies the problem of distributed multi-agent Bayesian optimization with both coupled black-box constraints and known affine constraints. A primal-dual distributed algorithm is proposed that achieves similar regret/violation bounds as those in the single-agent case for the black-box objective and constraint functions. Additionally, the algorithm guarantees an $\mathcal{O}(N\sqrt{T})$ bound on the cumulative violation for the known affine constraints, where $N$ is the number of agents. Hence, it is ensured that the average of the samples satisfies the affine constraints up to the error $\mathcal{O}(N/\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, we characterize certain conditions under which our algorithm can bound a stronger metric of cumulative violation and provide best-iterate convergence without affine constraint. The method is then applied to both sampled instances from Gaussian processes and a real-world optimal power allocation problem for wireless communication; the results show that our method simultaneously provides close-to-optimal performance and maintains minor violations on average, corroborating our theoretical analysis.

### Summary
This paper studies an extension of a recent paper by [Zhou and Ji (NeurIPS 2022)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html) on constrained Gaussian process optimization (equivalently, constrained black-box bayesian optimization, constrained kernelized bandit optimization). In particular, the extension assumes that the objective $f$ is given by $f(x) = \sum_{I=1}^N f_i(x_i)$ where $x=(x_1,\ldots, x_N)^\top$ and the constraint function $g$ is given by $g(x) = \sum_{I=1}^N g_i(x_i)$ where $x=(x_1,\ldots, x_N)^\top$. The setting here is referred to as *multi-agent* in the paper in that individual agent $i\in [N]$ makes its decision $x_i$. Moreover, there exists an affine constraint $\sum_{i=1}^N A_i x_i = b$ that couples the individual decisions $x_1,\ldots, x_N$. Here, the basic idea is to dualize the affine constraint to decouple the decisions $x_1,\ldots, x_N$. Then one may apply the drift-based primal-dual method of [Zhou and Ji (NeurIPS 2022)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html) developed for the single-agent setting to optimize the individual decisions.

### Strengths
* The paper proposes an extension of the existing single-agent constrained black-box optimization framework to a multi-agent setting with a joint affine constraint. 
* Numerical results demonstrate the soundness of the proposed framework on some applications.

### Weaknesses
* Although the distributed multi-agent framework proposed in this paper has meaningful applications in practice, the technical contribution of the paper seems marginal. The main component of the algorithm developed in this paper relies on the method by [Zhou and Ji (NeurIPS 2022)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html), and the primal-dual technique to deal with the joint affine constraint as well as the aggregated constraint function is standard. The most important part to derive the performance guarantees is basically done by the work of [Zhou and Ji (NeurIPS 2022)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html) for the single-agent setting.
* It is a restriction that the functions of individual agents $(f_1,g_1),\ldots, (f_N, g_N)$ come from independent Gaussian processes.

### Questions
Is it possible to consider more complex interactions between agents? It might be a too strong assumption that the functions of individual agents $(f_1,g_1),\ldots, (f_N, g_N)$ come from independent Gaussian processes. Is it possible to study the setting where $f=(f_1,\ldots, f_N)$ and $g=(g_1,\ldots,g_N)$ follow a joint Gaussian process?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of online distributed multi-agent Bayesian optimization with both coupled black-box constraints and known affine equation constraints. To solve this problem, the author/s propose a primal-dual distributed algorithm, which is proven to achieve similar regret and constraint violation bounds as those in the single-agent case. The paper also examines certain conditions under which a stronger metric of cumulative violation is bounded and provide best-iterate convergence without affine constraint. The examples also show the effective of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The proposed algorithm is the first distributed multi-agent BO algorithm that has theoretical regret and constraint violation bounds.
2. The author/s also examine certain conditions under which the proposed algorithm could upper bound the cumulative constraint violation in sub-linear.
3. There are two examples showing the algorithm's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
Although the proposed algorithm is the first online distributed multi-agent BO method with theoretical regret and constraint violation bounds guarantee, both the algorithm and the analysis are direct extension of the previous algorithm in single-agent case like the Zhou & Ji, 2022 and Srinivas et al., 2012. The author/s claim that the added affine equation constraint would lead to more challenging analysis, but to the best of my knowledge after checking the proof of Theorem 1, I could not see much challenge besides analyzing the potential function of the two terms separately instead of doing it together. And this separate analysis does not look as challenging as it sounds.

=========== After author/s feedback ===============
Thanks the author/s to spend lots of time addressing my novelty concern especially the technical contribution about the analysis for the added affine equation constraint. I agree with other reviewers on the additional complexity that the affine equation constraint brings and would like to increase my score from 3 to 5.

### Summary
This paper proposes the first algorithm for distributed multi-agent Bayesian optimization with both black-box and known affine constraints. The proposed method is based on the primal-dual decomposition, which naturally gives rise to separated local primal update of the input queries and global dual update of the dual variables. The paper analyzes both the regret and the cumulative violations of both constraints, and applies the method to an experiment with know affine constraints.

### Strengths
- The paper identifies a new problem, proposes a natural algorithm based on the primal-dual formulation, and performs rigorous analysis of the algorithm in terms of both the regrets and constraint violations.
- The paper gives real-world motivating examples when introducing different components of the problem setting, such as problems where black-box constraints and know affine constraints can occur (for example, the top paragraph of page 2).

### Weaknesses
- There is a related line of work on federated Bayesian optimization ([1,2] below) and federated kernelized bandits [3,4] which should be discussed (perhaps in the Introduction). In fact, the problem setting of multi-agent BO shares many similarities with federated BO/kernelized bandits, including both the first point (the agents do not share the local observations) and second point (the function evaluations are done locally) discussed in the bottom paragraph of page 1. These previous works may not diminish the novelty of the current paper though, because as far as I know, no prior federated BO/kernelized bandit papers have considered constraints.

- The paper did give some real-world scenarios with black-box constraints and know affine constraints, however, are there use cases with both types of constraints? The experiments section also only has one experiment with only known affine constraints, so I think it will be helpful to apply the method to an experiment with both types of constraints.
- I think the example given at the top of page 5 can be further clarified.
- Theorem 1: I think some discussions regarding the differences between the two cases would be helpful. Regarding the dependency on $\sum^N_{i=1}\sum^m_{j=1}\gamma^T_{i,j}$, if we substitute in the rate of $\gamma$ for either the SE kernel and Matern kernel, I guess this term would depend linearly on $N$ and $m$? If this is the case, then for case 1 of Theorem 1, the first term in the regret bound would have a dependency of $N^2$ and $m$. Also, it is mentioned in the paragraph below Theorem 1 that "we can trade violation for smaller regret", I think some elaborations would be helpful.
- Remark 4: if I understand correctly, the assumption $\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\sum^N_{i=1}\sum^m_{j=1}\gamma^T_{i,j} / \sqrt{T} = 0$ holds for the Matern kernel only when the function is smooth?
- Figure 1: I agree that the strong violation of the proposed DMABO grows slower and slower yet the baseline of DCEI suffers from linear growth, but in this figure, the strong violations of DMABO is always larger than DCEI. It seems the relative magnitude is only reversed when the number of steps is large enough.
