- Decision: Accept (oral)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Climate and weather prediction traditionally relies on complex numerical simulations of atmospheric physics. Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a  spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art.

### Summary
ClimODE aims to improve climate prediction by integrating physical principles into a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. Unlike traditional black-box models, ClimODE incorporates the concept of advection from statistical mechanics, ensuring that the model considers the spatial movement of weather quantities over time. The model employs neural ODEs to model the weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics. The architecture includes components for local convolutions and global attention, allowing it to capture both local and global weather influences. ClimODE also addresses uncertainty in predictions and source variations through a probabilistic emission model. This feature allows the model to quantify prediction uncertainties and adapt to various source variations. ClimODE is reported to outperform existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting.

### Strengths
1. Physics-Informed Modeling: ClimODE incorporates physical principles, ensuring that the model aligns with our first-principle understanding of the meteorological dynamics. ClimODE follows the partial differential continuity equation and solves a latent equation in such a form, and this makes both the physical insights and model training easier to understand and follow. Because of the use of Neural ODE, the prediction would be continuous in spacetime. I like the cute and nice idea.

2. Model Design: The use of both local convolutions and global attention allows the model to capture a wide range of influences on weather patterns, enhancing its predictive capabilities with both locality inductive bias and long-term interaction capability. The model’s ability to quantify uncertainty and/or model source variation is an additional advantage, making its forecasts more reliable and comprehensive (like a latent force). The spatio-temporal embedding also gives the model extra power to reflect the geographical differences with spatial-temporal variation, which makes a lot of sense.

3. Performance and Efficiency: ClimODE achieves superior performance over some existing deep learning weather forecasting models, with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, making it computationally efficient. 

4. Presentation: Very clear description of initial condition modeling, PDE to ODE modeling, Advection and Flow Velocity modeling, etc.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited Performance and Comparison: The proposed model, although surpasses vanilla Neural ODE and ClimaX, still cannot compete with IFS (ECMWF NWP), let alone bigger models such as FourCastNet and Pangu-Weather that have already reported better results than NWP. There lacks enough comparison to other models in general, such as Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (practiced by FourcastNet), previous weather forecasting methods like [1, 2], even models for similar tasks such as spatio-temporal traffic forecasting or video forecasting, etc. Comparison to Neural ODE is more of an ablation study and ClimaX is a weak baseline marginally better than ResNet. Comparing only with ClimaX is definitely not convincing enough. 

2. Limited Physical Complexity: The partial differential continuity equation is indeed a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics as it describes how quantities such as mass, moisture, or energy are transported and conserved in the atmosphere over time and space. What makes it less predictive in the real world is that this equation comes with assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of the fluid. In cases where these assumptions are violated, the equation might not hold perfectly. I am not certain whether relying too much on this physical equation would be optimal for modeling the complex dynamics of weather, especially in finer-granular resolution with more weather factors and potentially larger noises. 

3. Limited Physical Understanding: In all, the partial differential continuity equation is a general-form conservation equation rather than any specific equations explaining each weather factor. Other than that, because neural ODE is essentially still a black-box model due to using neural network, it remains hard to know, for example, the relationships and the interactions between different weather variables.

### Questions
If the several ideas behind ClimODE is effective as suggested by the ablation study, I would really be interested to see its performance in a large model compared to Pangu or FourcastNet, for example. Those benchmarks are exceptional since they excel NWP results in many cases and have been tested/used even for recent disaster predictions. It is just like the LLM that, if it becomes powerful enough, everyone will be amazed and will use it. If the ultimate goal of this paper is to propose a strong SOTA model against existing models, it is strongly recommended to compare with those large models and consider adapting to this line in the future research. 

Since the paper mentions efficiency, I wonder how does the model perform with more parameters. Would the performance increase? Or, it is more like a nice small model to save us from excessive computational burden?

Are there any reasons why ClimODE performs worse than ClimaX in t2m? 

How does the model perform with long-term prediction, say, for 7 days or 14 days? The authors mention the emission source model as a strong inductive bias that prevents long-horizon forecast collapses and it seems to work based on the ablation study, so I wonder that.

### Summary
The authors present ClimODE, a new method for weather forecasting that provides uncertainty esimates, benchmarked on ERA5 data from WeatherBench. This method is based on first principles from physics, namely the *continuity equation* which mathematically formulates that in a system, quantities are conserved (modulo any sources/sinks). Neural ODEs are used to model the continuity PDE and the flow velocity is parametrized using a neural net that has two components: A CNN that models local interactions and an attention mechanism that model long-range interactions. Furthermore, an emission model is added on top that serves to estimate first and second order moments of the true underlying solution (bias and uncertainty). 

ClimODE greatly outperforms the baseline NODE which doesn't take into account the physical principles of advection nor does it correct its solution by the proposed emisison models, moreover, ClimODE also outperform ClimaX, one of the recent state-of-the-art weather forecasting models on the regridded 5.625 ° ERA5 data.

Finally, strong ablation study results are shown that indicate the important role of taking into account the underlying physical principles as well as the emission model.

### Strengths
- Proposed method that is based on first principles from physics and provides interpretability of the solution: i.e. explicit transport, compression and flow velocity terms.
- Provides efficient uncertainty estimation by learning the bias and the standard deviation, unlike previous methods that have to rely on ensembling which is computationally intensive.
- Simple model, but still manages to outperform ClimaX which would make this method not only a strong baseline for future work but also a method to quickly iterate on and improve.
- Strong ablation studies demonstrating the design choices made by ClimODE over NODE as well as the effect of the emission model.

### Weaknesses
- "Closed system assumption implies value-preserving manifold" is unclear and needs more justification. While the conclusion that: $$\mathbb{E}_x[u_k(\mathbf{x},t)]=\text{const.}$$

sounds intuitive, it's not justified rigourously. The expectation is taken with respect to which density? I would expect the quantity to be preserved would be $\int_{\Omega} u_k(\mathbf{x},t)dV$, since that's the total quantity over the whole "volume" you're considering which should be preserved (e.g. when $u_k=\rho$, the integral over the volume becomes the mass). In any case, since this is a Machine Learning submission, it would be better if this part is thoroughly justified. 

- Benchmark only up to 36 hours while state-of-the-art methods reported results for up to 10 days ahead. The paper would be better if it reported results for at least five or seven days ahead.
- Authors mention that other deep learning methods lacked open-source code, while that's true for PanguWeather (who only provide a pseudo-code "implementation"), it's not for the others:
    - FourCastNet: https://github.com/NVlabs/FourCastNet
    - GraphCast: https://github.com/google-deepmind/graphcast

 Given that GraphCast seem to outperform ClimaX, it would have been good to compare against it as well and also FourCastNet since it's one of the first papers to perform weather forecasting on such a scale.
- Authors claim that the vaue-preserving manifold (that emanates from the closed system assumption), presents a strong inductive bias for long-term forecasts, yet, using Euler scheme to solve the ODE is known to be unstable and it'll especially not conserve the quantity we want preserved, so that inductive bias is no longer enforced. It would be better to include that limitation in the paper and acknowledge that while it is a strong inductive bias, it's hard to enforce in practice. This is further seen from Table 2 which shows that the error does increase dramatically with lead time and that suggests that ClimODE is better at inferring the true physics but not in mitigating the error propagation in long-term forecasts.
- While Figure 6 shows qualitatively the soundness of the predicted bias and variance, there's no quantitative approach that evaluates the quality of the bias and variance output by the model. A metric like CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score) can showcase that.

### Questions
- Table 1 says that NowCastNet doesn't provide uncertainty estimation, but it's a generative model which can provide such estimates and in general approximate the true underlying distribution.
- In section 3.2, it's unclear why $\mathbf{\dot{v}}_k(\mathbf{x}, t) = \ddot{u}_k(x,t)$, especially when $\ddot{u}_k(x,t)$ is not a vector.
- In section 3.6, how is $\tilde{\dot{u}}(t_0)$ numerically apprixmated from past states?
- Why not use different time-resolutions for solving the ODE and assessing their effect? Same goes for the ODE-solver. Given that you state that Runge-Kutta can be used with a low computational cost, it would add more quality to the paper overall if you include it as well.
- How long does it take to train?
- Lacks training details for ClimaX as well as the training runtimes and number of GPUs used for ClimaX.

### Summary
This paper proposes ClimODE, a novel climate modeling approach that leverages physics-based constraints. It represents climate dynamics as a continuous-time advection process governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The PDEs are discretized into ODEs using the method of lines, with the velocity field modeled by a neural network integrating convolutions and attention. Gaussian emission models estimate the prediction uncertainties and source variations. Empirically, ClimODE outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting tasks, highlighting the efficacy of continuous-time physical constraints.

### Strengths
1. **Physical Prior as the Foundation:** 
   The paper ingeniously grounds its methodology in the continuity equation, a well-established physical prior. This not only lends an elegant formulation but also ensures an interpretable and efficient model. The fair integration of this physical prior into the deep model showcases an exemplary fusion of the first principles with modern DL techniques.

2. **Gaussian Emission Model:** 
   The adoption of the Gaussian as an emission model is both impressive and reasonable. It aptly addresses uncertainties and unknown sources in climate forecasting, offering a reasonable approach to handling the inherent unpredictability of the domain.

3. **Experimentation and Insight:** 
   The experimental setup and investigation presented in the work are both rigorous and enlightening. The thoroughness of the research provides valuable insights and sets an easy-to-access benchmark for future endeavors in the field.

Also, the presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. For the model of FLOW VELOCITY (section 3.2), as we already know $\dot{\mathbf{v}}_k(\mathrm{x}, t) = \ddot{u}_k(\mathrm{x}, t)$,   why we still need to parameterize it? Is it because the computation of $\ddot{u}_k(\mathrm{x}, t)$ is too costly? There are also many methods that could approximate $\ddot{u}_k(\mathrm{x}, t)$ based on $\dot{u}_k(\mathrm{x}, t)$. More discussion or claims are encouraged. 

2. The model treats the advection PDE as independent for each task or quantity. However, in the intricate tapestry of climate dynamics, various quantities are interdependent. For instance, wind patterns can influence temperature fluctuations.  The paper doesn't clearly illustrate how the proposed method addresses these inherent inter-correlations.

This paper introduces ClimODE, a neural ODE combining a convolutional local mechanism and a global attention mechanism to predict one timestep of weather evolution. It uses ERA5 data from WeatherBench 1 and compares it to ClimaX model and against a standard Neural ODE.

### Strengths
Originality
- First NeuralODE work applied to this problem
- Extending Neural ODEs to be more effective for the specific climate problem

Quality
- High-quality writing, figures
- Using relevant, real-world data for evaluation

Clarity
- Written well and understandable
- Detailed explanations

Significance
- Satisfies the need for ML climate models to be value-conserving and have a probabilistic forecast
- Contributes towards faster climate and weather modeling, potentially using less computational resources

### Weaknesses
- A couple of Figures (e.g Figure 5) would benefit from a longer caption/description
- Not comparing against state-of-the-art methods, such as GraphCast
- It should be compared against pre-trained ClimaX or other methods that don't require pre-training

### Questions
1. What do you mean by one-shot GAN referring to Ravuri et al., 2021? Is there any pre-training involved
2. There is Weatherbench 2 available now, maybe to recent to be included in this submission, but should be mentioned in future work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15560, https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/
3. Are any of the competing methods such as GraphCast, PanguWeather, FourCastNet that now available?
4. Is the comparison against ClimaX fair? The main idea of ClimaX is to use pre-training, but you state you use all methods without pertaining
5. The statement "IFS is still far ahead of any deep learning method" doesn't really hold anymore, e.g.: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10128.pdf
6. Kreislers GNN work should be mentioned here as well: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07575.pdf
7. This work could be useful too: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04664.pdf
