# Learning to Play Atari in a World of Tokens

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
Model-based reinforcement learning agents utilizing transformers have shown improved sample efficiency due to their ability to model extended context, resulting in more accurate world models.
However, for complex reasoning and planning tasks, these methods primarily rely on continuous representations.
This complicates modeling of discrete properties of the real world such as disjoint object classes between which interpolation is not plausible.
In this work, we introduce discrete abstract representations for transformer-based learning (DART), a sample-efficient method utilizing discrete representations for modeling both the world and learning behavior. We incorporate a transformer-decoder for auto-regressive world modeling and a transformer-encoder for learning behavior by attending to task-relevant cues in the discrete representation of the world model. For handling partial observability, we aggregate information from past time steps as memory tokens.  
DART outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that do not use look-ahead search on the Atari 100k sample efficiency benchmark with a median human-normalized score of 0.790 and beats humans in 9 out of 26 games.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use a transformer-based architecture for world modeling and policy learning. In addition, it uses VQ-VAE to obtain discrete representations of the observation and memory tokens to handle partial observability. Results on Atari 100k show the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that do not use look-ahead search.

### Strengths
* The paper proposes a transformer-based architecture for world modeling and policy learning and shows it's quite effective on Atari 100k.
* The paper conducts extensive experiments on Atari 100k and provides many metrics to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
* The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
* From the results in Table 1, DART is worse than DreamerV3 on multiple games. Also, DreamerV3's results are missing from the figures.
* It would be better to evaluate DART's performance on multiple domains, such as robotic control, Crafter, DMLab, or even Minecraft, to show the discrete representations can generalize to different scenarios.
* It seems like the core contribution of the paper is from the architecture side. However, there are also many prior works that leverage the transformer architecture for world modeling. It would be good to clarify the novelties of this work and how the work differs from prior works. A system-level comparison table would be helpful.

### Questions
What's the reason for using an image-based VQ-VAE instead of a video-based VQ-VAE?

### Summary
This paper introduced discrete representation to transformer-based model-based RL. The world model is learned with a transformer-decoder. Unlike work, the policy is learned from the transformer-encoder, where self-attention can aggregate information. To handle situations where long-term dependency is required, the proposed method introduced a special memory token to pass information from a few steps ago. Experiments on Atari 100K showed improved median human-normalized scores.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The ablation study provided in the paper is well-designed and informative.

### Weaknesses
- I need more clarification about the motivation that long-range dependencies impede Dreamers learning. Could the authors provide experiments comparing the world model accuracy among the proposed method and prior non-transformer-based methods on some long-range tasks?
- I think the world model accuracy should be measured more in detail (i.e. future states predicting accuracy. reward predicting accuracy, etc.) to fully support the author's arguments on the RNN-based world model and Transformer-based world model.
- Could the authors also compare the model capacity among DART and other baselines?
- Could the authors explain how the long-term dependencies are required in Atari tasks?
- Could the authors please provide the value set for some critical hyper-params? i.e. What is the value of $K$? How long is the Transformer horizon set? 
- The MEM token compresses all past information into one vector, similar to the RNN hidden states. Could the authors explain why MEM helps?
- Could the authors also include the STORM[1] paper to compare and explain the advantages of DART over STORM?
- Could the authors add one ablation study on DART with continuous representation?

### Summary
This paper introduces a model-based RL method to learn to play atari in a sample-efficient manner (100k environment interactions). The basic approach of this paper is similar to various MBRL papers wherein they first learn a state representation followed by learning the dynamics of the environment which is followed by learning the policy in the imagined environment. In this paper, the above 3 steps are carried out as follows:

- Representation learning: The proposed method learn a discrete representation of the state space using a vq-gan style approach. Each frame is encoded to K tokens from a codebook.

- Dynamics learning: The proposed method utilize a transformer to learning the dynamics. The dynamics learning is comprised of 3 objectives - (1) predicting next token given the previous tokens, (2) predicting the reward for each frame, (3) predicting whether the episode has ended.

- Policy learning: The proposed method use actor-critic to learn the policy. The policy is parametrized as a ViT encoder which takes as input - (1) A cls token, (2) A set of codes from a particular frame, (3) A mem token which aggregates information from past frames. The output corresponding to the CLS token is used to output the action and the value. The output corresponding to the mem token is used as input the ViT for the next frame. 

They show that their approach results in state-of-the art performance across 26 atari games when measuring median performance. Furthermore, they present various ablations such as visualizing the attention matrix of the policy and evaluating the model without various components such as positional embeddings, exploration, mem token etc.

### Strengths
- The main strength of this paper is in the clarity of the idea and the presentation. The paper combines various existing approaches and combines them in a way that is not too complicated to understand or implement. 

- The novelty over the previous approach with discrete tokens - IRIS -  lies in being able to learn a policy on latent states rather than on reconstructed observations as done in IRIS. The advantage of not using reconstructed observations is that it is a lot more computationally efficient to use the latent states directly.

### Weaknesses
These are not weakness per se, but the reviewer thinks In these respects paper can be improved:

- The approach is simple (which is good) and integrates components used by the model already exist in literature. Learning a world models on discrete tokens has been previously introduced in IRIS and using a ViT policy (which the authors claim to be their main novelty) head has been studied by Yoon et al 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04419). Usage of a memory token to feed past context has also been studied in Bulatov et al 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06881), Didolkar et al 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14794), Moudgil et al 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14143). I would suggest to include these works in the introduction and recontextualize the work based on the above works.

- The results dont seem strong enough. The model only differs from IRIS in the policy and in many games IRIS still performs better. Secondly, according to the IRIS paper, they achieve superhuman performance in 10 games while in Table 1 it says 9 games and DART also achieves superhuman performance in 9 games. Therefore, IRIS actually can outperform humans in more games than DART hence the usefulness of of the ViT policy is not very apparent. It would be nice to see a section where the authors compare DART to only IRIS and try to study in more detail the importance of the ViT policy. Figure 3b compares DART to each approach individually but I am not sure how these probabilities are calculated. Can the authors clarify this?

[More of a comment than a weakness]. While the current paper and the baselines study the performance in a setting where the model is limited to 100k interactions, I think it would still be useful to compare how these approaches scale with more interactions and whether the current trends still hold with more interactions.
