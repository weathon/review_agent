# SoundStorm: Efficient Parallel Audio Generation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3, 8

## Abstract
Modeling the tokens of a neural audio codec unlocked rapid progress in audio generation, producing high-quality, coherent audio. However, this approach requires modeling long sequences, thus affecting the training and inference costs. In this work, we propose SoundStorm, a model for efficient, parallel audio generation, which scales gracefully to long sequences without compromising the quality of the generated audio. SoundStorm receives as input coarse, discrete audio representations, and relies on bidirectional attention and confidence-based parallel decoding to sample the tokens of a neural audio codec. Compared to the autoregressive generation approach of AudioLM, our model produces audio of the same quality and with higher consistency in voice and acoustic conditions, while being two orders of magnitude faster. SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We also demonstrate the ability of our model to synthesize high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers’ voices.

### Summary
The paper proposes a parallel-decoding approach called SoundStorm for generating acoustic tokens given semantic conditional signals or speaker prompts. The core is an extension of the MaskGIT in the scenarios of multiple residual vector-quantizers and in the audio domain. The experiments show that the proposed non-autoregressive method could run faster at the inference stage than previous multi-stage acoustic tokens modeling.

### Strengths
1) Using parallel decoding for audio generation is promising and demanding due to the length and RVQs. It will be a growing field shortly.
2) The audio samples in supplementary material are well done.
3) In general, the paper is straightforward to understand.

### Weaknesses
1) Technical novelty is quite limited. The masking and decoding algorithms are adapted from MaskGIT. Probably the main difference is that SoundStorm enables the mask on multiple RVQ levels.
2) It is okay if the simple adaptation works the best, but it requires more experiments and comparisons to show that. The current baseline comparisons are very limited. What about the other autoregressive methods mentioned in the related work, like VALL-E and delayed patterns? There is not even comparison to the basic masking approach that masks tokens at arbitrary time steps and RVQ levels randomly. The VampNet could achieve reasonable results with a simple masking approach to music generation.
3) It seems like the speaker prompts highly influence the quality metrics (WER, CER, audio quality). I am not sure why it has to be the case that no tokens of the prompt are masked during training.
4) It is unclear why Conformer is being used instead of the same architecture as AudioLM; no comparison is shown.
5) Reproducibility: most of the components in the proposed approach and even baseline AudioLM are not open-source. While I understand this is not controllable for certain reasons, more implementation details, e.g., optimizers, learning rate, batch size, the cross-entropy loss when convergence, etc., should be included in the paper so that there is a higher chance of reproducing the results and have a fair comparison for future work.

### Questions
Besides questions mentioned in weaknesses,
1) The number of RVQ levels affects the number of heads. Usually, more heads take more time to converge. Are there any insights into the relationship between the number of RVQ levels and the convergence in the training?
2) How important are the conditional semantic tokens in the proposed method? Would it still be possible to train with other types of semantic tokens?

### Summary
The paper introduces SoundStorm, an iterative generative method for semantic-to-acoustic audio tokens generation. It employs the MaskGIT decoding scheme for residual vector quantized tokens. In comparison to the autoregressive (AR) approach of AudioLM, SoundStorm produces audio of comparable quality. Additionally, it offers increased consistency in voice and acoustic conditions, while achieving sampling speeds that are two orders of magnitude faster.

### Strengths
* The proposed method not only matches the audio quality of a state-of-the-art autoregressive method but also excels in intelligibility, voice preservation, acoustic consistency, and sampling speed.
* The authors successfully apply the MaskGIT method to the residual vector quantization (RVQ) in the speech domain.

### Weaknesses
The performance evaluation focuses solely on SoundStream tokenization and only offers a comparison with AudioLM. While the superiority over stages 2 and 3 of AudioLM is evident, the paper does not elucidate the proposed method's applicability to other neural audio codecs or how it compares with other generative methods. It would be beneficial to explore its viability with tokenization methods other than SoundStream and to contrast it with other generative methods. For instance, comparing it with the hybrid approach of VALL-E, which employs autoregressive modeling at the first level of RVQ and non-autoregressive modeling in subsequent levels, or evaluating against non-autoregressive methods like diffusion [1] or flow-matching [2], could help illuminate potential trade-offs.

### Questions
Although the samples in the supplementary material exhibit generation diversity, is there a way to verify that this diversity stems from the proposed method rather than the semantic token generator? In other words, exploring the diversity of samples generated from the same semantic tokens would also be an interesting aspect of this research.

### Summary
This paper introduces an approach to efficient parallel audio generation. The authors leverage bidirectional attention and confidence-based parallel decoding to sample the tokens of a neural audio codec. Compared to AR approaches, SoundStorm is much more efficient while preserving generation quality.

### Strengths
This paper proposes an efficient and high-quality generation diagram for neural audio codec token generation. Compared with the auto-regressive generation, SoundStorm successfully addresses the high-latency issue while enjoying the same quality and even more consistency.

The samples in supplementary material show impressive generation performance, especially the dialogue generation.

### Weaknesses
1)	The experiments are not convincing. The authors only compare the proposed SoundStorm with the AudioLM baseline. However, there are many works such as VALL-E [1] and NaturalSpeech 2 [2] successfully addressed the high-quality zero-shot TTS task. More comparison and discussion should be included to demonstrate the generation performance. Furthermore, prosody is also an important aspect of generation quality. Evaluation of prosody should also be conducted.

2)	The human evaluation should be more detailed. In this paper, only MOS is reported. To measure the generation similarity, SMOS results should be reported. 

3)	In the human evaluation test (Table 2), the author uses ground-truth semantic tokens, which is not fair for baselines.

4)	Some details are missing to reproduce the results easily.
a)	What are your temperature and top-k values for sampling masked position and sampling tokens in a confidence-based sampling scheme?
b)	Do the “mask” tokens in different RVQ layers share the same embedding?

5)	Related work coverage: Some works such as NaturalSpeech 2 [2] also use an efficient framework (latent diffusion) to model the tokens of neural audio codecs.

### Questions
Firstly, please refer to the Weaknesses part to see most of my questions.

1)	In addition, since SoundStorm is a more efficient and high-quality alternative compared with auto-regressive approaches, I have the following questions:
a)	Can SoundStorm maintain the features of the prompt such as the acoustic environment and the speaker’s emotion?
b)	Since SoundStorm has a sampling mechanism in the acoustic token generation, have you tried the diversity of generated speeches? For example, an AR model can generate different prosody while preserving similar timbre, content, etc.
c)	How does the prompt length affect the generation quality?

2)	Some questions for Table 1:
a)	The WavLM similarity for Codec reconstruction is 0.63 – 0.66, which is low. Does it mean the Codec reconstruction quality is not good?
b)	For Voice preservation and Acoustic consistency results with a speaker prompt setting, do you use a prompt reconstructed by audio codec as an evaluation reference or an original prompt (which means the reference prompt is not constructed by codec)?

### Summary
This paper proposes to combine the Conformer model architecture (Gulati et al., 2020) with a coarse-to-fine MaskGIT modeling objective (Chang et al., 2022) and apply these methods to model residual quantized representations of audio. This system (collectively called SoundStorm) enables efficient sampling of (long) tokenized audio sequences. Quantitatively, sampling is 2 orders of magnitude faster than baseline autoregressive sampling from the AudioLM (a causally masked autoregressive transformer). A SoundStorm model is trained on the LibriLight dataset for speech synthesis. The quality of this model compares favorably vs. the baseline AudioLM according to automatic eval metrics (Table 1) and human evaluation (Table 2).

### Strengths
The experiments convincingly demonstrate that this model outperforms the quality of the baseline AudioLM, with dramatically faster sampling. The decoding steps ablation (Figure 3) is helpful for understanding the tradeoff between sample quality and inference time for this family of models. This tradeoff seems quite favorable, becoming only mildly worse at longer sequence lengths (some dependence on sequence in the quality/iterations tradeoff is to be expected).

### Weaknesses
The paper does not articulate a clear contribution. Both the modeling objective (MaskGIT) as well as the architecture (Conformer) are borrowed from previous work; combining these two ideas in itself does not seem like a particularly significant contribution.

There appears to be some novelty in the proposed masking scheme, but the decisions behind this proposal are not thoroughly discussed or empirically ablated. The description of the masking protocol itself is a little hard to follow, in part because the RQV tokenization is never formally defined.

The only empirical comparison to other audio models is AudioLM. I wouldn't consider this a weakness in itself, but given the lack of substantive modeling contributions, I might expect to see a more thorough evaluation. How does SoundStorm compare to, e.g., AudioGen? Is the claim that SoundStorm is simply in a class of its own as far as quality & efficient inference is concerned? If this is indeed the claim, then it could be articulated more clearly with a direct comparison to another NAR speech generation model.

I'm not sure what to make of the results on dialogue synthesis. There is no effort to evaluate these results, merely a pointer to the supplemental material. I'm happy to attest that the supplement results do sound nice, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this section or how it fits into the broader claimed contributions of the paper; this reads more like a product advertisement than a rigorous study.

### Questions
Do the authors plan to release trained SoundStorm model weights? The clearest contribution of this paper is the model artifact itself; if this model is going to be released then that would help to clarify the contribution of this paper to the community.

### Summary
This paper proposed a parallel audio generation method called SoundStorm which produces high quality coherent speech signals while reducing the generation time two orders of magnitude compared to the autoregressive-based audio generation method AudioLM. This method makes the long audio generation feasible. The proposed method is inspired by an image generation algorithm MaskGIT which has been demonstrated effective for image generation. SoundStorm performs parallel decoding for each RVQ layer to generate the SoundStream codec tokens, proceeding from lower coarse layers to higher finer layers, layer by layer. Conformer layers are applied to model the temporal correlation of the acoustic embeddings. Within each RVQ layer, multiple iterations of inference are performed to estimate the masked portions gradually until all the tokens are estimated. For each iteration, the masks are obtained using the masking schedule (cosine schedule) combined with the confidence scores. Their experiments results demonstrate competitive performance in terms of both subjective and objective quality of the generated speech. Besides generating the single speaker utterance level of speech signal, the paper also conducted an experiment to generate the two-speaker conversational speech with an impressive speech quality and smooth speaker turn.

### Strengths
1, While not originally proposing, the paper adopted the MaskGIT method from image domain for efficient parallel audio generation. This method can generate high quality speech signal while requiring much smaller number of inference steps compared to the autoregressive style baseline system AudioLM. The proposed technology allows generating high quality long form audio signals. The proposed method shows great potential to solve such challenging problem. 

2, The experimental parts are comprehensive, various evaluations are performed to measure the quality of the generated speech as well as the run time complexity. The results clearly demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. 

3, The motivation and background introduction is comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is the writing part which lacks some details someties, or the description is not clear without reading the MaskGIT reference paper. Some examples are listed as below, please revise these parts accordingly.  

1, In the 1st paragraph of Sec. 3.3, the definition or the criteria for confidence score should be explained explicitly. As the confidence score is one of the most important key points of the proposed method, it is important to describe it clearly in this section so that the readers do not have to turn to the reference paper. 

2, In the 2nd paragraph of Sec. 3.3, when you mention “the conditional independence assumption in finer levels”, you should add that this assumption is made along the time dimension. Otherwise, it could confuse the readers that such conditional independence exists along the RVQ level dimension which conflicts with the fact that inference is performed from lower level to higher level. 

3, In sec. 4, the experiments part lack of the training configuration details, such as batch size, learning rate scheduler, optimization method, etc. This happens for both utterance-based generation and conversational speech generation. This leads the proposed work not reproducible.

### Questions
1, In Sec. 3, for the ablation study of number of decoding steps, did you also perform such experiment to measure the effect of the number of decoding steps on the WER/CER performance? 

2, In Sec. 3.3, iterative parallel decoding, have you tried to replace the unmasked tokens from previous inference stage with the estimation from current inference stage with a higher confidence score? The question here applies to both current RVQ layer and previous RVQ layers.

3, The original MaskGIT paper describes the limitation and failure cases of the MaskGIT method, such as semantic and color shifts, ignore and modify objects on the boundary when applied to outpainting and inpainting, oversmoothing or creates undesired artifacts on complex structure, etc. Are these limitations also appliable to speech generation task? Could you comment the technique limitations of the SoundStorm method?
