# United We Train, Divided We Fail! Representation Learning for Time Series by Pretraining from 75 Datasets at Once

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
In natural language processing and vision, pretraining is utilized to learn effective representations. Unfortunately, the success of pretraining does not easily carry over to time series due to potential mismatch between sources and target. Actually, common belief is that multi-dataset pretraining does not work for time series! Au contraire, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive pretraining approach to learn one encoding from many unlabeled and diverse time series datasets, so that the single learned representation can then be reused in several target domains for, say, classification. Specifically, we propose the XD-MixUp interpolation method and the Soft Interpolation Contextual Contrasting (SICC) loss. Empirically, this outperforms both supervised training and other self-supervised pretraining methods when finetuning on low-data regimes. This disproves the common belief: We can actually learn from multiple time series datasets, even from 75 at once.

### Summary
Authors propose a self-supervised pre-training method for time-series data encompassing various domains and temporal dynamics and show that it leads to significant performance gains for finetuning on small datasets. The problem is well-motivated as time-series occurs in domains such as traffic, weather, finance, etc and in many cases labelled data is limited.

Given a time-series $x \in R^T$ authors propose to encode it as a sequence $z \in R^{K \times d}$ via a simple convnet. For this, authors collect various labelled and unlabelled time-series datasets (>75) and pretrain on all of them. Pretraining consists of various objectives from prior works and some novel components. At a high level, the encoder is trained to predict $z_K$ from the context $z[<K]$. During finetuning $z_K$ is used to classify $x$. For better generalization, during pretrianing, a different time-series $y$ is chosen from the batch and a convex combination $\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y$ is used for learning a continuous latent space between samples from various datasets. Training losses are designed to learn representations that are robust to augmentations such as magnitude scaling, permutation and jitter.

Authors demonstrate the utility of the method on a large collection of timeseries datasets over various modalities.

### Strengths
1. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive and the empirical gains over supervised training are significant, clearly demonstrating the utility of the proposed method for prertaining on diverse datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelity of the method is limited and the main components such as augmentations and TC loss are borrowed from previous works such as TS-TCC.

2. The significance of the novel contribution, SICC loss, isnt made fully clear. In Table 1 the experiments are performed on a limited number of datasets and data, and it seems that including the SICC loss helps. In contrast, Table 2 and Figure 6 suggets that finetuning on all available data, excluding the SICC loss (essentially resulting in the TS-TCC model from prior work) doesnt hurt the performance significantly.

3. The TS-TCC framework is itself not intuitive to begin with - what exactly is the need for such data augmentations and contrived losses derived from these? Why to only use the last vector $z_K$ to be predicted from context $c$ - why not predict $z_t$ from $z_{t-1}$ for every $t$? How is $c$ formed? Not clear if this pipeline cannot be replaced with a much simpler training pipeline assuming more data is available.

### Summary
The paper summarizes a way to pre-train a model on multiple datasets to learn representations which are useful for downstream tasks such as classification. The authors propose modifications to an earlier method called TS-TCC, which introduces weak and hard augmentations to time-series. The authors propose a novel loss function SICC which ensures that augmented time-series contexts are similar to the time-series contexts from which they are interpolated.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. 
2. To the best of my knowledge, pre-training on multiple time-series datasets has not been explored. 
3. I like the vision behind the experimental section, as well as its organization into research questions.

### Weaknesses
1. **Contributions:** It is unclear how significant the contributions of the study are beyond training on multiple datasets. It seems to be an incremental improvement over TS-TCC and the experimental setup of TF-C. Could the authors experimentally demonstrate why it is infeasible to use TS-TCC (and TF-C) for pre-training on multiple datasets?
2. **Experimentation:** I like how the authors have structure their experimentation in terms of research questions. However, I feel that the results are not convincing due to several reasons: (1) Multiple baselines including recent works such as TS2Vec [1], older techniques such as T-Loss [2] and TST [3], and statistical methods such as Dynamic Time Warping-based Nearest Neighbors (see [1]) were missing. (2) The experiment framework differs from some prior work, where the representations are used to train a downstream classifier such as SVM for classification (see [1] and [2] for example). I wonder whether, how and why is the fine-tuning and subsequent evaluation different from that of prior work, including the metrics used to compare the methods (i.e. accuracy). Also see section on Clarity below. (3) The ablation results in Table 2 seem insignificant since the variances of the models are overlapping. I would be interested in seeing a critical difference diagram to see if the differences between the proposed method and ablations are indeed significant. 
3. **Clarity:** Some important details in experimentation were missing, for example, how were the models fine-tuned? I see from the appendix that cross-entropy loss was used, but it is unclear what was the structure of the model.

### Summary
The paper challenges the common belief that pretraining is ineffective for time series data due to source-target mismatch. The authors introduce a novel approach called XIT, combining XD-MixUp, SICC, and Temporal Contrasting, to create a shared latent representation from up to 75 diverse unlabeled time series datasets, which outperforms supervised training and other self-supervised methods, especially in low-data scenarios. The work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-dataset pretraining for time series, debunking the prevailing myth and paving the way for further advancements in leveraging multiple datasets for improved time series classification and analysis.

### Strengths
The paper excels in its clear and effective communication of key concepts, ensuring a coherent and easily-followed narrative. It tackles a significant and intriguing challenge within time series analysis: the development of a pre-trained model by leveraging multiple diverse datasets. Furthermore, the paper rigorously examines the individual components of the proposed method through ablations, providing valuable insights into how each element influences downstream performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of the proposed method is constrained, as it heavily relies on TS-TCC (Eldele et al., 2021). The SICC loss, derived from previous works (Sohn, 2016) and (Chen et al., 2020), bears resemblance to the one used in TS-TCC and essentially facilitates soft alignments. While the authors claim XD-MixUp as a novel contribution, it closely resembles the mixup data augmentation scheme introduced by (Zhang et al., 2018) and previously applied in the time series domain by (Wickstrøm et al., 2022).
2. The method's evaluation is limited in scope, as it only compares against two pre-trained methods, one of which is closely related to the proposed approach. Notably, the paper overlooks significant baseline models such as TS2Vec (Yue et al., 2022), CoST (Woo et al., 2022a), and One Fits All (OFA) (Zhou et al., 2023).

### Questions
Is there any particular reason why some recent methods, like the ones described above, were not presented as baselines in the paper?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new pretraining procedure for time-series datasets. It leverages two ideas in prior work, namely point wise MixUp and Temporal Contrastive loss. On top of these ideas the authors propose to adapt the sample contrastive loss from TS-TCC to take into account the sampled MixUp ratio. Experiments on common time series datasets show that the method outperforms the very related TS-TCC baseline. Moreover, additional experiments with multiple datasets show that there is an improvement the more datasets that are used and ablation studies on each component of the proposed method show that they contribute towards a better performance.

### Strengths
The idea is well presented and makes use of two methods that have shown to provide significant improvements in time-series modeling.

The paper has a thorough experimental setup with multiple datasets that are popular in this field. In addition, the authors perform multiple runs and report the standard deviation for all experiments.

### Weaknesses
Given that this paper proposes a relatively small change in prior work the experimental results need to be strong and clearly show that this change provides an improvement over the baseline. However, for the first experiment which is the same setting as TS-TCC, the paper firstly reports a different metric and secondly significantly lower performance than the one reported in the TS-TCC paper. Moreover, table 1 reports AUROC significantly <0.5 for Epilepsy which is a binary classification problem.

One of the main premises of the paper is that this method allows pretraining on multiple datasets. It is that the experiment on the UCR datasets does provide some improvement when using more datasets for pretraining. However, the standard deviations are so high that it makes the result very minor. Moreover, there is no evidence provided that this would not apply to TS-TCC. On the contrary, in table 1 TS-TCC seems to improve with more datasets more often than XIT.

Finally the standard deviation in the ablation study is so large that it makes it hard to draw conclusions regarding the benefit of the components of the method. For instance one could argue that MixUp and TC are as good as XIT.

### Questions
What is the performance of XIT for table 1 using the same setting as TS-TCC for their table 2 and fig 3?

How can the area under the ROC curve for binary classification be ~0.2 on table 1 last column for TF-C?
