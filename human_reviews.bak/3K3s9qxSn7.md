## Abstract
We study the representation complexity of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of circuit complexity. We prove theoretically that there exists a broad class of MDPs such that their underlying transition and reward functions can be represented by constant depth circuits with polynomial size, while the optimal $Q$-function suffers an exponential circuit complexity in constant-depth circuits. By drawing attention to the approximation errors and building connections to complexity theory, our theory provides unique insights into why model-based algorithms usually enjoy better sample complexity than model-free algorithms from a novel representation complexity perspective: in some cases, the ground-truth rule (model) of the environment is simple to represent, while other quantities, such as $Q$-function, appear complex. We empirically corroborate our theory by comparing the approximation error of the transition kernel, reward function, and optimal $Q$-function in various Mujoco environments, which demonstrates that the approximation errors of the transition kernel and reward function are consistently lower than those of the optimal $Q$-function. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the circuit complexity of RL, which also provides a rigorous framework for future research.

### Summary
This paper studies the representation complexity of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the context of circuit complexity. The authors introduce a special class of majority MDPs and theoretically demonstrate that while the transition and reward functions of these MDPs have low representation complexity, the optimal Q-function exhibits exponential representation complexity. The paper then extends these findings empirically by examining MuJoCo Gym environments and measuring the relative approximation errors of neural networks in fitting these functions. The results demonstrate that the optimal Q-functions are significantly harder to approximate than the transition and reward functions which supports their theoretical findings.

### Strengths
- Novelty: this is the first work to study the representation complexity of RL under a circuit complexity framework. The authors introduced a general class Majority MDPs, such that their transition kernels and reward functions have much lower circuit complexity than their optimal Q-functions. And the authors provides unique insights into why model-based algorithms usually enjoy better sample complexity than model-free algorithms from a novel representation complexity perspective.
- The theoretical results are supported by empirical demonstrations.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical nature of the Majority MDP might limit its direct applicability to practical problems. 
- A minor point that the experiment section only includes a limited set of small scale gym environments.

### Questions
How might these insights inspire the design and development of improvements to RL algorithms?

### Summary
This work studies the representation complexity of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Different from the prior work (Dong et al., 2020b), this paper considers a less restrictive family of MDP and incorporates circuit complexity for more fundamental and rigorous theoretical results. This work introduces the definitions of Parity MDP and Majority MDP and proves that the reward function and the transition function have lower circuit complexity than value functions. Experiments are conducted in MuJoCo continuous control tasks with SAC algorithm, quantitively corroborating the theoretical results.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and organized. The presentation is smooth and clear.
- To my knowledge, the representation complexity study for the MDP family considered in this paper is novel and significant.
- Both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation are provided.

### Weaknesses
- Although the authors mentioned that the considered MDP family is general, it is not clear how the circuit representation complexity in visual-input MDPs (or POMDP) and stochastic-transition MDPs can be. I think at least some discussions and remarks on these points will be useful.
- The experiments are not convincing to me. Some important details are missing, e.g., the exact computation of the approximation error of the optimal Q-function. Moreover, I think the variation in terms of the network scale (i.e., $d$ and $\omega$) and environments (e.g., Atari) is insufficient.

&nbsp;

I would be willing to raise my rating if my concerns are addressed. Please see the concrete questions below.

### Questions
1) What are the approximation errors of the optimal $Q$-function calculated exactly in the experiments? Fitting the $Q$ values given by the learned SAC critics or fitting the monte carlo returns of the learned policy (i.e., the actor)?

2) How will the experimental results change when varying the size of neural network used? I think only one configuration (i.e., $d=2, \omega = 32$) is insufficient.

3) How can the circuit representation complexity be in visual-input MDPs (or POMDP) and stochastic-transition MDPs?

### Summary
This paper studies the representation complexity of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. It proposes to use circuit complexity and proves that for a large class of MDPs, the representation complexity of models is larger than that of Q-values. Furthermore, the paper conducts several experiments showing that the approximation error of the Q-value function class are typically larger than that of the model class, indicating learning Q-value functions is harder than learning models, which coincides with the intuition.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides a new perspective of representation complexity in learning MDPs, and the introduction of circuit complexity into this domain seems novel.
2. Both theoretical and experimental results are solid and sound.

### Weaknesses
1. While the majority MDPs is broad, it fails to see if common MDPs are in this class or close to this class such that in many real life applications the circuit complexity of the Q-value function class is higher than that of the model class.

### Questions
1. While the circuit complexity is a good starting point to study the representation complexity, is it possible that there are other quantities or metrics such that the representation complexity might behave differently?
