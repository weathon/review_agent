- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
The general sequential decision-making problem, which includes Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) as special cases, aims at maximizing a cumulative reward by making a sequence of decisions based on a history of observations and actions over time. Recent studies have shown that the sequential decision-making problem is statistically learnable if it admits a low-rank structure modeled by predictive state representations (PSRs). Despite these advancements, existing approaches typically involve oracles or steps that are computationally intractable. On the other hand, the upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches, which have served successfully as computationally efficient methods in bandits and MDPs, have not been investigated for more general PSRs, due to the difficulty of optimistic bonus design in these more challenging settings. This paper proposes the first known UCB-type approach for PSRs, featuring a novel bonus term that upper bounds the total variation distance between the estimated and true models. We further characterize the sample complexity bounds for our designed UCB-type algorithms for both online and offline PSRs. In contrast to existing approaches for PSRs, our UCB-type algorithms enjoy computational tractability, last-iterate guaranteed near-optimal policy, and guaranteed model accuracy.

### Summary
This work establishes the first UCB-type algorithms for PSR problems. The proposed algorithm is computationally tractable compared with previous methods and obtains sample complexity which matches the previous best upper bound w.r.t. the rank of PSR and accuracy level. The counterpart of the algorithm and analysis in the offline case has also been established.

### Strengths
1. Motivation: Given previous methods studying PSR problems that are not computationally tractable or sample from posteriors maintained over a large model set, studying a computationally tractable method for PSR is well-motivated.
2. Novelty: This work proposes the first UCB bonus to enable efficient exploration of PSR problems, the core design of which is a new MLE guarantee. The newly proposed MLE guarantee and UCB bonus might be of independent interest.

### Weaknesses
1. The proof of Theorem 1 relies on some sort of MLE guarantee, a confidence bound constructed by the empirical features and relating the empirical bonus to the ground-truth bonus. Such an approach shares similar spirits as previous works studying MDP with low-rank structures (say [1]). I would like to suggest the authors give more comparisons on this.
2. The result in Theorem 1 seems to critically depend on the newly proposed MLE guarantee in this work. It might be better if discussions about how this MLE guarantee is established and to what extent it differs from previous ones are given.
3. By “computationally efficient”, it in most cases means that the algorithm enjoys polynomial computation efficiency. In some parts of this work, the authors claim that the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient. In my opinion, the proposed algorithm is indeed computationally tractable or oracle-efficient but might not be “computation efficient”, since the polynomial efficiency of the proposed algorithm is not guaranteed (correct me if I am wrong).

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper adds the UCB (or LCB) term to online or offline POMDP. The modification compared with (Liu et al., 2022) is that 1) a hard threshold $p_\min$ adding to the selection of $\Theta$ and 2) the UCB term used in exploration.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow
- The online algorithm can provide a `last-iteration' bound, and the bonus term can be efficiently calculated.

### Weaknesses
- Compare with (Liu et al., 2023), why during the exploration, the action trajectory needs to be sampled from $(\mathcal A \times \mathcal Q_h^{\mathcal A}) \cup Q_{h-1}^{\mathcal A}$, why we need the last term $Q_{h-1}^{\mathcal A}$? In addition, why we do not need to guarantee $\mathcal B_{k+1} \subseteq \mathcal B_{k}$ here?
- The sample complexity of the online algorithm is confusing, it looks more like a 'reward-free' paradigm, in which we are concerned about the *sample complexity* instead of the *regret*. When we talk about the 'last iteration regret', we should assume this regret bound works for all $k$ and the algorithm will not change regarding different $k$, which is not the case in this paper: we need to predefine a $K$ and get the sample complexity bound. Thus I think this result is kind of strange.
- I wonder what will the algorithm look like if we do not only use $V_{theta, b}$ but use the optimistic value function $V_{theta, R} + V_{theta, b}$ in the online algorithm, should the result be the same with (Liu et al., 2023)?
- Why the constrain related to $p_\min$ is easy to hold? Is there any theoretical justification? In other words, what will happen if that constrain does not hold for any $\theta$?

### Summary
This paper studies learning predictive state representations (PSRs) using UCB-type approaches. The proposed PSR-UCB algorithm is based on an upper bound for the total variance distance between estimated and true models. The algorithm requires supervised learning oracles based on which it is computationally efficient and has a last iterate guarantee. An offline variant PSR-LCB is also proposed.

### Strengths
- This paper is in general well-written and smooth to follow, with the exception of some proofs in the supplementary material. 
- The originality of the paper is high as it proposes a novel UCB-based algorithm for PSRs. Related works are covered in detail.
- The theoretical proofs seem to be rigorous.
- The proposed UCB-based algorithm enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and might be of interest to researchers.

### Weaknesses
My main concerns with this paper are as follows.
- First, the theoretical results crucially depend on the MLE oracle, which is called $H$ times during the implementation. However, the paper falls short in discussing the difficulty of solving the MLE estimation. At least, it would be better if, for some special class of $\theta$'s, the authors could show how the estimation could be implemented and what's computationally costly. 
- This paper is purely theoretical and lacks experiments even on synthetic data. I would appreciate simulation results validating the sample complexity presented in the theory.

### Questions
I've detailed my primary concerns and suggestions above. However, I have a couple of specific questions regarding certain aspects:

1. On Page 6, just below equation (2), could the authors elaborate on why learning \$\bar{\psi}^*(\tau_h^{k, h+1}) $ might be harmful when $\mathbb{P}_{\theta^*}^{\pi^{k-1}}(\tau_h^{k, h+1}) $ is very small?

2. In Algorithm 1, the UCB-approach seems to serve as a pure exploration mechanism aimed at enhancing the estimation of $\theta $. Yet, in Algorithm 2, the upper confidence bound for $ D_{TV} $ is directly employed to construct a lower confidence bound for $V_{\theta^*, R}^\pi $, which the output policy then optimizes. Could you shed light on what drives this distinction between the designs of the two algorithms? Or, is there an underlying equivalence between them?

### Summary
This paper presents an UCB-based algorithm to learn parameters in POMDP using predictive state representations (PSRs) to simplify the number of potential historical and future trajectories. PSRs assume a smaller subset of possible trajectories with a low-rank basis. Therefore, PSRs can efficiently reduce the dimensionality required to represent all the historical or future trajectories.

Using PSRs, the authors show how to use maximum likelihood method to find the most likely PSR parameters, and then use an additional bonus function to quantify the uncertainty of the learned PSR parameters. The algorithm leads to no-regret guarantees with a sample complexity bound induced from the regret analysis. The UCB construction is quite different from other UCB algorithms that I have seen in the literature of multi-armed bandits.

### Strengths
**Solid theoretical analysis**: I checked the main paper but didn’t check the appendix. The main paper and proof sketches are theoretically sound to me.

**UCB algorithm for learning parameters in POMDP (reduction in learning space)**: careful and detailed analysis of a complex problem of learning parameters of POMDP from historical trajectories. Previous online learning in sequential problems usually learns the tabular-from parameters directly with easily constructed UCBs. This paper analyzes UCBs in predictive state representations (PSRs), which can reduce the number of potential historical trajectories in POMDP to maintain UCBs.

**New analysis**: the analysis is indeed new to me. I appreciate the novelty in theoretical contributions.

### Weaknesses
**Computation**: the computation cost is still expensive with a dependency on how good the PSR is (the size of $Q_h$). Could you elaborate more on the overall computation complexity and point out what is the bottleneck?

**Reward-free claim**: the theoretical results and the analysis are reward-free by design. The major learning problem is on learning the transition probability using PSR. The reward function is bounded within [0,1] so I am not surprised that the algorithm and results are reward-free.

**Overly complicated notations**: I understand this is a difficult problem with many notations needed for the analysis. But the presentation is very difficult to follow and its clarity can be significantly improved. I believe there is a better way to present and help readers understand the analysis better.

**Sample complexity**: I thought a major advantage of PSRs is to discard the dependency on the number of all possible history with size $O(|A|^H |O|^H)$. However, this term still appears in your sample complexity with a dependency on $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. The dependency on the action and observation space is hidden in $\epsilon = p_{min}$ where $p_{min} = O(\delta / {|O|^H |A|^H})$. Could you explain how your algorithm improves and compares with the online learning algorithms without using PSRs?

**Offline learning**: the offline learning part directly follows the same proof as the online learning part. Could you elaborate if there is any new insights brought by the offline learning analysis?

### Questions
**Questions**: please answer my questions mentioned in the weaknesses section. I am happy to raise the score if some of my questions are clarified.


**Typos or confusions**:
- Equation 1: what does $\pi(\omega_h)$ mean? Your definition of $\pi$ measures the probability of choosing a sequence of actions conditioned on a sequence of observations. $\pi(\omega_h)$ only specifies the future trajectory after time $h$ but does not specify the history prior to $h$. Please clarify.
- After finishing reading the paper, I still don’t see what does the “physical meaning” mean in Section 4.1.
- Line 4 in Algorithm 1: notations of $\omega_{h-1}^{k,h}$ and $\tau_{h-1}^{k,h}$ are confusing. You have a different use of superscript on $\omega$ and $\tau$ defined previously. The following discussion in Page 6 is helpful though.
- Equation 3: $\tau_h \in D_h^k$, abused notation which collides with the definition of the bonus function with a different $\tau_h$ involved. Similarly, there is a typo in the following sentence: $\{ \hat{\phi}^k(\tau_h) \}_{\tau \in D^k_h}$ where $tau_h$ should be $\tau$ unless I misunderstood.
