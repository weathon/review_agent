# Vocabulary for Universal Approximation: A Linguistic Perspective of Mapping Compositions

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 3

## Abstract
In recent years, deep learning-based sequence modelings, such as language models, have received much attention and success, which pushes researchers to explore the possibility of transforming non-sequential problems into a sequential form. Following this thought, deep neural networks can be represented as composite functions of a sequence of mappings, linear or nonlinear, where each composition can be viewed as a \emph{word}. However, the weights of linear mappings are undetermined and hence require an infinite number of words. In this article, we investigate the finite case and constructively prove the existence of a finite \emph{vocabulary} $V$={$\phi_i: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d | i=1,...,n$} with $n=O(d^2)$ for the universal approximation. That is, for any continuous mapping $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$, compact domain $\Omega$ and $\varepsilon>0$, there is a sequence of mappings $\phi_{i_1}, ..., \phi_{i_m} \in V, m \in Z_+$, such that the composition $\phi_{i_m} \circ ... \circ \phi_{i_1} $ approximates $f$ on $\Omega$ with an error less than $\varepsilon$. Our results provide a linguistic perspective of composite mappings and suggest a cross-disciplinary study between linguistics and approximation theory.

### Confidence
1: You are unable to assess this paper and have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from different reviewers.

### Summary
This paper examined the approximation property of mapping composition from a sequential perspective. 
The author claim to prove the universal approximation for diffeomorphisms can be achieved by using a finite number of sequential mappings for the first time. And the results show that the universal approximations can be easily achieved.

### Strengths
The paper focus on an important problem: the application of sequential model to various morphism has only to empirically studied but never been theoretically proved.   So if the Theorems in this paper is right, it could be a missing piece to the puzzle. 
Honestly I am not theoretically sound enough to understand this paper, so I can't give more valuable suggestion to this paper.

### Weaknesses
It would be the paper more convincible if the author could add some empirical experiments and analysis to show more evidence to the theory.

### Questions
Honestly I am not theoretically sound enough to understand this paper, so I can't give more valuable questions to this paper.

## Human Reviewer 2

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presents a constructive proof of a universal approximation result, namely that any mapping can be represented as the composition of functions selected from a finite set of functions, drawing analogies to how any sentence can be build from a finite set of words.The main idea of the constructive proof is to demonstrate that a sequence of flow maps derived from ODEs can be combined to approximate any given continuous mapping.

### Strengths
* Important and intuitive theoretical result
* Solid motivation through the universality of language
* Good contextualization with results from related works
* Certainly relevant to some parts of the ICLR community

I can't reasonably comment on the correctness of the proof, since I am not familiar with most of the literature or techniques used.

### Weaknesses
* The paper could use a "Preliminaries" section to introduce the non-expert reader to some of the relevant concepts, such as ODEs and orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Instead, the paper refers to a textbook introduction to dynamical systems, which is not practical. Only slightly more than 8 / 9 pages were used, so there is almost 1 page of space left for these kinds of things.

Minor:
* use \citep and \citet where appropriate

### Questions
CMOW is a simple sentence embedding method that represents every word as a matrix and composes words in a sentence via matrix multiplication. Hence, CMOW builds a linear deep neural network dynamically. Could you comment on in how far this relates to your idea in the conclusion to construct novel NLP models by embedding every word as a function?

### Summary
*I was asked to provide an emergency review for this paper after having reviewed a very similar version of this paper submitted to NeurIPS. Overall, I find that there have been minimal changes in this version and that the concerns I previously raised about the claimed link between these results and linguistic compositionality have not been addressed.*

This paper provides universal approximation results with a compositional structure. That is, they give a universal approximation result for natural classes of continuous functions where the approximator is a finite composition of functions in a finite set of atomic continuous functions (flow maps). Most of the paper is devoted to giving at the proof, which is repeatedly building up to the greatest level of detail. Specifically, the two key aspects of the proof are:
1. Decompose target function \Psi into alternating elements of two sets H1 and H2. This maps roughly onto 3.2 and directly onto 4.1/4.2 2. 2. Approximate any element of H1 or H2 with composition of flow maps in the finite vocabulary V. This maps onto 3.3

### Strengths
1. I am not an expert in approximation theory, but the results seem correct to the best of my knowledge. I have noted below some sources of confusion.
2. I appreciate the creative motivation for the paper and interdisciplinary aspiration: bringing together dynamical systems, approximation theory, and linguistics to better understand if and how neural networks achieve compositionality seems like a grand challenge worth pursuing.

### Weaknesses
The authors claim several times that their work is interesting because of a connection to the idea of compositionality in linguistics:

> Our results provide a linguistic perspective of composite mappings and suggest a cross-disciplinary study between linguistics and approximation theory

> We built an analogy between composite flow maps and words/phrases/sentences in natural languages (Table 1), which could inspire cross-disciplinary studies between approximation theory, dynamical systems, sequence modeling, and linguistics.

> Our result was inspired by the fact of finite vocabulary in natural languages, where V can be mimicked to a “vocabulary”, H1 and H2 to “phrases”, and HV to “sentences”. Our results provide a linguistic aspect for composite mappings, and we hope our findings will in turn inspire related research in linguistics.

Simply put, the results in this paper do not provide a "linguistic perspective" and are not "cross-disciplinary", and I am skeptical that they engage with linguistic ideas deeply enough to inspire research in linguistics, as suggested. Since the previous version, the authors have briefly elaborated on how their results could connect to linguistics:

>  For example, the analogies can offer novel ideas for understanding or constructing NLP models. One can embed words as functions instead of vectors in traditional models, and then the text generation problems can be converted to function approximation problems. However, constructing such models involves a number of techniques that are beyond the scope of this paper

However, I don't find this to be very concrete or convincing. I will repeat some of the points mentioned in my last review about how the ideas in this paper about how a compositional approximation result could be brought to have more linguistic significance. I believe the authors either need to address these points (especially the limitation of compactness for thinking about linguistic inputs) or they should remove any claim of linguistic applicability of their results.

## Compositionality and Relevance to Linguistics

If the authors want to claim a connection to linguistics, they should concretely discuss relevant ideas about compositionality from linguistics and formal language theory in order to ground their results. Compositionality in linguistics is the idea that a finite vocabulary of basic elements can be combined via a grammar to express an infinite range of meanings. There is a rich literature on compositionality in humans and neural networks, both from theoretical and empirical perspectives. One foundational viewpoint comes out of formal language theory, where it is studied how finite grammars can generate infinite formal languages.

Another more semantic view on compositionality is the [work of Montague]([http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mkracht/html/montague.pdf](http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/mkracht/html/montague.pdf)), who argues that compositionality can be understood as an algebraic relation between the input space of strings and the output space of meanings. Meanings can be viewed as operators X → X on the world state X (i.e., discrete-time dynamical system), and we could identify each vi in the vocabulary with some meaning fi. Then one Montagovian notion of compositionality would be that concatenating vi’s is isomorphic to compositition in the meaning space. In other words, the meaning of v1 v2 v3 would be the composition of the functions f1, f2, f3. See [this paper]([https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.525.pdf](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.525.pdf)) for a recent invocation of these ideas in the study of neural networks.

It seems like your results could be better interpreted if tied to this Montagovian framing. You could assume a bijection between your set of functions F and a finite vocabulary V. Then all possible strings over V defines an input space of strings, and each string v = v1 v2 v3 maps to a function f that is the composition of f1, f2, f3. From this point of view, the interpretation of your result would be that any function over a compact domain can be expressed compositionally in terms of V. This is a bit different from the standard notion of compositionality in linguistics: that the meaning of the whole input is a composition of the meanings of different parts of the input. For you, the primitive “parts” are just some finite set independent from the input. Another way of saying this is that your universal approximation construction is compositional in V, not in the input, which makes it unclear what exactly is relevant for linguistic compositionality.

However, this perspective does make me see a connection between your work and logic. One way to understand a logic is simply as a finite compositional system for expressing functions (predicates over models). From this point of view, one way to interpret your result is that general functions can be expressed in a certain logic that captures the operations in V as well as composition. Perhaps this framing might be a better description of the takeaways from your paper.

## Discrete vs. Continuous and Compactness

Additionally, my main issue was that there is a disconnect between compositional approximation of functions over compact continuous domains and functions over discrete sequences (which is what people care about in linguistics). The authors have not addressed these concerns or even mentioned this limitation. I have summarized my comments on this from the last review below.

An issue for drawing connection between these results and linguistics is is the disconnect between continuous and discrete domains. Your main theorems apply for functions over continuous domains and rely on compactness. In contrast, the type of functions most relevant in linguistics are over discrete domains: either string recognition problems (V* → {0, 1}) or string transductions (V* → V*), and is not a natural notion here.

A natural idea is to embed these discrete domains into continuous domains and apply continuous universal approximation, but this does not quite work. For an unbounded input sequence in V*, either the continuous representation will be non-compact or the precision will have to grow in the sequence length. We conclude that compactness is not achievable with bounded precision, meaning that universal approximation constructions relying on compactness will fall apart for long sequences (similar points have been made in the formal languages literature on neural networks, e.g.: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16213)). I still find your results interesting and relevant, but given that your explicit goal is to make a connection between approximation theory and linguistics (where discrete sequences are relevant), I believe it is necessary to mention this caveat. Otherwise, some readers will not recognize that the “compact domain” condition really means your results apply with bounded length.

## Comments on Presentation

I also had several comments and suggestions on clarity from the last version that have not been clarified in this version of the paper.

You should say something briefly about what flow maps are in either 2.2 or 3 besides simply citing Arrowsmith & Place. For example, a flow map is the mapping from the initial value x0 to the state of the system after time tau, where x0 is allowed to vary. In the previous round of review, you noted you had added some clarification of this, but I couldn't find it in this version and would suggest changing 2.2 or 3 specifically.

Additionally, in some parts the notation is verbose to the point where I either recognize it could be simplified for readability or do not understand it:
- In line 88, V, V_F are the same, and F and V are distinguished only so that you can introduce a running index i over the elements of F? Just define the set one and say you will use an enumeration of the elements in the set. Also, would be more conventional to use \Sigma instead of V for the finite vocabulary from which words will be formed.
- Equation 10: Notation and indexing is unclear at first glance. Why not something like h_1 * g_1 * h_2 * g_2 … ?
- Equation 13: what is the upside down plus/minus? I like that the authors have run through the structure of the proof several times at different levels of abstraction (Section 2, 3, and 4). However, I think this could be made more explicit for the reader, with back references to the previous presentation. There could also be more through text so that the flow between sections and paragraphs is easier to understand. Additionally, it is a bit confusing that the Part 1/Part 2 structure is reflected in Section 3, but not in Part 4.

### Questions
In the previous round of review and paper discussion, you mentioned:

> To be honest, our manuscript is also motivated by another question: are there any other word embedding methods other than word vectors? Our theorem gives an answer and suggests embedding words as functions or dynamical systems.

Could you clarify what you meant by this?

### Summary
The paper uses an analogy between word sequences and compositions of continuous maps from analysis to obtain a compositional way of learning word embeddings in NN's.

### Strengths
It is nice that the mathematical theory underlying neural networks are used to instantiate a result on the application side.

### Weaknesses
The main problem is that the analogy upon which the paper is based fails. In linguistics, composition works along side syntactic structure. This means that each sequence of words that constitutes a sentence has a syntactic structure and that this structure defines what are the phrases within the sentence and how they are composed with each other. The paper assumes that this composition works along side words and is word by word. The phrase and sentence syntactic structures are completely ignored.  In other words, simple sequential compositions of maps does not correspond to linguistic composition. 

I think the authors can remedy this by looking at the elementary fragment of a language of their choice, often taken to be English, and provide compositions alongside the phrase structures there. This latter is easily represented in a generative grammer and via Chomsky's original definitions. For instance a sentence S is generated by an NP followed by a VP: S-> NP VP.  An NP is generated by a determiner followed by a singular noun, or a plural noun on its own, NP -> Det Noun | PlNoun| ... etc etc. 

I would like to strongly encourage the authors to do this.
