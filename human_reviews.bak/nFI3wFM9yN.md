## Abstract
Federated optimization studies the problem of collaborative function optimization among multiple clients (e.g. mobile devices or organizations) under the coordination of a central server. Since the data is collected separately by each client and always remains decentralized, federated optimization preserves data privacy and allows for large-scale computing, which makes it a promising decentralized machine learning paradigm. Though it is often deployed for tasks that are online in nature, e.g., next-word prediction on keyboard apps, most works formulate it as an offline problem. The few exceptions that consider federated bandit optimization are limited to very simplistic function classes, e.g., linear, generalized linear, or non-parametric function class with bounded RKHS norm, which severely hinders its practical usage. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named Fed-GO-UCB, for federated bandit optimization with generic non-linear objective function. Under some mild conditions, we rigorously prove that Fed-GO-UCB is able to achieve sub-linear rate for both cumulative regret and communication cost. At the heart of our theoretical analysis are distributed regression oracle and individual confidence set construction, which can be of independent interests. Empirical evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Summary
The paper introduces Fed-GO-UCB, a federated bandit optimization algorithm designed for generic non-linear objective functions, addressing the limitations of existing methods that are confined to simplistic function classes. Federated optimization enables collaborative model estimation across decentralized datasets, ensuring data privacy and allowing large-scale computing. This is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring online interactions, such as next-word prediction in keyboard applications. Fed-GO-UCB operates under the coordination of a central server and multiple clients, ensuring data decentralization. The algorithm comprises two phases: uniform exploration and optimistic exploration, allowing clients to collaboratively minimize cumulative regret and make quality decisions during the learning process. The paper highlights the challenges in federated bandit optimization, particularly in constructing confidence sets for generic nonlinear functions and managing communication costs. Fed-GO-UCB addresses these issues through a novel confidence set construction and an efficient communication strategy. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the algorithm's superiority over existing federated bandit algorithms, particularly in approximating nonlinear functions. The paper also proves that Fed-GO-UCB achieves sub-linear rates for both cumulative regret and communication cost, making it a promising tool for decentralized machine learning applications involving sensitive data.

### Strengths
1. Novelty: Fed-GO-UCB is a new approach in federated bandit optimization for generic non-linear function optimization.

2. Theoretical Guarantees: The paper provides rigorous proofs for the sub-linear rates of cumulative regret and communication cost, ensuring the algorithm's reliability and efficiency.

3. Empirical Validation: The effectiveness of Fed-GO-UCB is demonstrated through extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing its superiority in approximating nonlinear functions and its practical applicability.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited Discussion on Assumptions: The paper mentions “some mild conditions” under which the algorithm performs well, but it could provide a more detailed discussion on these conditions and their practical implications.

2. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the paper demonstrates the superiority of Fed-GO-UCB over existing federated bandit algorithms, a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods in decentralized machine learning would strengthen the paper's contributions.

3. Over-reliance on Communication: The need for occasional communications to aggregate local learning parameters may lead to potential inefficiencies or delays.

### Questions
1. How does the performance of Fed-GO-UCB compare with centralized global optimization methods, particularly in scenarios with a high number of clients?

2. Can Fed-GO-UCB be extended to handle heterogeneous clients with different reward functions, and if so, what modifications would be necessary?

3. What are the practical implications of the “mild conditions” under which Fed-GO-UCB operates, and how do these conditions influence the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios?

### Summary
This paper studies the federated bandit optimization where the objective functions are non-linear yet i.i.d across $N$ agents. Existing works focus on either simplistic function classes or non-parametric function classes with bounded RKHS norms. In this paper, the authors propose a new Fed-GO-UCB algorithm, which contains two phases: the uniform exploration phase and the online learning phase. The authors prove that Fed-GO-UCB ahives $O(\sqrt{NT})$ regret while achieving $O(N^{1.5}\sqrt{T})$ communication cost. Finally, the authors conduct empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to validate their theoretical results.

### Strengths
1. The problem setting is new and well-motivated. Compared with existing works that follow either simplistic function classes or non-parametric function classes with bounded RKHS norm, this work considers a more general non-linear form of objective function.
2. The results are sound and complete, with both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation.
3. The algorithms and the analysis both have some novelty, for example, the two phase algorithms and the analysis built upon it.

### Weaknesses
1. Novelty: Though the setting is new and the two-phase design is interesting, after the uniform exploration (phase 1), it seems to me that one can combine the techniques from centralized non-linear bandit optimization problem with the communication protocol from the federated linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022a) and federated generalized linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022b).
2. Comparison with federated generalized linear bandits (Li & Wang, 2022b): From the algorithmic perspective, Li & Wang 2022b also uses some global updates (similar to uniform exploration) after the communication condition (line 6 of Algorithm 1) is satisfied, I am wondering if the current paper also uses this way to update $\hat{w}_0$, will there be any difference or improvement in the regret analysis? Moreover, I find that Li & Wang, 2022b can only achieve $O(dN^2\sqrt{T})$ communication. Since I suppose the current paper is more general and can cover Li & Wang 2022b, does this mean that the current paper can achieve a $O(\sqrt{N})$ improvement because of the difference in the algorithm design?  
3. Lower bound: I do not find any discussion about the lower bound result or any discussion about it. Without it, one cannot see how tight the results are in terms of $$N, T$$ and all other parameters. I hope the authors can discuss the tightness of their results during the rebuttal.

### Summary
This paper presents a communication-efficient federated algorithm, Fed-GO-UCB, for a bandit optimization problem with non-linear function. Their analysis shows that the regret upper bound of Fed-GO-UCB matches that of Fed-GO-UCB's centralized counterpart with sub-linear communication costs. The authors explain the main logics behind analysis in details. Empirical experiment results are also included.

### Strengths
- This work is one of the pioneering effort in studying federated bandit optimization with non-linear function
- This work generalizes a distributed regression theoretical guarantee to account for approximation error, which may be of interest to the federated learning community 
- This paper is in general well written and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
- The literature review provided is somewhat brief and limited in scope and detail
- Though this work features considering non-linear function optimization, it seems that its main contribution is on addressing the challenges of federated setting. Could the authors discuss more about the special challenges of non-linear function optimization?

### Questions
- The novel technical contributions of this work are Lemma 6 and 8 if I understand correctly. Shouldn't these two lemmas be named as Propositions instead? 
- Could the authors comment on the difficulties in obtaining Lemma 6 and 8? Which part of difficulties is due to the federated setting and which part of the difficulties is due to the non-linear function?
- Could the authors comment on the tightness of the communication cost bound?

### Summary
This paper's primary focus is on tackling the non-linear bandit optimization problem within a federated setting. It introduces the innovative Fed-GO-UCB algorithm, which represents a substantial improvement over previous centralized algorithms. Remarkably, this federated algorithm achieves a theoretical regret guarantee comparable to previous centralized approaches, specifically $O(\sqrt{NT})$, while also demonstrating sub-linear communication complexity. Additionally, the empirical results robustly confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The proposed algorithm excels in providing a near-optimal guarantee for federated learning with generic non-linear function optimization.

2. The empirical results robustly confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

3. This paper is well-written and easily comprehensible.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical guarantee of Fed-GO-UCB relies on several critical assumptions (Assumptions 1 to 3), and it may be challenging to establish whether these assumptions hold in common situations, such as neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Even if the assumptions hold, determining the values of the parameters in Fed-GO-UCB that depend on these assumptions can be a non-trivial task. It remains an open question how to calculate these constants and set the algorithm's parameters effectively in practical applications.

2. The communication complexity, as indicated by Theorem 5, is stated as $O(\sqrt{T})$, which is significantly higher than the communication complexity of $O(\log T)$ achieved by previous works. Presenting this level of communication cost as efficient without providing lower bound results for communication complexity can be misleading. Furthermore, the experimental results in Figure 2 show a communication complexity of $10^7$ for round $T=500$, which seems highly inefficient in practice.

3. In the context of federated learning, there is often a tradeoff between communication complexity and performance, specifically in terms of regret guarantee. It's a common observation that algorithms with higher communication complexity can potentially achieve better performance. To gain a clearer understanding of the algorithms' relative performances, it would be beneficial for the author to conduct experiments where the selected parameters makes different algorithms have similar communication complexity. This approach would enable a direct and fair comparison that isolates the impact of communication complexity from the approximation capabilities, providing more conclusive insights into the algorithm's efficiency and effectiveness in a practical federated learning setting.

### Questions
1. In the Fed-GO-UCB algorithm, it's important to clarify that agents should reset $\Delta\Sigma$ and $\Delta b$ to zero after uploading their respective datasets.

2. In Figure 3, the observation that the communication complexity for several algorithms does not start from zero at time $T=0$ can be puzzling. It would be beneficial if the author could offer an explanation for this behavior.

3. For the Theorem 5, is it possible to provide a corresponding lower bound to suggest that $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ communication is necessary. For instance, Min el al., 2023 [1] provide a lower bound showing
that a minimal $\Omega(dM)$ communication complexity is required to improve the performance of linear bandit (or MDPs) through
collaboration. Insights into lower communication complexity bounds would strengthen the support for the Fed-GO-UCB algorithm and provide a more comprehensive understanding
