- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Semi-supervised learning is a critical tool in reducing machine learning’s dependence on labeled data. It has been successfully applied to structured data, such as images and natural language, by exploiting the inherent spatial and semantic structure therein with pretrained models or data augmentation. These methods are not applicable, however, when the data does not have the appropriate structure, or
invariances. Due to their simplicity, pseudo-labeling (PL) methods can be widely used without any domain assumptions. However, PL is sensitive to a threshold and can perform poorly if wrong assignments are made due to overconfidence. This paper studies theoretically the role of uncertainty to pseudo-labeling and proposes Confident Sinkhorn Allocation (CSA), which identifies the best pseudo-label allocation via optimal transport to only samples with high confidence scores. CSA outperforms the current state-of-the-art in this practically important area of semi-supervised learning. Additionally, we propose to use the Integral Probability Metrics to extend and improve the existing PAC-Bayes bound which relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, for ensemble models.

### Summary
To solve the problem of misallocation caused by the overconfidence of the pseudo-labeling method due to threshold sensitivity,This paper studies theoretically the role of uncertainty to pseudo-labeling and proposes Confident Sinkhorn Allocation (CSA), which identifies the best pseudolabel allocation via optimal transport to only samples with high confidence scores. CSA utilizes Sinkhorn’s algorithm to assign labels to only the data samples with high confidence scores, eliminating the need to predefine the heuristic thresholds used in existing pseudo-labeling methods. In terms of theory,this paper study the pseudo-labelling process when training on labeled set and predicting unlabeled data using a PAC-Bayes generalization bound. CSA specifies the frequency of assigned labels including the lower bound and upper bound per class as well as the fraction of data points to be assigned. Then, the optimal transport will automatically perform row and column scalings. Additionally, this paper proposes to use the Integral Probability Metrics to extend and improve the existing PAC-Bayes bound which relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.

### Strengths
This paper explains the label assignment process as an optimal transport problem between examples and classes, and solves it using the confident Sinkhorn algorithm.The proposed CSA is widely applicable to various data domains, and could be used in concert with consistency-based approaches, but is particularly useful for data domain where pretext tasks and data augmentation are not applicable, such as tabular data.

The theoretical result reveals that less uncertainty is more helpful. More number of unlabeled data is useful for a good estimation. Less number of classes and less number of input dimensions will make the estimation easier. The analysis takes a step further to show that both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty can reduce the probability of obtaining a good estimation.

In the experiment, all models use the same backbone network, and the settings of the models are described in comparison to it. Experimental verification shows that optimal transport cannot be achieved simply by changing the threshold value.The paper also conducts other empirical analysis which can be sensitive to the performance.

### Weaknesses
The legends of the figures in the paper are not very clear, making it difficult to understand the meaning of the various elements in the figures without reading the relevant paragraphs in detail.

The part about CSA in the article and the part about PAC-Bayes bound seem to have insufficient connection. Even without using knowledge about the PAC-Bayes bound, the description and derivation of the CSA part still seem to hold.

### Summary
Pseudo-labeling is suitable for learning without any domain assumptions. This work proposes a Pseudo-Labeling algorithm based on a confident score derived from ensemble models.  Firstly, a mathematical proof is presented to elucidate the impact of uncertainty in classifiers. Welch’s T-test is employed to ascertain whether the most likely class holds statistically greater significance than the second-most likely class. This serves to diminish uncertainty in the estimated classifiers. Subsequently, the label allocation process is transferred to the optimization of the optimal transport problem, and the Sinkhorn Algorithm is employed to swiftly approximate the solution. Moreover, this study establishes PAC-Bayes results using Integral Probability Metrics, which provides a guarantee of generalization performance. Additionally, comprehensive experiments are devised to facilitate a comparative evaluation with other relevant works in the field.

### Strengths
1. This work introduces an efficient algorithm aimed at mitigating uncertainty in pseudo-labeling. It leverages ensemble models to assess the confidence of labeling. Additionally, a comprehensive experimental setup is designed, encompassing not only accuracy comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms but also evaluations across various dimensions.
2. This work provides a solid mathematical proof for uncertainty analysis in Pseudo-Labeling and extends PAC-Bayes bounds to ensemble models, both of which contribute to subsequent research in this domain.

### Weaknesses
1. Errors are present in the tables and figures. In Table 1, it is noted that in the comparison of related approaches, FlexMatch should be characterized as non-greedy based on the provided content. Regarding Figure 4, the top red square on the left fails to adequately illustrate the distinctions in assignments.
2. In the section pertaining to the analysis of uncertainty in Pseudo-Labeling (PL), some aspects of the formulation concerning the settings are found to be incomplete. Consequently, this has resulted in certain points of confusion in comprehension. Although the appendix contains proofs that address some of my queries, further elucidation may be beneficial.
3. In Algorithm 1, Confident Sinkhorn Label Allocation (simplified), the derivation of b_{-} and b_{+} when setting marginal distributions is not explicitly stated. Based on the content, it is inferred that they are empirically estimated from the class label frequency in the training data or from prior knowledge. This should be explicitly mentioned in the algorithm; otherwise, it leads to unknowns and incompleteness in the algorithm.

### Questions
1. In Section 2.2, you outlined two challenges associated with assigning pseudo-labels. The proposed resolution entails employing an ensemble learning framework along with Welch's T-test to discern and exclude less confident samples. Are there alternative, more dependable methods for comparing the most probable class with the second most probable class? (Except those compared in the appendix) 
2. In the appendix, it is noted that the computational time of XGBoost increases with each iteration. Could this escalation in computational time become substantial when applied on a larger scale, potentially resulting in inefficiencies that outweigh its benefits?
3. I've noted that in the algorithm when ρ equals 1, it indicates full allocation. Additionally, I observed a limited elucidation regarding this parameter. In the appendix, ρ is configured to allocate more data points in the earlier iterations and fewer in the later ones. I am intrigued by the potential impact of varying ρ. While this obviates the necessity to predefine a suitable threshold γ, it introduces a new variable, ρ, necessitating a predefined value. Is the outcome sensitive to the choice of ρ? Is there a universally applicable ρ that ensures the algorithm's effectiveness across diverse tasks? The role of ρ in the algorithm appears somewhat ambiguous, and I am particularly keen on gaining a deeper understanding of it.

### Summary
This paper introduces Confident Sinkhorn Allocation (CSA) as an approach to improve pseudo labeling (PL) in the context of semi-supervised learning. The author delves into an analysis of the uncertainties associated with pseudo-labeling and introduces optimal transport as a means to mitigate the sensitivity observed in Greedy PL. Additionally, the paper presents a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that incorporates Integral Probability Metrics.

### Strengths
The issue of excessive confidence and sensitivity to thresholds in pseudo labeling (PL) is indeed intriguing. The author conducts an analysis of the uncertainties within PL and offers some insights into this matter.

### Weaknesses
1.	The paper's contribution appears somewhat vague. While it introduces a new pseudo labeling (PL) method, it lacks a clear probabilistic formulation. However, it's worth noting that the author does provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound in Section 2.4, particularly for ensembling multiple classifiers. It would enhance clarity to explicitly state the individual contributions of various sections within the methodology.

2.	There seems to be an inconsistency in the citation format used in the main text. The citation style in the introduction relies on numbers, but corresponding numbers in the reference list are missing. This inconsistency makes it challenging to match citations in the main text to the references.

3.	The novelty of the optimal transport assignment in Section 2.3 appears somewhat limited. The primary concept seems to be derived from the original SLA [44]. Clarifying the extent of novelty and how the proposed method builds upon or diverges from previous work would be beneficial for the reader's understanding.

### Questions
The method is primarily evaluated within the context of semi-supervised learning tasks, where sample selection is a general aspect of the approach. It raises the question of whether this technique can be extended to other settings, such as active learning or learning with noisy labels. Exploring the adaptability of this method to these different scenarios and discussing potential challenges or advantages would provide valuable insights into its broader applicability and limitations.

### Summary
The paper explores the theoretical aspects of incorporating uncertainty in pseudo-labeling and introduces a new method, Confident Sinkhorn Allocation (CSA). CSA aims to determine the best pseudo-labels using optimal transport, focusing on samples with high confidence levels. Additionally, the study suggests utilizing Integral Probability Metrics to enhance and refine the current PAC-Bayes bound, which is dependent on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, for ensemble models. Experimental results indicate CSA's superiority over existing methods in semi-supervised learning.

### Strengths
1. The authors incorporate uncertainty into the pseudo-labeling generation process and provide a theoretical interpretation. 
2. The authors study theoretically the pseudo-labelling process when training on labeled set and predicting unlabeled data using a PAC-Bayes generalization bound.

### Weaknesses
1. The choice to employ optimal transport methods for pseudo-labeling is not immediately clear, especially given the existence of the method detailed in section 2.2. It would be beneficial if the authors could elucidate on the rationale behind selecting optimal transport over the direct pseudo-labeling approach from section 2.2.
2. The paper employs an ensemble of M models, but it is ambiguous whether the observed improvement in performance is attributed to the ensemble effect or the proposed algorithm itself. The absence of an ablation study leaves this point unclarified.
3. The optimization objectives for optimal transport presented in section 2.3 lack clear explanations. It would be beneficial if the authors provide detailed interpretations for each constraint, elucidating on their roles and significance within the context of the problem.
4. In section 2.1 of the article, there appears to be some inconsistency and potential oversight regarding notation. Firstly, the representation of the unlabeled data set as $\{\tilde{X_i^k}\}$ seems non-standard. Given that $X_i^k$ denotes an individual data point, it would be more appropriate to use lowercase notation for clarity. Secondly, the expression for the probabilistic classifiers, specifically $f_k(x_i)$, is stated to produce a scalar value indicating the likelihood of $x_i$ being labeled as $k$. However, the provided formulation $f_k(x_i):=\mathcal{N}(x_i|\hat\theta_k,\Lambda)$ suggests it's a function mapping to a normal distribution parameterized by $x_i\vert\hat\theta_k$ and $\Lambda$.
5. In Theorem 1, the definition of $\mu_{\backslash k}=\mu_j\vert\exist j\in {1,...K}\backslash k$ is ambiguous. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more explicit definition or clarification regarding the intended meaning of $\mu_{\backslash k}$ in the context of the theorem.

### Questions
1. Why did the authors choose to use optimal transport methods for pseudo-labeling instead of the direct approach described in section 2.2?
2. How is the pseudo-labeling method described in section 2.2 related to the optimal transport pseudo-labeling approach in section 2.3? How do these two methods interact or complement each other in the overall framework?
3. Have the authors considered conducting an ablation study to discern the individual contributions of the ensemble effect and the proposed algorithm to the overall performance improvement?
