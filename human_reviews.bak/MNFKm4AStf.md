# Representation Disentanglement via Regularization by Causal Identification

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
In this work, we argue modern deep representation learning models for disentanglement are ill-posed with collider bias behavior; a source of bias producing dependencies between the underlying generating variables. Under the rubric of causal inference, we show this issue can be explained and reconciled under the condition of causal identification; attainable from a combination of a causal graphical model encoding the data generation process assumptions and data. For this, we propose regularization by identification (ReI), a modular regularization engine designed to align the behavior of large scale models with the disentanglement constraints imposed by causal identification. Empirical evidence on standard disentanglement benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of ReI in removing the effects of collider-bias. In a real-world dataset we show that enforcing ReI in a variational framework results in interpretable representations robust to out-of-distribution examples and that align with the true expected effect from domain knowledge.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use causal identification as a regularizer for solving the problem that modern disentanglement models are usually generating entangled factors. The regularizer is actually a measurement for dependence between factors by a combination of d-separation constraints. Several experiments support the main claim of the paper.

### Strengths
1. The proposed regularizer by a viewpoint of d-separation is novel.
2. The experiments are thorough.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical completeness and computational efficiency of the proposed method need more justifications.
2. The universality of so-called collider-bias should be stated more clearly.

### Questions
1. The proposition 1 should be mathematically more rigorous so that it is a self-contained theorem. What is " appropriate set"? The same problem applies to prop 3.
2. The definition of semi- in Fig 2. It seems that the two graphs are just to DAGs. Is there a definition that distinguish this case of "semi" with ""two different generative DAGs"?
3. It would be better if existence of collider-bias in real data can be quantitatively analyzed. How important it is if this problem is solved? Also, the evaluation of the part of "transfer" is slightly weak compared to others.

### Summary
This paper explores a causal approach of learning disentangled representations through a concept called Regularization by Identification (ReI). The motivation stems from the fact that existing approaches mistakenly find correlations between generative factors due to collider bias. The approach involves training a VAE with an extra regularization term aimed at enforcing a conditional independence constraint between the generative factors. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better disentanglement results than alternatives.

### Strengths
Exploiting collider structure in representation learning is an interesting and novel concept. The experimental results are also very extensive and quite convincing.

### Weaknesses
The paper is poorly written. Here are some of the confusing points:
1. What are “generative factors” as discussed in Prop. 1? Are they in the dataset? If so, what is the difference between $y$ and $x$?
2. What does “proposition” mean in this paper? Are they claims with proofs? They seem to simply be declaring or defining something.
3. In Prop. 2, what does it mean to say that “the identification of the causal effect $p(x \mid do(y_c))$ provides the recipe to control for dependencies between the generating factors producing entanglements through a combination of d-separation constraints and data from $p(x, y)$”? Further, does this imply that $p(x \mid do(y_c))$ is the desired query of interest? And is the discussion about d-separating $X$ from $Y$, or is it about d-separating some variables of $Y$ from other variables of $Y$?
4. How exactly is ReI defined (as in Prop. 3)? Is it the second term of Eq. 2? This could be clarified better.
5. What is the motivation of having the objective of $p(z \mid x, do(y)) = p(x \mid z)p(z \mid do(x))$? How was this derived? If Bayes rule is used here, doesn’t that drop $p(x \mid do(y))$? Also, these terms seem very different from what was introduced earlier.
6. Is Prop. 4 an assumption? This has to be clarified.
7. What exactly is the issue of collider bias with other approaches, and how does this approach avoid it?

Some factual issues are highlighted below. There may be more that I did not catch due to the clarity issues from above.
1. The factorization in Eq. 1 is not enough to argue that a DAG is causal. For example, the graph $X \rightarrow Y$ factorizes as $P(X, Y) = P(Y \mid X)P(X)$. However, the same equality holds even if the graph is $X \leftarrow Y$, despite having a different causal interpretation. It must be clarified that the arrows of the DAG represent causal relationships.
2. Def. 3 is not quite accurate. Some causal queries can be identified even without a  d-separating set.

For these reasons, I cannot recommend acceptance of this paper.

### Summary
the paper proposes a causal-inspired regularization term for representation learning. The innovation lies in the interventional distribution of the cause-effect and their identification condition, along with the proposed collider-based DAG model. An reformulation of VAE is presented with such DAG model, and empirical results show big improvements.

### Strengths
1. the idea of colider-based DAG model is new and authors show the motivation and connection with causal inference.
2. the empirical performance seems strong.

### Weaknesses
1. the major problem of the paper lies in the presentation. Many typo, inaccurate statements/notations, and grammatical errors exist. It hinders the understanding of the paper. For example, 

- citation in latex is wrongly used.
- "are made up of causes of input and of outcome and " rephrase
- "independent of all its other predecessors" Markov definition is more general than discussed here. In addition, predecessors (and some other terms） are not defined formally. 
"unbounded number of plausible models" the number of DAGs is bounded by the number of node in the graph?
- "by removing the effects of any non-causal dependencies between the input and outcome." what is an effect of non-causal dependencies?
- "While also"
-  graphical conditions: they don't seem to include cases where the path contains more than 3 nodes.
- "d-separation between the generative factors  $y_c \perp y_j | Z$ implies conditional independence" independence implies independence?
- The propositions are rather informally stated and contains incomplete statements. Prop 1: what is Z? Prop 2: what does "provides the recipe" mean?
- Prop 3: should it be definition instead. Prop 4: should be assumptions. 
- p(z|x, do(y)) = p(x|z)p(z|do(y)) : it does not hold.
- Z_c: seems like a subset of Z, but also include U. Notation is quite confusing here.
- Eq 10: what is y_c here?

and many more. 

2. Some baselines on causal representation learning is missing. For example, 
"INVARIANT CAUSAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION GENERALIZATION", Lu et al '22, and many baselines within it.

### Questions
- "encoder is set to produce latent vectors the same size as the inputs ": do you assume that the input and latent variables are within the same space?  can one choose a lower dimension?

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose regularization by identification (ReI), an approach to obtain disentangled representations by imposing generative factor disentanglement constraints through causal identification. The authors note the collider bias seen in other approaches to obtain disentangled representations and propose this regularization mechanism to overcome the collider bias. This is achieved by describing disentanglement in terms of d-separation in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Moreover, the authors provide a reformulation of the VAE that adds ReI regularization to the ELBO which keeps the likelihood term intact. Finally, the effects of ReI in removing the effects of collider bias and obtaining disentangled representations are shown in disentanglement benchmarks and a real-world dataset.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a novel approach to obtain disentangled representations. The motivation behind removing the effects of collider bias is clearly explained. The mathematical fundamentals are clearly introduced and motivated with simple examples (though the presentation could further be improved by clarifying the notation used towards the beginning, as the variables sometimes switch during the explanations without a clear framework).
- Applying the method to the real-world dataset obtained from LIBS shows its robustness to OOD samples. Moreover, the fact that ReI could be introduced to the VAE regularizer given by the KL divergence without affecting the likelihood ensures the separability of the two, paving the way for ReI to be applied to additional frameworks, which could be of interest to the community.

### Weaknesses
- It is not clear how the DAG characterizing the causality can be obtained, as it is assumed to be given based on my understanding. In particular, for more complex examples, identifying causal and non-causal dependencies based on the generative factors seems particularly difficult. The same applies to supervisory signals. This is currently the main weakness in the approach in my view.
- In the DCI comparisons, the paper compares the proposed VAE+ReI method with related works such as the $\beta$-VAE. However, as mentioned in the paper, the $\beta$ scalar in $\beta$-VAE (and related approaches compared in the experiments) controls the strength of enforcing the latent prior such that the DCI scores might heavily depend on the selected value. It would be good to see the values selected for the different datasets and the effect of selecting a few different scores on the results (or at least to know that the selected $\beta$ was the best-performing one from a set of values). In addition, it would be good to see the standard deviation of the metrics for the 10 seeds.

### Questions
- As mentioned in the paper, d-separation between the generative factors implies their conditional independence given the set that d-separates them. The absence of d-separation, on the other hand, implies a dependence in almost all distributions compatible with the DAG. When is the dependence not implied through the absence of d-separation and what consequences would it have for the possibility to learn disentangled representations?
