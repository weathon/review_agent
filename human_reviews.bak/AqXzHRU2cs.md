- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Within the evolving landscape of smart homes, the precise recognition of daily living activities using ambient sensor data stands paramount. This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.

### Summary
This paper presents an approach to human activity recognition in smart homes, that is using sensors integrated into a domestic environment to capture human activities. Said activities are then analyzed through a sequin sequential model that is based on sensor embeddings that utilize modeling approaches that are known from the domain of language analysis. The claimed innovation lies in the replacement of ELMO embeddings as they had have been used in previous work with GPT embeddings, and the introduction of contextual, hierarchical activity analysis. The experimental evaluation is based on standard benchmarks, i.e., the CASAS datasets and results are presented in form of balanced accuracies and comparisons are drawn to previous methods that were ELMO based, and a deeper dive into the effectiveness of hierarchical modeling is presented.

### Strengths
This paper operates in an interesting and very relevant application area: Human activity recognition in smart homes has many practical applications, for example, in home automation or in ambient assistant living scenarios. Activity recognition in such environments is inherently challenging due to the unconstrained environment, the noise, ambiguities in both sensor readings and annotations, and many other factors. As such, much progress still needs to be made and I applaud the authors for tackling such an important problem. The paper sets off from a relevant baseline and works with relevant benchmark datasets — as such the presented work in itself is relevant and has the potential to push beyond the state of the art.

### Weaknesses
Despite the general importance of the problem domain that this paper tackles, there are a number of weaknesses with this paper. First, the technical innovation is rather limited. The authors essentially replace one established sensor embedding (ELMO) with another one (GPT). Even the latter one has already been used in previous work (as cited by the authors — Takeda et al. 2023). The authors claim some additional technical improvement, namely the introduction of temporal context and hierarchical processing. While the former seems problematic because, in my opinion, in substantially limits the generalizability of the resulting models (I believe they are vey likely to overfit, which, alas has not been evaluated in detail), the latter seems interesting. The authors are right in stating that flat activity recognition has issues — especially when it comes to the analysis of concurrent activities. Yet, I am not convinced that the presented hierarchical approach would actually alleviate this problem in general as, for example, the incorporation of timestamps into the encoding / representation again limits generalizability substantially. 
I am also concerned about the experimental evaluation — which needs to be described in more detail. From the description of the dataset splits I get the impression that at least some leakage is introduced during model training / hyper parameter tuning? Also: It is not clear to me what the basis for the evaluation is. The authors mention week-wise splits but are the actual continuous sensor readings processed or the pre-segmented activities? I suspect it is the latter (judging by the results on the CASAS datasets [I have substantial experience in working with these] — which is a problem because this would be a rather unrealistic evaluation.
There are also some issues with the presentation: For example it remains unclear what the authors mean by “rhythm of ADL” (which they aim to unveil). 
Finally, I think the claim of causality in general is a bit of a stretch here. Yes, filling up an empty room requires the door to be opened and shut, but activities covered in CASAS do not generally follow this causality principle.

### Questions
1. How exactly are the datasets split for model training and hyperparameter tuning, as well as evaluation? Is there leakage?
2. Are you using pre-segmented activities or are you operating in continuous sensor data streams. Please provide evidence.
3. The improvements in recognition accuracy are barely significant — as per the table, and you only compare to one set of baseline methods. There are other models out there, why not comparing to them?
4. Why using such a rather exotic evaluation measure (balance accuracy) and not the regular macro F1 scores that one should use for such imbalanced datasets?

### Summary
This paper present an approach to human activity recognition (HAR) from ambient sensors in smart home setting. Transformer decoder based pre-trained embedding is proposed, considering hierarchical sequential architecture and time encoding to refine the model. Three long-term activity recognition datasets are benchmarked with promising results.

### Strengths
Paper provides novel combination of existing ideas (pre-trained transformer (GPT-like design, bi-directional LSTM) to build hierarchical model. Based on empirical evaluation it shows the usefulness of the hierarchical modelling of activities. Building blocks are quite-well justified and results are promising; improving some of the issues in previous approach.

### Weaknesses
Paper is application oriented in quite well-defined domain, and is an incremental improvement to a previous study. It lacks "basic" baseline other than GPT/LLM-style of model in comparison. Also, there are some stability issues which might be tackled with the normalisation layer, but that has not been evaluated in practice.

### Questions
- How would "basic" baseline, i.e. hierarchical HMM compared to deep learning models (in this setting)? 
- It would be useful to evaluate further the stability issue of hierarchical models (e.g., using normalisation layer)
- It would be useful to show the confusion matrix of different activities and which are most difficult to discriminate
- Can you discuss about sensor data processing with symbolic representation and how that effect HAR? E.g., continuous temperature
measurements are now transformed to symbolic labels, compared to more traditional sensor signal processing approaches which uses
directly the numerical sensor values.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a multi-time scale architecture aiming to leverage a wider temporal context in a multi-time scale manner. The core problem to solve is classifying sensor event sequences. The temporal order of the sequences are important for reasoning in this application.

### Strengths
The primary contribution of this paper is to leverage Transformer decoder for sensor embedding and hierarchical architecture design. 
These techniques appear to be adaptation of existing methodologies for this domain which hasn't been explored before. The core *technical* contribution could have been a bit more.

### Weaknesses
I have a question and concern about the presentation of the paper. All the tables look like ablation results and collection of different baselines. The entries in the tables aren't clear which one is hierarchical vs which one is not. The captions need to be improved and self-explanatory. I am still confused what's the proposed method? Is the "GPTHAR+Time-encoding" in Table 5? OR, this paper is a review paper. It needed a second read to understand the differences.

### Questions
They have reported only the balanced accuracy metric. It's good to check other metrics such as table 6 or 7 of previous SOTA paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12158.pdf
Are these datasets long-tailed? is the balanced accuracy increasing at the cost of accuracy? 
The annexture provided some of those additional metrics. I'd suggest highlighting the best class per method would be good.

### Summary
The paper presents an approach for temporal human activity detection in smart homes using GPT-based hierarchical model. The authors test their method on 3 datasets

### Strengths
The authors focus an important problem in the context of smart buildings. Activity detection using efficient machine learning methods help achieve occupant comfort and energy efficiency if these inputs are fed to building control mechanism.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors have not covered more on the types of activities captured in the datasets, and their importance in smart homes, particularly from the perspective of occupant comfort and energy efficiency.
2. The number of sensors used to collect data seems a lot. In practice, its not practical to have so many sensors in a home collecting information. The authors should try some benchmarking on a subset of sensors if the dataset permits.
3. How will a sensor fusion approach work in this scenario?
4. What are the motivations behind hierarchical approach?
5. For Milan and Cairo, the temporal method might not be effective since the number of days in the experiment is less.
