# Rethinking Adversarial Policies: A Generalized Attack Formulation and Provable Defense in RL

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Most existing works focus on direct perturbations to the victim's state/action or the underlying transition dynamics to demonstrate the vulnerability of reinforcement learning agents to adversarial attacks. 
However, such direct manipulations may not be always realizable.
In this paper, we consider a multi-agent setting where a well-trained victim agent $\nu$ is exploited by an attacker controlling another 
agent $\alpha$ with an \textit{adversarial policy}. Previous models do not account for the possibility that the attacker may only have partial control over 
$\alpha$ or that the attack may produce easily detectable ``abnormal'' behaviors. Furthermore, there is a lack of provably efficient defenses against these adversarial policies. 
To address these limitations, we introduce a generalized attack framework that has the flexibility to model to what extent the adversary is able to control the agent, and allows the attacker to regulate the state distribution shift and produce stealthier adversarial policies. Moreover, we offer a provably efficient defense with polynomial convergence to the most robust victim policy through adversarial training with timescale separation. 
This stands in sharp contrast to supervised learning, where adversarial training typically provides only \textit{empirical} defenses.
Using the Robosumo competition experiments, we show that our generalized attack formulation results in much stealthier adversarial policies when maintaining the same winning rate as baselines. 
Additionally, our adversarial training approach yields stable learning dynamics and less exploitable victim policies.

### Summary
The paper considers a two-player Markov game where an attacker controls one player to minimize the performance of the victim player. Thus, the game is essentially zero-sum. The setting has been considered in some recent work. The paper considers an extension where a player is partially controlled by the attacker and follows the original policy with a certain probability and the malicious policy otherwise. The paper derives some analytic results regarding the effects of attack budget on attack detectability. It then formulates the victim's problem of minimizing the one-side exploitability, proposes two algorithms, and establishes their convergence.

### Strengths
Previous work on adversarial policies has mainly focused on unconstrained attacks, which can be easily detected. Thus, it makes sense to consider a constrained attacker. The paper shows that the approach leads to stealthier attacks with significantly lower state distribution shifts. 

The paper establishes the convergence of adversarial training with an inner oracle and two-timescale adversarial training for two-player zero-sum Markov games when the attacker is constrained by extending previous results on the unconstrained case, which may find applications in other settings where asymmetric Markov games with constrained followers can be applied

### Weaknesses
It seems that minimizing the so-called one-side exploitability (definition 4.1) is the same as finding the Stackelberg equilibrium, a well-studied concept in game theory and multi-agent RL. Both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 follow the general framework for finding the Stackelberg equilibrium in deep multi-agent RL summarized in Gerstgrasser et al. (2023). The convergence analysis of the two-timescale approach follows Daskalakis et al. (2020) and Zeng et al. (2022). Thus, the technical contribution of the paper seems limited. 

The paper assumes that the original policy \hat{\pi}_alpha of the agent partially controlled by the attacker is fixed so that existing algorithmic and analytic frameworks can be applied. However, this is not a reasonable assumption. Since the agent is playing a game with the victim (even without the attacker), it should adapt its (original) policy against the victim's policy rather than using a fixed policy. 

In Section 3, since the victim's policy is assumed to be fixed, the problem reduces to a single agent MDP, and Propositions 3.1-3.3 are simple variants of well-known results in approximate dynamic programming. Also, I don't see the purpose of mentioning concepts such as generative modeling and distribution matching.

### Questions
Although I agree that directly perturbing the perceived state of an agent is not always feasible in practice, I don't see why controlling another agent against the victim is easier, as claimed in the introduction. They are just different types of attacks. In the air traffic control example, what is the Markov game between the radar system and the commercial drone? 

Although it makes sense to consider a constrained attack model to obtain better stealthiness, the proposed formulation is a bit confusing. In particular, if the agent is only partially controlled by the attacker, there is a three-player game between the victim, the agent partially controlled by the attacker, and the attacker.  In this case, why should the agent adopt a fixed policy without adapting to the victim's policy? 

In Figure 1, it says that an unconstrained adversarial policy and a constrained policy with the same winning rate are chosen. How is this achieved? Also, is the same victim policy used in both cases? Intuitively, a smaller epsilon should produce a lower state distribution shift and a stealthier attack, but at the same time, the victim's (best possible) performance should improve, given that the attacker becomes weaker.

### Summary
This paper investigates adversarial attacks in multi-agent environments. Specifically, it considers a two-agent environment where one agent is controlled (hijacked) by an adversary, with the goal of minimizing the other agent's cumulative reward. The paper introduces the idea of a reduced capacity attack, where the adversary can only control the action of the hijacked adversary at each time step with a probability p. The paper derives a bound on policy discrepancy given p and investigates the stealthiness of an attack for a given p, where stealthiness is defined either as variation in the induced state distribution or as variation in the conditional transition dynamics. The paper then investigates adversarial training with timescale separation to achieve provably robust victim policies and derives a convergence bound that is polynomial with respect to the size of the state and action space. The paper then verifies the stealthiness of the proposed attack and the exploitability of robustified victim policies in two benchmark environments.

### Strengths
- the paper studies a very valid scenario for adversarial attacks in multi-agent systems
- the derived bounds on policy similarity, state distribution and conditional transition probabilities are insightful
- the conducted experiments indicate that their attacks are more stealthy than prior work
- the conducted experiments indicate that the robustification of victim policies results in significantly improved exploitability of victim agents

### Weaknesses
- Stealthiness is defined as the difference in state distributions. This is a step in the right direction and seems like a good proxy for real-world problems. However, two identical state distributions can come from very different trajectories (e.g. just inverting the order of states within all trajectories does not change the state distribution). This should be considered and discussed in more detail.
- The empirical results wrt stealthiness are very limited. Only three videos are provided for the qualitative comparison. A larger study and/or quantitative results would much improve the paper.
- The theoretical results are interesting, but the applicability of the given bounds to larger environments remains unclear.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new attack formulation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, where an attacker can have partial control over agent  $\alpha$ to attack against a well-trained victim agent $v$. The paper highlights the limitations of existing attack models and proposes a more generalized attack framework that takes into account the level of attack budget and the attack model’s detectability. The paper offers a provably efficient defense with polynomial convergence to the most robust victim policy through adversarial training with timescale separation. The empirical results on two standard environment,: Kuhn Poker and RoboSumo, showcasing the proposed attack algorithm's effectiveness.

### Strengths
The proposed attack framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning takes into account the level of control the attacker has over the agent by introducing an "attack budget". This attack budget characterizes the partial control of the attacker and regulates the strength of the attacker in degrading the victim's performance. Regulating the attack budget allows us to manage the discrepancy between the state distributions and the transition dynamics before and after the attack, allowing for more stealthy attacks. The paper is well-written and presents the concepts, definitions, and analyses. A provably efficient defense with polynomial convergence have practical implications for the application of the proposed adversarial training.

### Weaknesses
In my understanding, the novelty of the paper is mainly the "partial control" and "attack budget", compared with the previous work: Gleave et al. (2019); Wu et al. (2021b); Guo et al. (2021). However, the partial control is previously introduced in PR-MDP, Tessler et al. (2019). 

The motivation of the attack budget and partial control is not enough convincing. From the attack side, it is true that the setting of attack budget can improve the stealthiness, but it is hard to say that the proposed attack is optimal subject to the limitation of the discrepancy between the state distributions (or marginalized transition dynamics). From the side of the defense (adversarial training), there is no insight into the choice of the defense budget which is the budget used to train the robust victim. What is the benefit of introducing this defense budget? More discussion would be helpful.

The result in Figure 1 is confusing. 1. Why the bottom-right subfigure is empty? 2. Is original state distribution means that the distribution without any attack? If it is true, should not the original state distribution be same in the bottom and top subfigures? The original state distributions in top-mid and bottom-mid subfigures are different. Could you explain the reason? 3. Where do the results in Figure 1 come from? The paper only mentions that two attack polices are assessed under the same winning rate. However, according to the Figure 6, the unconstrained policy has higher wining rate.

### Summary
The paper studies RL in an adversarial setting. In particular, the focus is on multi- (specifically 2) agent setting in which an agent $\alpha$ has the goal of harming the other agent $\nu$. So, the goal of $\nu$ is to find the most return (based on the discount factor $\lambda$) while $\alpha$ aims to the opposite direction for $\nu$.

The paper then models a form of "budget" for the adversarial agent, but letting them impose a policy that is a probabilistic (linear) combination of the original (non-adversarial) policy and a fully malicious adversarial one. So, a parameter $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ is introduced here to control this budget.

Some initial (proposition) results are proved showing that with small $\epsilon$, the effect of adversary's strategy is limited (which is expected, but proving them formally is not completely trivial).

The paper then aims at designing a form of adversarial training. They propose a method with "two separated timescale" meaning that the optimization is done in iterations between two types of operations. In one type of operation one fixes the adversary's strategy and optimizes the victim policy, and then switches to to the opposite.

The paper proves converges properties for their defense, and then move to do experiments to show the capability of the defense in different senses (such as convergence and robustness of the final policy).

### Strengths
Studying RL's robustness in the multi-agent setting is a natural in interesting problem. The formulation is clean and the proposed defense is analyzed well, both theoretically and experimentally.

### Weaknesses
Despite numerous references to previous work, there is no clean depicted picture of how this work on multi agent robustness fits in the context of previous work. I am not complaining for lack of references here, I just think the presentation should be more clear.

Some corrections needed (see comments below as well).

some example of typos:
Def 5.1 : "has" -> 'have"

paragraph "(c) Connection to action adversarial RL." in page 4, has "\tilde{\pi}\alpha" in which alpha needs to be the index.

Definition 5.2. : please give an intuition of what this is, before giving a full line math formula.

### Questions
You say "performance. This contrasts with supervised learning attacks, where small perturbations can result in large performance shifts." but this seems to be only applicable to test time attacks, as poisoning has a limited effect if it is limited to eps-fraction of data (e.g, ERM will be effected by eps increase in its probability of error as well).

When you say "However, it has been demonstrated that while re-training against a specific adversarial policy does augment robustness against it, the performance against other policies may be compromised." what is the reference?
