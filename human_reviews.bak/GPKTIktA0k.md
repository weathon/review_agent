# The Reversal Curse: LLMs trained on “A is B” fail to learn “B is A”

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form ''_A_ is _B_'', it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction ''_B_ is _A_''. This is the **Reversal Curse**. For instance, if a model is trained on ''Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space'', it will not automatically be able to answer the question, ''Who was the first woman to travel to space?''. Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer (''Valentina Tershkova'') will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set: if ''_A_ is _B_'' occurs, ''_B_ is _A_'' is more likely to occur. It is worth noting, however, that if ''_A_ is _B_'' appears _in-context_, models can deduce the reverse relationship. 

We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as ''Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of _Abyssal Melodies_'' and showing that they fail to correctly answer ''Who composed _Abyssal Melodies?_''. The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation.

We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as ''Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]'' and the reverse ''Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?''. GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79\% of the time, compared to 33\% for the latter.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper studies the **reversal curse** phenomenon that LLMs trained on sentences "A is B" will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". Specifically, the authors manually construct the datasets to fine-tune the models, and test the performance on datasets of the opposite direction.

### Strengths
I pretty much that the paper of its straightforward yet insightful observation. The experimental settings are clean and clear, and the authors have demonstrated this phenomenon under a variety of models and datasets, showing the generality of the claim. Overall, I am happy to learn this new observation, and will be happy to see more understanding of the direction.

### Weaknesses
I currently give a score of 6. However, if the following questions can be appropriately addressed, I am more than willing to increase my score.

- I want to learn more about the underlying mechanism of this curse: is it more of a "pattern" shift (style), or is it because of the lack of "knowledge" (content)? What happens is you prompt the model "logically speaking, if <name> is <description>, then it is true that <description> is <name>", and then ask the questions you currently prepare? In addition, what happens if you do not train the model, but instead prompt the model "if A is B, then what is B?" (here A and B is the concrete entity and description). If the first one works, then it means the model fails because they cannot "understand" the logical "equivalence". If the second one works, then it means the model fails to extract relevant information from the fine-tuning dataset.
- Another possible thing to try is the performance of LLMs' latent embeddings. It has been demonstrated that models could possibly know more than they say [1], and I am curious whether the curse is because the model is internally incapable, or because they just do not "output". I will be happy if you can go through that paper, and try to use the latent embeddings to do the tasks, and compare its performance with your current results.
- While unnecessary, I do hope the authors discuss more about why this happens, and what can we do to address the problems. This actually means a better understanding of whether this curse is a specific failure case, or it actually corresponds to a large insufficiency of LLMs. Either way, it will tell people a lot.

### Confidence

### Summary
This paper raised an issue with current autoregressive models that they suffer from the "reverse curse": it recognizes "A is B", but cannot infer "B is A". The authors conduct three experiments to show this phenomenon exists across different settings.

### Strengths
The phenomenon described by the paper is quite interesting and can motivate more future research in this direction. The presentation and delivery of the paper is very clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
I have some questions with respect to the experiment settings (see details in the following question section). The author mentioned the reverse-curse doesn't happen with in-context learning, but the paper did not discuss in further detail (I think it would be a great baseline for your experiments).

### Questions
1. Experiments 1 and 3 both have some distribution shifts. For example, in experiment 1, the training documents are regular texts, but the evaluation is done in QA format; I can make the same argument for experiment 3. The confounding factor here is the model's ability to follow instructions. A fairer way that decouple the confounding factor will be you train with "Daphne Barrington is the director of A Journey Through Time", and test with "The director of A Journey through Time is __", and let the model complete the sentence. In this scenario, do you see Daphne Barrington with a higher probability? I found the results in Figure 4 surprising that the probabilities are so indistinguishable. I wonder how much distribution shift contributes.
2. In section 2.1.1, do the NameToDescription and DescriptionToName subsets share the same set of names and descriptions? In the "Both" subset, you mentioned they are in separate documents. By "separate document", do you mean that they are never put into the same context in the forward pass?
3. As I mentioned in the previous section, does the model almost always get the reverse question right, if the original statement is put in context?
4. In the paragraph above section 2.3, you mentioned you used Llama1 which has not been finetuned. Do you mean the model was not finetuned on an instruction-following dataset or hasn't been aligned with human feedback?
5. On top of page 3, you mention "if the former appears in a dataset, the latter is more likely to appear", is this claim supported statistically?

### Summary
This paper coins the term, presents and analyzes the phenomena called the Reversal Curse. Authors define Reversal Curse as a property of LLMs that, when presented with "A is B" statement, fail to generalize it into "B is A" statement. The paper demonstrates this by running experiments using fictional statements, such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies".
Authors finetune the model on these sentence, then ask the model to reply to a "B is A" question, such as "Who composed Abyssal Melodies?". Authors finetune a range of OpenAI models of different scale and type (general LLM or chat assistant). To further explore this phenomena, the paper also reports different evaluations using real world facts (2.2) and instructions (3.x). Based on those observations, authors extrapolate several general properties of LLMs (e.g. p.3 "We show that auto-regressive LLMs are not good meta-learners in this sense").

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an important practical problem. As our society relies on LLMs in more and more various tasks, it is worth analyzing what are those systems capable of doing.

2. The paper demonstrates an interesting set of observations. I have significant doubts about the conclusions drawn from those observations (see below),  but the observation [that fine-tuning GPT systems fails in the proposed way produces models that do not generalize to the inverse]  -- is valuable in and of itself.

3. Authors found ingenious ways to test their hypothesis, e.g. using fictitious statements. Commendably, authors also evaluate if their method is robust to the choice of input prompts.

4. The supplementary material goes to reasonable lengths to make the experiments reproducible. While some irreproducibility is inherent in using closed-source models (e.g. if openai updates chatGPT after publication), authors took all necessary precautions to ensure that the open-source bits of the code are easy to understand and run. I lament the fact that authors chose not to release the code to reproduce experiments with open-source models (supplementary README.md, line 18), as it was the only experiment that does not have conceptual reproducibility problems -- but that does not affect my evaluation.

The paper is also generally well written and easy to follow. The presentation is further improved by well-designed figures.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with the paper is that it makes general claims that are, arguably, not sufficiently verified or investigated.  On page 2, authors state that

> Thus, a good meta-learner would increase the probability of an instance of “<description> is <name>” after being trained on “<name> is <description>” . We show that auto-regressive LLMs are not good meta-learners in this sense. 

Authors do show that fine-tuning GPT models using a OpenAI's undisclosed algorithm leads to poor performance on "reversed questions" --- and that LLaMA models show simlar behavior in another experiment set (unfortunately, the fine-tuning setup is also not mentioned). However, that does not necessarily mean that LLMs are bad at this task. Below I attempt to formulate a counterfactual edge case to illustrate my concern.


As authors state earlier,
> The Reversal Curse does not apply for in-context learning. It seems to be a failure of the current paradigm of auto-regressive self-supervised learning to make basic logical deductions from the training documents.

To the best of my knowledge, several popular PEFT tunes can exactly reproduce the results of in-context learning: prompt- and prefix-tuning[1,2,3], autoprompt[4] and similar. For instance, in prompt tuning, setting "soft prompts" to exactly mimic the embeddings of in-context learning prompts would produce mathematically equivalent results to in-context learning --- and, as authors claim (and as I also observed when reproducing the results), the model can properly generalize from "A is B" to  "B is A" with in-context learning.

To construct a more specific counterfactual, we can use the following procedure:

1. Take a sufficiently powerful open-source LLM (I used StableBeluga-2 70B[5] )
2. Ensure that it can solve description reversal with in-context learning (in my case: https://i.imgur.com/J6B4hye.png , https://i.imgur.com/dI2T5Ot.png , https://i.imgur.com/yzl2G0I.png ; the screenshots are anonymous sessions from htps://chat.petals.dev [6] )
3. Initialize prompt tuning with as many soft prompts as there were tokens during in-context learning
4. Train those prompts by context distillation [7] on that one specific task until it the student model without in-context prompts exactly matches the original model with in-context prompts.

The intent behind this procedure is to produce exactly the same outputs as in-context learning (where model has no Reversal Curse) within the "auto-regressive self-supervised learning" setting outlined in the paper. Please note that context distillation[1] is explicitly both auto-regressive and self-supervised, and the soft-prompt parameters[1] are updated by backprop with the same optimizer and hyperparameters as in the original paper, except that there is one training sequence.

* [7] https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15189 

The above procedure produces exactly the same outputs as in shown in anonymized screenshots from Step 2.
I ran several similar sanity checks using 20 random examples from [supplementary materials]/reversal_curse-anonymous/data/reverse_experiments/june_version_7921032488/all.json file , repeating each evaluation 3 times. Model produces correct results in 51 out of 60 (20x3) total evaluations. In 35 of them, the model produced a short sentence with the correct answer right away. In 16 of them, the model produced a long response that contains the correct answer, then I prompted it to write a short answer and it answered correctly. In the remaining 9, the model did not produce the required answer right away and failed to produce a short_and_correct it after one extra turn. In all 9 cases, the "teacher" in-context model also failed to produce the correct outputs, and the student learned to repeat teacher's error.
 
Based on the experiments presented in the paper and the counterfactual, there could be many possible explanations,

0. it is entirely possible that I accidentally found a "lucky" outlier case or misunderstood something - please explain.
1. Hypothesis A: when fine-tuning the full LLM parameters, it is easier for it to memorize the words without "understanding" the statement. The SGD follows the steepest path to the optimum. In contrast, prompt-tuning can only affect attention layers and may be less affected.
2. Hypothesis B: when fine-tuning the model to minimize crossentropy loss with hard labels, the loss function forces the model to memorize the exact words, also "without understanding" the statement. Context distillation uses "soft" labels (teacher's probability distribution) and thereby circumvents the problem.
3. Hypothesis C: the fine-tuning procedure solves a (relatively) harder problem that updates the LLM enough times to break something about it. Context distillation solves a relatively easier problem, converges in very few steps and does not break it.

Naturally, there can be more potential explanations. Since I only have a surface level familiarity with this paper's materials, I would trust authors' interpretation over my own.


**Please note that I do not doubt any of the evaluations in the paper.** On the contrary, I managed to reproduce two random experiments using the supplementary code and OpenAI API.
This is merely an example to illustrate that statements like "We show that auto-regressive LLMs are not good meta-learners in this sense" (see p.2 for context) is an overly general claim. 
My point is that the Reversal Curse phenomena can be more complicated than stated in the paper - to the extent that some of the stated claims are false in edge cases.  As authors admit on p.9, it is difficult to rigorously prove a strong negative result. I would argue that it would be better to make a more specific claim, e.g. that a specific fine-tuning setup has that property for a range of models --- as long as that claim can be properly verified within the scope of the paper.

### Questions
To reiterate, it is entirely possible that I misunderstood the intent behind experiment 2.1 or found a "lucky" outlier case. If authors believe I misunderstood it, please explain the nature of this misunderstanding.

If there is no misunderstanding, I would appreciate if authors could provide a more detailed analysis and describe which specific properties of their fine-tuning procedure are responsible for the reversal curse, and whether or not they are specific to LLMs.

### Summary
The paper studies the limitation of auto-regressive models in deducting the logical statement of ‘B is A’ at inference time if it was trained on ‘A is B’. This is coined the Reversal Curve in the paper. This exhibits a logical inconsistency in LLM knowledge. To prove that, experiments have been conducted to verify the reversal curve: 1) fine-tuning LLMs on ‘A is B’ and testing generalization on ‘B is A’. 2) Testing on celebrities facts by prompting with reverse questions. 3) fine-tune LLMs on question-answering instructions of the form “Respond with <answer> when you see <question>” and test generalization to “Q: <question> A: <answer>”. The experiments reveal the large drop of performance in LLM when prompted in reverse scenarios.

### Strengths
- Understanding the weakness of transformer-based models is an important topic as many areas in the field could benefit from it.
- The paper proposes a series of rigorous experiments and statistical testing to validate the reversal curve hypothesis.

### Weaknesses
- The fine-tuning dataset are rather limited in size. 
- Previous work has pointed the reversal issue. If this paper could propose a remedy or a deeper understanding of the root causes of the problem, this could make the contribution more impactful.

### Questions
- I wonder whether the conducted supervised fine tuning experiment is more appropriate than a further pretraining (unsupervised) experiment using reversed examples. In this way you maintain the same training paradigm. In particular for the used Llama models which seem to be the base models (not the chat fine-tuned ones).  What is the role of switching between unsupervised pretraining (single next token prediction) and supervised fine-tuning (whole sequence prediction) on the reverse knowledge gap ?
- GPT-4 using a browsing option is already able to provide correct answer for some reverse prompts I tried on celebrities. Would knowledge-connected LLMs solve the reversal curve ?
