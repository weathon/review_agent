- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 6, 4

## Abstract
This work focuses on the end-to-end forecast of global extreme marine heatwaves (MHWs), which are unusually warm sea surface temperature events with profound impacts on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations in forecasting general patterns and extreme events. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel hybrid data-driven and numerical MHWs forecast framework Ocean-E2E, which is capable of 40-day accurate MHW forecasting with end-to-end data assimilation. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of MHWs by explicitly modeling the effect of oceanic mesoscale advection and air-sea interaction based on a dynamic kernel. Furthermore, Ocean-E2E is capable of end-to-end MHWs forecast and regional high-resolution prediction, allowing our framework to operate completely independently of numerical models while outperforming the current state-of-the-art ocean numerical/AI forecasting-assimilation models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs excellently on global-to-regional scales and short-to-long-term forecasts, especially in those most extreme MHWs. Overall, our model provides a framework for forecasting and understanding MHWs and other climate extremes.

### Summary
This paper proposes Ocean-E2E, a hybrid model for global and regional forecasting of marine heatwaves (MHWs). The system integrates physical ocean dynamics and neural networks in two key components: (1) a hybrid physics-AI forecast model that represents mesoscale advection and air-sea heat exchange via neural approximations of physical equations, and (2) a neural assimilation module that reconstructs initial fields from sparse observations using attention-based networks.

### Strengths
The paper offers an integrated treatment of data assimilation and forecasting within one end-to-end framework, directly coupling neural operators with simplified physical kernels. The hybridization is physically grounded and shows awareness of fluid dynamics principles.

### Weaknesses
- The “hybrid physics + AI” idea is now well-established (e.g., ClimODE, DiffDA), and this work mostly repackages these ideas in the marine heatwave setting with different parameterizations. The method extends known hybridization and neural DA approaches rather than introducing fundamentally new architectures or learning principles.

- The model combines many moving parts: four neural submodules (forecast, assimilation, atmosphere, and ocean currents), multiple pretrained components, and nested equations: but provides minimal insight into why this integration leads to improvement. There is little analysis of sensitivity, error propagation, or interpretability of the learned dynamics.

- While multiple datasets and baselines are reported, the analysis is largely quantitative (RMSE/CSI) and lacks physical diagnostics, such as conservation checks, energy spectra, or feature attribution. Results could be inflated by tuning or preprocessing differences; no uncertainty estimates or robustness tests are included.

- The assimilation process uses “Kirsch-guided reparameterization”  but lacks ablation or comparison to established data assimilation networks (e.g., 4DVarNet, EnKF emulators). It’s not obvious whether the learned mapping generalizes or if it’s tightly tied to this specific training data distribution.

### Summary
This paper presents Ocean-E2E, an end-to-end hybrid physics–data-driven framework for forecasting global extreme marine heatwaves (MHWs). The model integrates numerical ocean dynamics with deep learning through a dynamic kernel that explicitly represents mesoscale ocean advection and air–sea interactions, enabling accurate 40-day MHW forecasts. Furthermore, the authors introduce a neural data assimilation module that directly maps sparse observations to analysis fields, reducing the computational cost of traditional assimilation schemes. Experiments conducted across global and regional scales demonstrate that Ocean-E2E significantly outperforms both numerical and AI-based state-of-the-art forecasting–assimilation models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

### Strengths
* Innovative Hybrid Framework Design: The paper proposes a physics-informed end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively bridges physical constraints with data-driven prediction. The integration of dynamic kernels and neural networks is well-motivated and clearly explained.

* Efficient Data Assimilation: The proposed deep learning–based assimilation mechanism efficiently combines sparse observations with background states, greatly reducing computational overhead compared to traditional DA methods.

* Scientific and Practical Impact: Provides physical interpretability in understanding MHW dynamics. Offers high practical value for applications in marine ecosystem management and climate-risk prediction.

### Weaknesses
* The paper lacks details on how the baselines in Table 1 incorporate atmospheric forcing as a conditioning input. Models such as SimVP or U-Net, listed as baselines, typically predict 𝐶𝑡 from 𝐶0 without considering external forcings. It is therefore recommended that the authors clarify how atmospheric forcing is integrated into each baseline for a fair comparison.

* The clarity of implementation details could be further improved — see the Questions section for specific points that would benefit from additional explanation.

### Questions
* For grid-based models such as UNet or ClimODE, how do the authors handle ocean data with irregular land–sea boundaries? Since these models typically take rectangular gridded inputs, how are they adapted to represent ocean domains with complex coastlines?

* In the ocean simulation, what is the temporal interval between prediction steps? Should all atmospheric variables within the interval be used as conditioning inputs? It would be helpful to include a table summarizing the prediction intervals used for both atmospheric and oceanic components.

* The models 𝑀𝜃 and 𝑁𝜃 are said to be pre-trained. Are they jointly trained with 𝑆𝜃 during fine-tuning, and do their parameters update simultaneously?

* During data assimilation, how many observation points and satellite measurements are used within each selected assimilation time window?

* In Equation (22), why is the atmospheric field 𝐴0:𝑡 included as a condition when generating the background field? Shouldn’t the corresponding atmospheric state be at time –t instead?

* How exactly are the in-situ observation data used in the assimilation process? Please clarify their integration method and contribution to the final state estimation.

This is a good paper. If the authors can address my questions and adequately respond to the identified weaknesses, I would be very willing to raise my score to 8 or even 10.

### Summary
The paper studies the prediction of heatwaves at the surface of the sea by using neural networks which are designed to remplace the solving of some of the equations for the actual dynamics of the physical fields. More specifically, the two tasks of assimilating observations (to estimate global fields which can be used as initial conditions for simulations) and predicting the time evolution, are addressed by introducing 4 specific neural networks that remplace classical PDE solvers. 

The article is quite well organized to understand the rationales from the physics of formulating then problem in the way the paper is doing it. Using the dynamical equation for the evolution of the sea surface temperature (eq 2 to 6) would solve the problem, but for the initial condition (hence the need of data assimilation) and some missing elements of the models. The proposed NN approach fills these gaps and it makes use of 4 neural networks : to predict the evolution of the atmosphere variables (eq 16) ; to forecast (and model) the evolution of geostrophic velocity (eq 15) ; to model source of heat flux (eq. 13) and to model subgrid and subsurface contribution to adjective transport (eq. 11).

With all that, forecast using these models to remplace some PDE’s  and a straightforward data assimilation method, allows the authors to have a method to predict the evolution of sea surface temperature anomaly, and possibly detect marine heatwaves. The long section 3 is devoted to numerical experiments to assess whether the proposed method Ocean-E2E works well or not.

### Strengths
The strengths of the article are : 

1. The general framework appears to be solid and, as far as I know, novel. 

2. The NN methods are not black boxes, but are really elements which aim at remplacing unknown elements that could be modelled only by ad-hoc behaviours, by a NN model which proposes a sort of data-driven modelling. 

3. The results for the numerical experiments appear to be good and solid. As far as I know, because…. See the next box.

### Weaknesses
As it is currently written, the paper has some weaknesses for the inclusion in this  conference:
1. The presentation seems to be tailored for people from oceanography, more than people from machine learning. The work is on a specific questions of forecasting + data assimilation in numerical oceanographical model, but without any attempt to see what would be general for other dynamical systems.

2. In 2.2, we don’t  know where the equations come from; there isn’t any reference in fact for them. If one does nothing about modeling of sea / atmosphere of the earth, one will not know what geostrophic velocity is. We don’t know if the equation would be the same for the SST as for the SSTA here. In fact, we don’t have a clear definition of what is the anomaly w.r.t. SST ? (in 3.1, it is said that the seasonal cycle has been removed: no consequence of that on the time derivatives ? Also, is it a seasonal cycle per pixel ? or a spatially averaged one ?)

3. A key point appears to be the lack of understanding about what happens under the surface. This appears to be the point fo the GM90 parametrisation and step 1. Would it be possible to know something about subsurface dynamics, or even average profiles ? Also, is actually a marine heatwave only characterize by the SST (or SSTA) ? Nothing from the subsurface temperature ? 

4. It is strange to spend most of the presentation to derive the equations in physics (with only scarce references), which will not be really discussed in this community, while elements about the learning parts are only in the appendix. For all the models, one would like to know if some specific choices are important, if a model is better than another, and so on.



5. The two steps of training (for M and N, and later for S and u) should be justified. Any insight about why it has to be that way ? And does it lead to a stable numerical procedure ?

### Questions
Other remarks :

The redaction of the line before eq. (14) is not good practice (it’s better to state that with words).

* Figure 1 is too small to be readable

* IN Eq (7), there are missing parenthesis.

* There should be a list or a table somewhere of the various (4 ?) neural networks models used, their main features

* For the NN model of eq. (11):; why are C and u_h the sole input variables ? Any explanation  ? 
* In 3.2; the choice of using CSI as performance index should be discussed in the main text (and the metric should be defined there; it’s not possible to postpone so many thing to the appendices).

* For Table 3, one would expect to see also what happens if N (for the dynamics of A) is changed to a PDE solver instead.

* For 3.6: why isn’y the simulation stable ? Could it be made stable by modelling better the flows (and damping by hand with a GM velocity  or mitigating the numerical instabilities ? Here, we lack some baseline of pure numerical modelling. We miss also a comparison of the time and memory load of the method, compared to classical numerical approaches.
