# Nef-Net v2: Adapting Electrocardio Panorama in the wild

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 2, 6

## Abstract
Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac signals
from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement. However, cer-
tain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard
viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard
leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced
to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of
ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite
its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild
challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific
signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents
NEF-NET V2, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that
supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across
ECG devices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode place-
ment. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that
performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline
pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step
for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthe-
sis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench,
comprising 4470 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial
variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET
V2 delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around
6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. Our data and code are publicly available at

### Summary
The paper proposes NEF-NET+, a geometry-aware ECG transformation model that replaces field reconstruction with a direct view-to-view learning strategy. 
It introduces a multi-stage adaptation pipeline to improve real-world robustness. 
A new 48-view dataset, Panobench, is constructed for spatially precise evaluation of cross-lead ECG reconstruction.

### Strengths
- The combination of direct view transformation and geometry-aware attention effectively captures spatial lead dependencies while simplifying the modeling pipeline.
- The three-stage calibration framework is well-aligned with real-world ECG acquisition and device variability.
- The proposed 48-view Panobench dataset expands the spatial evaluation scope beyond traditional 12-lead ECGs

### Weaknesses
- Limited Validation of Geometry-Aware Attention: While the MGAA and GeoVT modules are claimed to model inter-lead angular relationships, the paper lacks quantitative evidence that these mechanisms genuinely capture geometric or biophysical correspondence. 
While the geometry-aware mechanism is formally defined and integrated into the architecture, the paper does not present attention-weight visualizations nor any correlation analysis between learned attention weights and actual spatial distances or electric potential gradients.

- Lack of Clinical Interpretability: The performance evaluation relies heavily on signal reconstruction metrics, which do not directly reflect diagnostic or physiological relevance. 
The absence of task-oriented evaluation metrics limits the interpretability and translational value of the proposed framework in clinical contexts.

- Computational Efficiency and Deployment Feasibility: Although the architecture simplifies the overall transformation pipeline, the paper does not quantify the practical cost of on-the-fly calibration, which requires per-examination adaptation. 
The manuscript does not report time-to-adapt (wall-clock latency from raw input to an adapted model), compute/memory budget for the calibration step on realistic hardware, or convergence stability under streaming/telemetry conditions. 
This omission makes it difficult to assess whether the per-patient adaptation loop can meet real-time throughput constraints in clinical workflows and whether maintaining adapted parameters across encounters is feasible on resource-constrained medical devices.

- Limited Accessibility of the Panobench Dataset: While the appendix provides detailed descriptions of the Panobench dataset and its construction process, the dataset itself is not publicly available at the time of writing. 
Given that Panobench serves as a central contribution and evaluation benchmark, the lack of open access limits reproducibility and independent verification of the reported results (the paper only states that code and data “will also be released publicly”).

### Summary
The paper introduces Nef-Net+, an enhanced framework for panoramic ECG synthesis. The model supports arbitrary-length signal generation from any desired view, aims to generalize across different ECG devices, and compensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. To evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, the authors also present Panobench, a new benchmark dataset including 9,369 recordings with 48 views per subject, designed to capture the spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity.

### Strengths
1) The paper addresses an important practical limitation of ECG modeling, i.e., the restricted number of observation viewpoints, and proposes an architectural improvement over Nef-Net.

2) The Panobench dataset could be of interest to the biomedical ML community.

### Weaknesses
1) **The paper does not align with the conference scope**. The contribution is highly domain-specific and would be more appropriate for an applied or benchmark-oriented venueApplied/Benchmark track conference.

2) Several paragraphs are written in a dense and overly technical style (e.g., 068-071, 152-155). A clearer presentation of the original Nef-Net architecture would greatly help to understand the improvements introduced in Nef-Net+, since the latter builds directly upon the former. For instance, the description of “direct view-to-view transformation” versus “neural electrocardio field reconstruction” (lines 140-142) it is important but not explained.

3) Weak evaluation (see *Questions*).

4) The discussion of related work on ECG reconstruction is limited and overlooks several recent and top-tier contributions in this area, to cite a few:

### Questions
1) Could the authors clarify what exactly *device heterogeneity* refers to in their experiments? It looks like by heterogeneity, they mean data from different datasets. 

2) Was the Panobench dataset curated or validated by medical professionals? 

3) How were the ECG datasets preprocessed before training? The paper combines recordings with different sampling frequencies (1000/500/250 Hz) and signal durations. Details regarding signal preprocessing are fundamental but completely missing from the paper.

4) What is the rationale for using SSIM as an evaluation metric? Standard metrics exist for ECG synthesis and reconstruction (e.g., see [1, 2, 3]). A morphological analysis of ECG features such as peaks, waves, and segments would also be necessary to assess clinical fidelity. In addition, no statistical information (e.g., standard deviations) is reported for the quantitative results.
 
5) It is unclear whether the experiments are conducted at the heartbeat level (as in the original Nef-Net) or on continuous ECG recordings. If the latter is the case, it becomes unclear how a fair comparison with Nef-Net is ensured, since that model was evaluated on single-beat reconstructions.

6) The paper repeatedly states that Nef-Net+ supports *arbitrary-length ECG synthesis*. How is this implemented in practice? Are sequences chunked, streamed, or processed recurrently?

### Summary
The paper presents Nef-Net+, an improved version of Nef-Net for synthesizing panoramic ECG signals from arbitrary viewpoints, addressing limitations like single-heartbeat modeling, device variability, and electrode placement errors through a new geometry-aware architecture and a three-stage workflow (pretraining, device calibration, on-the-fly calibration).
It also introduces Panobench, a new 48-view ECG dataset with CT-derived coordinates for benchmarking. While the enhancements show promising improvements in signal quality metrics (PSNR and SSIM), the evaluation lacks clinical validation, broader comparisons, and deeper analysis of the method's physiological fidelity, raising questions about its real-world diagnostic utility.

### Strengths
- The study is already established on a sound baseline work, and the treatment and the introduction of a geometry-aware cross-attention mechanism (GeoVT) and query-guided feature encoding are shown to be a reasonable solution, effectively addressing the limitations
of uniform feature averaging in prior work, leading to better handling of sparse views and improved synthesis quality.

- The three-stage workflow is a practical, enabling adaptation to device heterogeneity and patient-specific variations, which are critical for clinical deployment.

- Panobench represents a valuable new benchmark with dense 48-view recordings and precise angular annotations, filling a gap in existing datasets and facilitating more comprehensive evaluation of panoramic ECG methods.

- The visual schematics are highly informative and effectively showcases the methodology with clear annotations.

### Weaknesses
o The paper claims robustness to "in-the-wild" challenges but tests primarily on controlled datasets; real-world noise (e.g., motion  artifacts, baseline wander) is not explicitly simulated or evaluated beyond angular deviations.

o The evaluation relies heavily on PSNR and SSIM, which measure signal similarity but do not assess clinical relevance, such as the preservation of diagnostic features (e.g., arrhythmia detection or pathology-specific waveforms). Other potential metrics, like sensitivity/specificity for disease classification on synthesised signals, could strengthen claims of clinical utility.

o Comparisons are limited to Nef-Net and a few others (KIM and E-LSTM); the paper does not benchmark against other recent ECG synthesis methods (e.g., GAN-based or transformer-based approaches cited in related work), potentially overstating the novelty and superiority of NEF-NET+.

o Panobench has limited demographic diversity (subjects aged 18-28), which may not capture variations in older populations or those with comorbidities, limiting generalizability. Additionally, the dataset size (9360 recordings) is substantial but lacks details on
pathological distribution beyond basic categories.

o The on-the-fly calibration uses only the first 5 seconds of a 10-second recording, assuming stability; however, this may not hold for arrhythmic or dynamic ECGs, and no sensitivity analysis is provided for calibration duration or failure cases. This may highlight potential
ablation studies in this direction.

### Questions
o Can the authors elaborate on the rationale for employing the dipole approximation from cardiac vector theory as the foundational model, and discuss how NEF-NET+ accounts for potential higher-order multipolar contributions in scenarios involving complex cardiac
pathologies?

o Regarding the GeoVT module, the utilization of a shared Geometric Angular Attention (GAA) map across all blocks implies an assumption of static angular similarity; could this constrain the model's capacity to handle temporal variations in cardiac electrical activity, and were alternative dynamic attention mechanisms explored during development?

o Please provide details on the initialization and optimization strategy for the angular deviation parameters (dθ, dφ) in the on-the-fly calibration phase, including measures implemented to mitigate overfitting to the initial 5-second segment under conditions of signal noise or variability.

o In Table 4, the observed performance improvements vary across disease categories (e.g., relatively modest gains for LBBB); what factors might contribute to these disparities, and do they suggest inherent limitations in the model's representation of specific conduction
disorders?

o Could the authors explain the absence of assessments for downstream applications, such as leveraging synthesized ECG signals to enhance diagnostic model training or conducting clinician-led perceptual fidelity studies?

o Appendix E.2 demonstrates the efficacy of calibration for angular deviations up to 30°; what is the documented range of electrode placement errors in clinical practice, and how does the model's performance scale for deviations exceeding this threshold?
