# Breaking the Gridlock: Efficient Atmospheric Data Reconstruction and Prediction via Generative 3D Gaussian Splatting

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 4

## Abstract
AI-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often rely on regular latitude–longitude grids that induce strong data redundancy, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and wasting computation. We present $\textit{GaussianCast}$, a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework for compact, continuous representation and efficient forecasting of high-dimensional atmospheric fields. To reduce redundancy while preserving global consistency, we place Gaussian centers on a Reduced Gaussian Grid (RGG), achieving equal-area sampling and enabling up to 14× compression. Conditioned on the current atmospheric state, multi-scale Graph Attention Transformers generate 3DGS covariances, occupancy, and attributes for both reconstruction and forecasting. On ERA5 dataset, GaussianCast achieves accurate weatehr reconstruction and skillful medium-range weather forecasting at substantially lower computational cost, and remains competitive on tropical cyclone tracks. To our knowledge, it is the first generative 3DGS NWP framework to place Gaussians on RGG and predict their parameters for reconstruction and forecasting.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel, computationally lightweight approach for medium-range forecasting based on applying 3D Gaussian Splatting. The approach safes an order of magnitude inference compute compared to models like GraphCast, and achieves reasonable performance scores.

### Strengths
The idea of 3D Gaussian Splatting is original, it leads to high computational efficiency while maintaining performance to a certain level. 

The work supports multi resolution out of the box.

The proposed method is sufficiently benchmarked within the weatherbench framework to get an initiation on strength and weaknesses.

### Weaknesses
The main claim of this work is to increase computational efficiency while maintaining performance. This should be investigated in more detail:
- AI emulators have demonstrated 10000x speed ups compared to NWP — this work shows 10x speed up over AI emulators — what does that mean? What can I do that I could not do before? Is it beneficial to accept the lowered accuracy for an enhanced computational efficiency?
- FLOPs are the only measurement used, why not wallclock time etc? At the moment, it’s hard to understand what the actual benefit of using this model really is besides that it’s grounded in a good idea and seems to require less FLOPs.


Overall, I don’t see significant contributions besides the speed ups which are not investigated in detail.

### Questions
How does a simple learned MLP mapping from RGG to lat-lon compare to the full 3DGS pipeline? This would justify the architectural complexity.


So-what question in my head is: Is it justified to assume a worse method that runs quicker will be used (keeping in mind that other emulators already speed up NWP by 10,000x)?

### Summary
This paper introduces GaussianCast, a novel framework for numerical weather prediction. It overcomes the data redundancy of traditional latitude-longitude grids by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a Reduced Gaussian Grid (RGG). A generative model, using multi-scale Graph Attention Transformers, is conditioned on the current atmospheric state to predict the parameters (covariance, features, opacity) of 3D Gaussians representing the future global atmospheric field.

### Strengths
This paper, "Breaking the Gridlock: Efficient Atmospheric Forecasting with 3D Gaussian Splatting on Reduced Gaussian Grids," presents several compelling strengths that make it a solid and valuable contribution.

1.  **Exceptional Clarity and Readability:** The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The narrative flows logically from the problem statement (redundancy in latitude-longitude grids) to the core insight (using 3DGS for continuous representation) and the solution (GaussianCast).
2.  **Rigorous and Exhaustive Analysis:** The experimental section is thorough and convincing. 
3.  **Impressive and Well-Demonstrated Model Efficiency:** This is arguably the paper's most significant contribution. The results on efficiency are not just claimed but are robustly supported by data. Achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models like GraphCast and Pangu-Weather while using **orders of magnitude less computational resources** (101M parameters vs. Billions, 1843 GFLOPs vs. ~20,000 GFLOPs) is a remarkable feat. The ability to generate a 10-day forecast in just 20 seconds on a single A100 GPU highlights its practical potential for operational settings with limited resources.

### Weaknesses
### **Major Points**

1.  **Novelty and Atmospheric Physics Integration:** The two core components of this work—3D Gaussian Splatting and Graph Attention mechanisms—are well-established techniques borrowed from other fields. A significant concern is the lack of demonstrable, novel design specifically tailored to the unique properties and physics of atmospheric data. This limits the novelty of the contribution.

2.  **Performance Scaling and SOTA Comparison:** The results in Table 1 show that the current model lags behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across all metrics. While the computational efficiency is commendable, it is crucial to provide a more detailed analysis of performance scaling. Specifically, if the model's parameters and computational budget were scaled up to the level of other SOTA models (e.g., ~10^4 GFLOPs), could its performance surpass theirs? Figure 7 partially addresses scaling with RGG points, but a direct comparison against other baselines under increased capacity is needed.

3.  **Ablation Study Completeness:** The model is primarily composed of the 3DGS representation and the GAT backbone. A critical ablation is missing: what is the performance if 3DGS is removed and the GAT is trained in a more conventional manner, with input and output operating directly on a uniform grid (or graph thereof), similar to models like GraphCast? This experiment is necessary to isolate the specific contribution of the 3DGS component to the overall performance.

4.  **Physical Consistency and Information Loss:** The use of a compressed, non-uniform grid representation (RGG) raises questions about potential loss of physical information. The authors should explicitly address this concern. For instance, a more convincing demonstration would be to interpolate both the compressed data and the original 721x1440 data to a common, higher-resolution uniform grid for comparison, ensuring that fine-scale physical structures are preserved.

5.  **Comparison with Contemporary Models:** The paper lacks comparisons with several recent and relevant atmospheric forecasting models, particularly CirT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19750) and OneForecast (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338). Given that the multi-scale attention and graph-based approach bears significant resemblance to models like OneForecast and GraphCast, their omission weakens the contextualization of this work within the current literature.

### **Minor Points**

6.  **Clarity on Grid Usage:** It should be clarified whether the "reduced Gaussian grid" used in this work is the same as or different from the grid used in GraphCast.

7.  **High-Resolution Inference Details (Section 4.5):** The process of training on 0.25° data and performing inference at 0.1° resolution is a key feature. However, the methodological details of how this is achieved are insufficiently explained and need elaboration.

8.  **Mathematical Typos:**
    *   Line 140: The expression for the Gaussian center coordinate `μ_i` seems to have a typographical error (likely a missing comma).
    *   Line 188: The dimensionality notation `p_i ∈ R^F` is inconsistent and should presumably be `p_i ∈ R^K` based on the defined frequency bands.

9.  **Appendix Figure Quality:** The image quality in the appendix is poor and should be replaced with high-resolution versions for clarity.

### Questions
1.  **Novelty & Physical Integration:** Beyond the application of existing techniques (3DGS, GAT), what is the specific *novel methodological contribution* of this work to atmospheric science? Could you clarify how the design explicitly incorporates and benefits from the unique properties of atmospheric physics, rather than being a direct transfer of models from other domains?

2.  **Performance Ceiling & Scaling:** The results indicate the model does not surpass SOTA performance despite high efficiency. What is the performance ceiling of your proposed architecture? If scaled up in parameters and computational budget (e.g., to ~10^4 GFLOPs), could it outperform models like GraphCast or FengWu? Please provide a scaling analysis or discussion on this point.

3.  **Ablation of Core Components:** To isolate the contribution of the 3DGS representation, what would be the performance of an ablated model that uses only the GAT backbone for direct prediction on a uniform grid (similar to GraphCast), keeping all other factors (number of parameters, training data) comparable?

4.  **Physical Fidelity & Grid Comparison:**
    *   Does the compression and representation on the Reduced Gaussian Grid lead to a loss of fine-scale physical information? Please provide a comparative analysis (e.g., by interpolating both your compressed data and the original data to a common high-resolution grid) to demonstrate the preservation of physical structures.
    *   How does your grid methodology specifically differ from that used in GraphCast?
    *   Furthermore, how does your method compare quantitatively with other recent graph-based models like OneForecast and CirT, which share conceptual similarities?

### Summary
GaussianCast proposes a novel framework based on generative 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for compact, continuous representation and efficient prediction of high-dimensional atmospheric data. The core of the model places 3DGS Gaussian centers on a Reduced Gaussian Grid (RGG) to achieve equal-area sampling and up to 14x data compression. Using a multi-scale Graph Attention Transformer (GAT), the model generates the Gaussian parameters (covariance, feature vectors, and opacity) for the next time step based on the current atmospheric state, enabling 6-hour interval global medium-range weather forecasting through differentiable rasterization. GaussianCast can generate a 10-day global forecast within 20 seconds, demonstrating the potential of 3DGS in data-driven medium-range weather prediction.

### Strengths
- **Methodological Innovation and Potential:** This work is the first to introduce generative 3DGS into the field of numerical weather prediction, combining it with RGG to address data redundancy in traditional latitude-longitude grids. This provides an efficient and promising new direction for continuous representation and prediction of high-dimensional atmospheric fields.
    
- **Technical Soundness:** The model design, particularly the integration of the RGG structure into 3DGS and the use of multi-scale GATs to handle irregular graph structures and capture global teleconnections, demonstrates solid technical implementation. The paper is well-structured and clearly presented.
    
- **Efficiency and Compression Advantages:** The model achieves up to 14x data compression and significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance, which is crucial for future scaling to higher-resolution weather forecasting.

### Weaknesses
- **Insufficient and Partial Presentation of Experimental Results:**
    
    - **Limited Variable Coverage:** While the model aims to predict 160 atmospheric variables, the core experiments (e.g., Table 1) primarily highlight forecasting performance for only four upper-air variables (Z500, T850, Q700, V850) and a few near-surface variables. A comprehensive evaluation and presentation of performance across the other hundred-plus variables (e.g., humidity, divergence at different pressure levels) are lacking, making the claimed "high-dimensional" advantage insufficiently validated.
        
    - **Limited Visualization:** Although GaussianCast is a global model, the forecast visualizations presented in the paper typically focus on local or regional results, which makes it difficult to fully demonstrate its predictive capability, smoothness, and coherence on a global scale.
        
- **Limited Research Significance and Performance Improvement:**
    
    - **Marginal Performance Gains:** From the surface variable forecasting performance shown in Table 1, GaussianCast does not clearly outperform several existing baseline models. Similarly, the tropical cyclone track prediction results in Figure 5 do not show decisive advantages.
        
    - **Limited Efficiency Advantage:** The claimed speed of generating a 10-day forecast in 20 seconds is not the fastest among current models. For example, FourCastNetV2 with similar resolution can also achieve a 10-day forecast in 20 seconds, and WeatherMesh-3 can complete a 14-day forecast within 10–12 seconds. Therefore, the model's primary contribution lies in methodological exploration rather than leading in absolute performance or speed.
        
- **Missing Experiments on Methodological Limitations:** Given that the main contribution of this work is the introduction of the 3DGS method, experiments addressing the inherent limitations of 3DGS should be supplemented, such as:
    
    - Lack of analysis on the model’s ability to handle unseen extreme weather events (generalization).
        
    - Lack of detailed evaluation on how 3DGS rendering at different sampling rates affects data smoothness or local detail preservation.

### Questions
1. Technical Correction Regarding Related Work: Please note that the statement in lines 098–099—“However, these models rely on latitude–longitude grids”—contains a technical inaccuracy. Recent AI forecasting models, such as AIFS (Lang, Simon, et al. "AIFS—ECMWF's data-driven forecasting system." arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.01465 (2024)), which is cited in your related work, already adopt the RGG. Therefore, this statement underestimates the progress made by the current field in addressing latitude-longitude grid redundancy and should be corrected to ensure accuracy.

2. Mechanistic Explanation of Conditional Generation and Generalization: In the introduction (lines 051–053), you correctly identify the inherent generalization weakness of traditional 3DGS (i.e., overfitting to individual samples). You propose that a generative framework conditioned on the "current atmospheric state" can overcome this issue, but a deeper explanation of this mechanism is lacking. Could you clarify: why does simply conditioning the current atmospheric state as input to the GAT effectively mitigate the generalization limitations inherent to 3DGS, which stem from its explicit point cloud representation? What is the theoretical basis behind this?
