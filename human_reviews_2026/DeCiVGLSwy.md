# Rex: Reversible Solvers for Diffusion Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 8, 4

## Abstract
Diffusion models have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications.
Encoding samples from the data distribution back into the models underlying prior distribution is an important task that arises in many downstream applications.
This task is often called the *inversion* of diffusion models.
Prior approaches for solving this task, however, are often simple heuristic solvers that come with several drawbacks in practice.
In this work, we propose a new family of solvers for diffusion models by exploiting the connection between this task and the broader study of *algebraically reversible* solvers for differential equations.
In particular, we construct a family of reversible solvers using an application of Lawson methods to construct exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the diffusion models.
We call this family of reversible exponential solvers *Rex*.
In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers we also demonstrate the utility of the methods through a variety of empirical illustrations.

### Summary
This paper addresses the important and challenging problem of creating algebraically reversible numerical solvers for diffusion models, which is crucial for tasks like data inversion, editing, and interpolation. The authors propose "Rex," a new family of solvers based on a novel combination of the McCallum-Foster (2024) reversible solver framework and exponential integrators (Lawson methods) tailored for diffusion models.

### Strengths
1. It proposes Rex-ODE, a reversible ODE solver that, by applying the McCallum-Foster method in a reparameterized space, inherits its non-trivial linear stability and high-order convergence properties —a clear advantage over prior work.

2. It introduces (to my knowledge) the first practical, algebraically reversible SDE solver (Rex-SDE) that does not require storing the entire $\mathcal{O}(N)$ Brownian motion path in memory. It cleverly achieves this using splittable PRNGs for noise reconstruction.

3. It provides a deep and valuable theoretical analysis (primarily in Appendix A) demonstrating that recent competing reversible solvers, namely BDIA and O-BELM, are fundamentally variants of the leapfrog/midpoint method and are thus nowhere linearly stable.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is deeply contradictory. The main derivation in Section 3.1 is for the "data prediction" parameterization. However, Appendix I (Figs 6, 8) explicitly shows this is pathologically unstable for inversion, with latent variances exploding to $\approx 10^7$. Appendix I and G.3 state that the "noise prediction" parameterization is stable and was used for key experiments. This makes it unclear what method was actually used for the main results in Tables 1 & 2 and invalidates the focus of the main paper's derivation.

2. A key selling point is the ability to achieve "arbitrarily high order of convergence". Yet, the empirical results in Tables 1, 2, and 4 consistently show that the high-order Rex (RK4) performs worse than its low-order counterparts (Rex-Euler, Rex-EM). The paper completely fails to discuss or analyze this significant negative finding.

3. For the standard unconditional sampling task (Table 1, FID), the Rex-ODE solvers are not SOTA. They are outperformed by the O-BELM baseline at 10 and 20 steps —the very baseline this paper proves is unstable. This suggests that for pure sampling (not inversion), the theoretical stability of Rex does not necessarily translate to superior FID.

4. What is the computational overhead (i.e., extra latency) of this "re-compute" strategy during the backward pass (inversion or gradient back-propagation) compared to the naive approach of simply storing the $\mathcal{O}(N)$ path? Is there a significant practical trade-off between memory and speed?

5. If an "unstable" method can achieve superior FID in a pure sampling task, why should the community adopt Rex-ODE for this purpose? Does this imply that the stability advantage of Rex is primarily relevant for inversion-dependent tasks (as asked in Q3) and offers no clear benefit for standard, forward-pass generation?

### Summary
This paper proposes a family of reversible SDE solvers named "Rex" based on the McCallum-Foster method, which can be reduced to reversible ODE  solvers by proper parameter-setup. To facilitate the derivation of Rex, the "change-of-variables" and Lawson method are utilised for reformulation of ODE and ODE solver. Experimental results on unconditional and conditional sampling are provided in the paper.

### Strengths
The paper proposes, for the first time, a family of reversible SDE solvers based on the McCallum-Foster method. Convergence analysis is conducted for Rex, showing the kth order convergence behavior. To facilitate exact inversion, random seeds for generating the Gaussian noises in the process of clean image to latent noises are stored in the memory. In the process from latent noise to clean image, the stored random seeds are utilized to recomputed the same Gaussian noises.

### Weaknesses
(1) The main weakness is that the proposed Rex performs worse than O-BELM in Table 1. The authors show in Theorem 4.1 that Rex has high-order convergence behavior. However, the experiments do not show its advantages.  If so, why would other researchers use Rex for sampling?    

(2) The experiments in the main paper only considers sampling and interpolation. I highly suggest the authors to evaluate Rex for round-trip image editing and compare with existing methods such as EDICT, BDIA, and O-BELM.  Note that reversible solvers are primarily used for image editing.  The authors state that both BDIA and O-BELM has poor stability.  Without the experiment on image editing, it is not clear at all if the proposed method provides any new benefits in terms of stability. 

(3) In the original BDIA paper, the authors also perform experiments over Stable Diffusion v1.5, and show that BDIA performs better than DDIM. Why in Table, does DDIM perform better than BDIA? I highly suspect if the optimal hyper-parameters were chosen for BDIA in this paper.

### Questions
(1) The authors states that "Following Wang et al. (2024) we choose the optimal hyperparameters for BDIA, EDICT, and BELM". The authors should state what the optimal hyper-parameters are for those methods. 

(2) Right before (2), I would think that alpha_t is monotonically decreasing over t and sigma_t is monotonically increasing over t. Correct me if I am wrong.

### Summary
This paper introduces REX, a family of algebraically reversible numerical solvers for diffusion models that enable exact inversion, mapping samples from the data distribution back to the prior distribution without reconstruction errors. The key innovation is applying Lawson methods combined with the McCallum-Foster reversible scheme to construct solvers that work for both the probability flow ODE and reverse-time SDE formulations of diffusion models.

### Strengths
The paper makes significant theoretical contributions by constructing the first known (to the best of my knowledge) method for exact SDE inversion without storing complete Brownian motion trajectories, which is a non-trivial achievement.

### Weaknesses
The only issue I see is the lack of concrete motivation for why exact inversion is important: the authors claim it is "invaluable for many downstream applications" but provide no citations or specific examples of these applications in the introduction or related work. This makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of the work beyond being a theoretically interesting problem.

### Questions
Can you provide specific examples with citations of downstream applications where exact inversion is crucial? What fails when using approximate inversion methods, and how does REX specifically enable these applications?

### Summary
This paper introduce REX, a unified family of algebraically-reversible ODE/SDE solvers for diffusion models. By applying Lawson methods to construct exponential Runge-Kutta methods, a family of reversible solvers has been developed to meet the needs of diffusion models. Empirical results on image generation and interpolation show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. This paper extends the McCallum-Foster framework to stochastic diffusions using exponential integrators and time reparameterization.
2. Rex provides a reversible solution for stochastic differential equations.
3. The Appendix is quite comprehensive, containing rich theoretical validations.

### Weaknesses
1. The current submission spends too much content to preliminary discussions (including Sections 3.1 and 3.2). The exact introduction of the REX solver does not begin until page 6, which restricts the space available for experiments that could demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods.
2. The current submission lacks experiments on image editing and reconstruction, which are commonly included in related literature.

### Questions
1. What are the advantages of REX compared to other related solvers? It is mentioned that one of the advantages of REX is its ability to perform exact inversion for diffusion SDEs without the need to store the entire trajectory. What are the exact costs of storing the entire trajectory?

2. As mentioned above, existing inversion works have made significant progress in applications such as image editing[1,2,3]. Would combining them with REX reduce the loss in inversion?

3. It would be better to provide results on more cutting-edge text-to-image models, e.g., SDXL, SD3 and Flux.
