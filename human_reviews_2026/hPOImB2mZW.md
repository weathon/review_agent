## Abstract
Autoformulation is an emerging field that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate natural-language descriptions of decision-making problems into formal mathematical formulations. Existing works have focused on autoformulating mathematical optimization problems for $\textit{one-shot}$ decision-making. However, many real-world decision-making problems are $\textit{sequential}$, best modeled as $\textit{Markov decision processes}$ (MDPs). MDPs introduce unique challenges for autoformulation, including a significantly larger formulation search space, and for computing and interpreting the optimal policy. In this work, we address these challenges in the context of queueing problems---central to domains such as healthcare and logistics---which often require substantial technical expertise to formulate correctly. We propose a novel operator-theoretic autoformulation framework using LLMs. Our approach captures the underlying decision structure of queueing problems through constructing the Bellman equation as a graph of $\textit{operators}$, where each operator is an $\textit{interpretable}$ transformation of the value function corresponding to certain $\textit{event}$ (e.g., arrival, departure, routing). Theoretically, we prove a universal three-level operator-graph topology covering a broad class of MDPs, significantly shrinking the formulation search space. Algorithmically, we propose customized Monte Carlo tree search to build operator graphs while incorporating self-evaluation, solver feedback, and intermediate syntax checking for early assessment, and present a provably low-complexity algorithm that automatically identifies structures of the optimal policy (e.g., threshold-based), accelerating downstream solving. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in formulating queueing problems and identifying structural results.

### Summary
A very interesting paper proposing an automated approach to translate and solve MDPs formulated as natural language descriptions within the domain of queueing theory. The approach uses LLMs to translate the natural language into an operator graph; the paper then provides theoretical and algorithmic results to operate on such graphs. The paper is complemented by a large set of tasks, itself a valuable resource.

### Strengths
While this is not my research field, it seems to me that the topic and approach are highly original. The paper has a nice combination of theoretical results (the introduction of the operator graph and Thm 4.1), algorithmic results (including complexity results on them, Thm 4.2), and implementation. The data set assembled consists of many tasks from realistic scenarios, and itself may constitute a valuable resource.

### Weaknesses
My understanding is that the theoretical/ algorithmic results are still predicated on the LLM being able to construct a correct graph, which is clearly not always the case. The paper is very dense, nevertheless the addition of "Take away" summaries enable also the reader with passing knowledge to get a grasp of the main innovation.

### Questions
I don't have particular questions at the moment, the paper was clear in its logical flow.

### Summary
The paper describes an approach to use LLMs to automatically formulate sequential decision problems as a class of MDPs. Of particular interest is the formulation of the solution of MDPs in terms of "operators" or transformations, and a dynamic programming approach to reason over the compositions of operators. When the MDP exhibits some structural properties such as monotonicity, the formulation is able to exploit it and solve the MDP efficiently. Besides the search space of different formulations is also made efficient by the operator theory approach. MCTS is used to search the space of formulations and is shown to be effective over 36 natural language descriptions of queuing problems of different complexities.

### Strengths
+ Autoformulation is an important understudied problem that bridges the gap between the LLMs and the classical AI such as optimization. The current work closes an important gap by bringing autoformualtion to the MDP literature. 
+ Automatically deriving the structural properties of the policies through the analysis of the operator composition is an important contribution. It makes the application of MDPs to real world problems much easier by non-experts.  
+ Empirical results show that Syntax Checks (SC) and Solver Feedback (SF) makes MCTS much more effective, out-competing state of the art methods such as Chain of Thought and targeted prompts.

### Weaknesses
- The appendix of the paper is too long (40+ pages) and unsuitable for conference reviewing. 

- On the other hand some parts of the appendix appear too important to be in the appendix, eg, the algorithms in F and the theorem in E. 
The authors should consider a better packaging of the paper, cut the appendix, and write a full-length journal paper that includes all details.

311. "brutal force" -> "bruteforce"
354. SF and SC are referred here for the first time, but defined only in 364. 
450. "untractable" -> "intractable"
479. "an universal" -> "a universal" ('u' is a vowel, but a/an distinction is based on how it sounds).

### Questions
The example in 313-317 sounds mysterious. You need an explanation of why A \bigcap B \bigcap C is the right answer right here and not in the appendix. In general it is not clear how \bigcap and \subset should be interpreted here and hence what B \bigcap C \subset E means. 

There seems to be an error in the Equations in page 25. The last step of Equation (58) has one \gamma. However, the next 3 transformations contain two \gammas (the first and the third) and composing them seems to yield \gamma^2. Can you clarify?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel operator-theoretic framework for the autoformulation of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) from natural-language descriptions, with a specific focus on queueing control problems (e.g., hospital ward management, call centers). Unlike existing works that use large language models (LLMs) to autoformulate one-shot optimization problems, this paper extends the idea to sequential decision-making, which involves greater complexity due to dynamic transitions, stochasticity, and implicit constraints.

### Strengths
1. Theoretical novelty: The paper makes a conceptually and mathematically novel contribution by connecting operator theory with automatic MDP formulation. It introduces an operator-graph representation of Bellman equations, and rigorously proves the existence of a universal three-level operator topology applicable to a broad class of event-based MDPs. This gives the autoformulation task a solid theoretical structure.

2. End to end framework: The proposed operator-graph framework is comprehensive and well-engineered. It integrates syntax checking, solver feedback, and self-rewarding search to achieve high formulation accuracy and interpretable policies. Empirical evaluation on queueing control problems demonstrates consistent and significant gains over baselines.

This paper presents a theoretically grounded and well-validated framework that advances the automation of sequential decision problem formulation, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.

### Weaknesses
This framework is evaluated only on queueing control problems, which, although well-chosen, represent a narrow subclass of event-driven MDPs. The paper does not demonstrate whether the proposed method generalizes to other sequential decision domains such as robotics, finance, or inventory control.

### Questions
Beyond queueing systems:  would be good to see the proposed operator-graph topology and autoformulation framework generalize to non-queueing domains.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to autoformulate MDPs for the control of queueing systems using LLMs and grounded on operator theory.
The core of the proposal is to construct the MDP's Bellman equation as a graph of operators, each operator transforming the value function corresponding to certain event. The paper develops a three-level operator-graph topology that covers a broad class of MDPs. The paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to build such operator graphs, and an algorithm that identifies structures of the optimal policy to accelerate the solution.

### Strengths
S1. Core structural result (Theorem 4.1) on the existence of a universal three-level operator-graph topology that represents a broad class of MDPs for queueing/control.

S2. Application of the operator graph to queueing-control MDPs and other examples, showing interpretability.

S3. Positioning within operator-learning trends for the sake of structured representation learning.

### Weaknesses
W1. The blanket claim that this the first work to represent Bellman equations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of operators is unsupportable. Prior work already treats Bellman-style equations/updates compositionally or on graphs. The paper asserts precedence for the general idea of viewing Bellman equations as DAGs (graphs) of operators. There is substantial prior literature that already represents Bellman-like computations compositionally, localizes Bellman updates to nodes in a graph/DAG, or studies Bellman operators and their compositions. Representative, explicit prior works:

Yu, Mahmood, Sutton: On Generalized Bellman Equations and Temporal-Difference Learning, ICML 2017. This paper develops generalized Bellman equations, explicitly treats different multi-step / trace-based operators and shows how value-function equations arise from composing/choosing among operators; the paper frames Bellman relations in operator terms. 

Gopalan et al.: Planning with Abstract Markov Decision Processes, ICAPS 2017. This work decomposes planning into a hierarchy (a DAG-like structure) of abstract subtasks and perform Bellman-style planning localized to nodes/levels. 

Jothimurugan et al.: Compositional Reinforcement Learning from Logical Specifications (DiRL), NeurIPS 2021. This work encodes specifications as abstract graphs and composes high-level planning with low-level RL; value/policy computations are decomposed across the graph structure.

W2. Lack of comparison against existing structured MDP representations (factored MDPs, hierarchical MDPs, AMDPs, object-oriented MDPs, modular RL). Experimental comparisons use ad hoc baselines rather than state-of-the-art methods with established theoretical or empirical guarantees.

W3. The scope of applicability (specific classes of queueing/control MDPs) is narrower than the broader claims sound. It is not demonstrated that the same reduction works well for more complex continuous-control MDPs or even on classical RL benchmarks (gridworlds, inventory control, navigation).

W4. The search procedure is described only at a high level and its computational complexity is not specified.

W5. It is unclear whether the chosen operator set (shift, clamp, increment, etc.) applies to other domains.

W6. The claim that the operator-graph topology reduces the MDP search space dramatically is not empirically validated.

### Questions
1. What is the complexity of the search procedure?
2. How do the chosen operators apply to other domains?
3. How much is the MDP search space reduced?
