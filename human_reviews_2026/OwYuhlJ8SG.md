## Abstract
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their "comfort zone," lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective alternatives.
To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints, and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its "comfort zone" and mitigate exploration stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper presents a new method that leverages the reasoning steps of much stronger LLMs to improve RLVR for 7-8B policies. By using different levels of hints to guide policies toward generating more accurate and diverse responses (including using teacher responses as a form of replay), the method achieves better performance on a range of reasoning benchmarks, such as AIME and GPQA.

### Strengths
+ The method is evaluated on both math benchmarks and other domains, such as science.
+ The method is well-motivated.
+ Experimental results on several benchmarks show the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
+ The diversity of the stronger response generators is a concern. Currently, three models are used for reasoning chain generation: DAPO-Qwen-32B, QWQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. The authors should consider using other sizes and models beyond the Qwen series.
+ Pass@k is used to show the method's exploration ability. However, the results are only shown on AIME 24/25, which contain only 60 instances. This is insufficient to demonstrate the exploration ability. Please add results on more of the evaluated datasets in this submission.
+ The budget for generating and filtering high-quality reasoning chains should be considered. Based on the description in Appendix D, this pre-processing step could be computationally expensive, but this cost is not discussed.
+ The paper should include a comparison of the proposed step partitioning method with simpler baselines, such as splitting by newlines (\n) or sentence segmentation. This is needed to justify the complexity of the proposed method.
+ The baseline comparisons are insufficient: (1) Please consider applying the hint-guided mechanism to the baseline models (e.g., GRPO) as an ablation. (2) For Dr. GRPO, results are only provided for Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, not the Math model. (3) Is the rollout budget the same for all methods? It seems the proposed method uses k_{hint} * (m-1) + k_{unhint} + 1 rollouts per prompt, while the baselines may have only used k_{unhint}, which would be an unfair comparison.

### Questions
+ Are hints used during inference time? If not, is there a train-test mismatch problem when evaluating with zero hints?
+ Data construction: How are the answers judged for correctness (e.g., rules, final answer only)? What percentage of the generated data was kept for training after filtering?
+ Backbone models: Is there a specific reason for selecting an Instruct version for the general-domain model but a base version for the math-specific model?
+ How is the quality of the step-level hints ensured? The current assumption seems to be that if the final answer is correct, all intermediate steps in the reasoning chain are also correct, which may not be true.

+ Reference error: The citation on line 267 (He et al., 2025) appears to point to DeepMath, but the context of the sentence (discussing GRPO) suggests it should be a different paper.

### Summary
This paper presents StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm designed to address the well-known "near-miss reward problem" and "exploration stagnation" in LLM reasoning tasks . The core idea is to use a stronger "teacher" model to generate valid reasoning chains, partition these chains into steps using a probabilistic method , and then feed these partial hints at multiple levels (i.e., different prefix lengths) to the "student" model during RL training . The method is well-motivated and demonstrates strong empirical performance, outperforming several baselines on math and generalization benchmarks. However, the core contribution appears more closely related to a sophisticated SFT curriculum or knowledge distillation than a fundamental enhancement of RL exploration. Key components, such as the adaptive partitioning, lack strong empirical justification over simpler baselines.

### Strengths
- The method is benchmarked against a wide array of strong baselines, including vanilla GRPO, SFT, and other RLVR-enhanced models (e.g., ORZ, Oat, LUFFY) . StepHint achieves state-of-the-art results across six in-domain math benchmarks. 
- The proposed solution is intuitive and directly targets LLM reasoning issues: providing partial expert hints (the 'hints') reduces the search space to mitigate near-misses, while exposing the model to high-quality reasoning paths (the 'multi-level' expert trajectories) aim to overcome stagnation.

### Weaknesses
- The paper's central weakness is its framing. The method, which relies on generating expert trajectories and forcing the model to imitate them (either partially or fully via the reference trajectory), appears to be a sophisticated form of curriculum-based SFT or knowledge distillation rather than a novel RL exploration algorithm.
- A core technical contribution, the probabilistic partitioning heuristic ($p(</think>|G_i) > p(</think>|G_{i+1})$) in Sec 3.2.1, is not sufficiently justified 18. The paper's own ablation study (Appendix G.2) compares the 'Base' and 'Salient' strategies and finds they have comparable overall performance. This finding directly undermines the novelty, suggesting the specific heuristic for identifying 'salient' boundaries is unnecessary. Moreover, the paper fails to compare this complex probabilistic method against simple, non-probabilistic baselines (e.g., splitting by sentence boundaries, or splitting into $m=4$ equal token chunks). Without this, the complexity of the proposed method is not justified.
- The 'multi-level' hint strategy (Sec 3.2.2) is not an adaptive curriculum. This design is computationally expensive, as it generates $k_{hint}(m-1)+k_{unhint}+1$ completions for every training problem (12 completions in the paper's setting, based on $m=4$, $k_{hint}=2$, $k_{unhint}=5$) 21. This is a significant overhead. The paper provides no ablation to justify this costly 'all-prefixes' approach over simpler, more efficient sampling strategies, such as sampling only one random hint level $j \in \{1, ..., m-1\}$ per problem.

### Questions
- Could the authors clarify the conceptual distinction between StepHint and a carefully-designed SFT/distillation curriculum that mixes full trajectories with prefix-based completions? What evidence demonstrates that the model is learning an exploratory RL policy rather than simply imitating expert prefixes?
- Given the findings in Table 4 (Appendix G.2) that the 'Salient' partitioning strategy offers no benefit over 'Base' random sampling, can the authors justify the necessity of this probabilistic heuristic? Have the authors compared this method to simpler, non-probabilistic baselines like splitting by sentence boundaries?
- Regarding the 'multi-level' design (Sec 3.2.2), could the authors provide an ablation study comparing the current brute-force approach (training on all $m-1$ hint prefixes) against a more efficient strategy, such as randomly sampling a single hint level per training instance? This would clarify if the significant computational overhead is necessary for the method's success.
- For the training dynamics in Figure 4, how can the authors decouple the high entropy from the high-variance input data (a mix of no-hint, partial-hint, and full-reference data)? Is it not expected that a policy trained on such a diverse set of SFT-like targets would exhibit higher entropy, independent of any learned "exploration" behavior?

### Summary
The paper identifies two concrete issues in RLVR and provides a structured solution that is easy to follow. The multi-level hint framework conceptually bridges imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

### Strengths
The paper identifies two concrete issues in RLVR and provides a structured solution that is easy to follow. The multi-level hint framework conceptually bridges imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

### Weaknesses
1. The main idea of progressively providing structured hints or intermediate supervision is conceptually similar to **BREAD[1] and curriculum learning algorithms.** The paper fails to discuss how StepHint differs from or improves upon those approaches, which significantly weakens the **novelty claim**.
2. The use of the *probability of generating `</think>`* as the signal for partitioning reasoning steps is somewhat ad hoc. The intuition is weakly justified, and the paper lacks qualitative evidence and ablation studies confirming that such partitions align with meaningful reasoning steps.
3. The comparison with **LUFFY**, which also uses *reference trajectories*, is methodologically problematic. The authors use pre-trained LUFFY models (off-the-shelf), while other baselines like GRPO and SFT are retrained from scratch. This inconsistency may introduce **dataset and training differences**, making the comparison unfair.

### Summary
This work aims to improve models for mathematical reasoning through two main contributions. First, they propose a simple method for partitioning partitioning reasoning traces into discrete steps. These steps are used in StepHint, their RLVR algorithm. In training, the model can use the discrete steps to know when an incorrect solution is *partially correct*, and it can adjust the advantage during GRPO. The authors claim this addresses the "near-miss reward" issue. Finally, the partially correct trajectories can be used as "hints" to enable mixed training of later parts of the reasoning chain, resulting in greater exploration during training. The authors show that StepHint results in a stronger model both in-domain and out-of-domain (non-math) than other comparative mathematical benchmarks, and demonstrate that these improvements are due to both the adjusted GRPO to address the "near-miss reward problem" and the extra exploration to address "exploration stagnation."

### Strengths
* Elegant method for determining/discretizing natural language reasoning chains into discrete logical steps with the probability of </think> token.
* Broad study of the space given these logical steps, e.g. study with partial advantage and training with partial (hinted) trajectories to showcase potential applications of the discretization effort.
* Effective in-domain and OOD performance on mathematical and other reasoning datasets for 7B-sized models.

### Weaknesses
* The new GRPO advantage still relies on exact token match for partial rewards, which is a limitation. One way around this, for example, would be to have a separate judge/verifier decide whether two steps are logically equivalent. Otherwise, I don't think this fully solves the near-miss issue, rather it feels more like a "first step" or a bandage over it.
* One of the core contributions is that the automated method for step detection is "good." Besides the limitation that it still relies on hyperparameters (l, m) selected by the experimenters, it should be compared against other methods for detecting boundaries like using baseline heuristics (sentence boundaries) or the aforementioned syntactic cues (L206). And/or on a dataset where the gold step boundaries are labeled. There is a start of this in G.2. but not against the baseline heuristics.

### Questions
* In practice, what do the step boundaries actually look like? S_2 in Figure 2 is not what I would have expected. In other words, are the step boundaries human-interpretable?
* The intuition around entropy makes sense to me, but the conclusion in L455 is not convincing -- wouldn't we want to measure entropy at reasoning step k rather than entropy at training step k? The latter is an approximation but the direct claim relates to the former.
* The response length graph also confuses me -- as it almost suggests that the GRPO model is undertrained or not trained correctly. If the reference responses are long (like they are in StepHint), is GRPO simply unable to learn to also make long responses? I feel like I've seen this observation before though but don't remember where from. If it is a known finding, it would be nice to have a citation to something else that has a similar finding.
* How does StepHint relate to other non-LLM RL problems (around trajectory planning, or discrete actions in robots/games)? It feels like there should be a connection there, both for the analogy with entropy and concretely in the algorithm (e.g. reward assignment and starting with partial trajectories). 
* Appendix A mentions that LLMs are used to generate high-quality reasoning chains and partition the chains into logical steps. When is this done? This is not mentioned in Appendix E, and the methods in the main body do not mention an LLM in the loop anywhere.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for distilling a stronger reasoning model into the RL training loop of a weaker model by initializing the weaker model's prompts with hints from the stronger model. The authors propose two steps to do this: first by splitting reasoning traces into hint based on the probability of generating an end think tag and second by providing multi-level hints for all problems. The authors also prove that autoregresssive prediction reduces conditional entropy. The main empirical results show their method performs better in-domain and out-of-domain over baselines.

### Strengths
1. The clarity and presentation of the paper is quite clear. The paper makes for an easy read, and the core set of contributions are clearly explained and motivated which I appreciated.
2. The core set of results in Table 1 cover both in-domain and out-of-domain performance which is a nice addition. This improves the empirical significance of the results.
3. The idea of prepending hints from existing reasoning trajectories is well-executed and the authors justify the construction of hints well based on entropy.

### Weaknesses
1. I have various questions about the experimental setup, see the questions section for details. I'm willing to raises my score if these questions are addressed. Right now, I view the clarity of the empirical experiments as a weakness.
2. In addition, I have concerns on the significance of the empirical results. I'd like to see a more thorough comparison with baselines that are equally privileged (access to teacher reasoning chains and can RL). See the questions sections for specifics.
3. I'm a bit concerned by the brevity of the related works section. RL algorithms for improving language model reasoning have been abundant over the past year, so I'm concerned the current section doesn't contextualize related work properly, making it difficult to judge novelty. I'd be interested in seeing it expanded with more references to current papers that focus on learning from a stronger model (sequence-level and logit-level distillation, on-policy distillation) as well as other reasoning papers that introduce hints or a curriculum over problem difficulty.

### Questions
1. In Table 1, what are the performances of the starting backbone models? I'm wondering how much improvement the various baselines and StepHint provide over the initialization. 
2. Similarly, the appendix states that the reasoning chains are distilled from DAPO-Qwen-32B, QWQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. What are the performances of the teachers and how close does StepHint get to this upper bound? 
3. For figure 3, if you extended the x-axis beyond k =128 (such as done in https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837), do the gains of the base model match StepHint? 
4. For the comparison in Table 2 using Llama, isn't GRPO a relatively weak baseline as it doesn't get to leverage the teacher reasoning traces at all? Also I'm a bit confused about the benchmark results for GRPO. Llama 3 8B gets 20% on MATH based on the original Llama 3 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783). Why does GRPO only get 9% on MATH500 in your setting? Can you also include the results of the initial model in your setting so we know how much improvement there is. 
5. Would StepHint provide a benefit over vanilla RL if the teacher hints were from the starting model and filtered for correct traces?
6. For Table 1, are all of the rows re-implemented from scratch or are the models just evaluated in the same setting? 
7. For Table 1, the only methods that get access to the reasoning traces are LUFFY and StepHint? Generally, I'm interested in seeing the performance of stronger distillation baselines, even an offline logit-based loss, possibly mixed in during RL. I don't think it's very meaningful if a method with extra supervision and the ability to do RL outperforms a baseline only with the ability to do RL.
8. For the last sentence in the caption of Figure 2, how does RL for learning from the reference trajectory work? Is the model prompted with the problem and a full solution and still asked to solve? Or is there a different instantiation?
