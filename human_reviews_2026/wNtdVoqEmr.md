# Neural Force Field: Few-shot Learning of Generalized Physical Reasoning

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Physical reasoning is a remarkable human ability that enables rapid learning and generalization from limited experience. Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation ( ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields. Experiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.

### Summary
This paper presents a method for learning physical systems behavior and dynamics by combining an explicit ODE solver working on top of a learned, implicit, force field. The force field is learned as a mapping between a pairs of objects states (position, velocity etc.) in the scene (given the scene graph which denotes which objects interact with which) and the scene space. The training signal comes through prediction error using ground truth trajectories and back-proping through the ODE solver into the neural networks which govern the implied force field.

The method is shown to work nicely on a variety of tasks and an ablation analysis is performed to investigate the effect of different components in the model. Furthermore the model is shown to be useful for physical based reasoning. It is demonstrated that the method is able to learn from significantly

### Strengths
Generally speaking I found the paper interesting, well motivated, well executed and enjoyable to read.

* The main contribution of the paper - a combination of an explicit inductive bias in the form of an ODE solver with an implicitly learned force field plays well to the strength of neural networks from one side, and the strength of explicit knowledge on the other side.
* I think this is the first paper I see this specific combination being used.
* The paper is clearly written and enjoyable to read. It is well structured, and well organized. Figures mostly help in understanding and the accompanying video is helpful.
* Experimental validation is satisfactory - covering several tasks, several baselines and ample ablation. Results are convincing, especially on the data efficiency side where one would expect this model to excel at (due to the strong inductive biases).
* While not ground breaking (see below) I think there is a valid contribution to the community here.

### Weaknesses
There are several issues, I think, with the paper, some addressable at this time-frame, some probably less so - but none, I think, are critical.

* I think it would be good to show more explicitly how the mapping between the force field acting on each object and scene space - essentially, write down explicitly how to produce the force fields visible in Figure 3. In other words - how is the force field parameterized exactly in terms of coordinates? or in other words, what is d-force and how does it relate to space?

* While there is a nice set of experiments in the paper - they all involve rigid object dynamics. I am wondering if it is possible to apply this method to non-rigid dynamics data - i.e, fluid dynamics, weather systems etc. This would be very compelling.

* On a similar note - all the experiments here assume known ground truth states (either provided explictly, or inferred from masked images). How senstitive is the method to errors in that provided state? Is there a way to learn a mapping, for example, from images to state, by utilizing these inductive biases, or would the system collapse due to inaccuracies?

Given clarifications to the above I will consider raising my score after rebuttal as I like the paper!

### Summary
This paper proposes a pipeline, Neural Force Field (NFF), for predicting force fields using neural networks—as opposed to directly predicting velocities or state changes. From what I understand, the main motivation is to exploit ODE integration methods by learning to predict force fields. This allows for continuous integration at arbitrary resolutions. Experiments on three different datasets show the advantage of using NFFs.

### Strengths
The paper is written clearly and quite well-organized. The motivation behind most of the design decisions are explained clearly. Experiments are designed in a way to directly test the claims. Overall, I enjoyed the paper and I think it might draw some attention.

### Weaknesses
I didn’t follow the reasoning after Eq. 2. If we do not take mass into account, how can we predict the velocity accurately in general? It’s mentioned that mass is absorbed in force through correlated features like size, but is there any experiment that tests this assertion with counterintuitive sizes? Or, to put it in another term, how do the results change with objects of highly varying densities? Do you think adding a mass prediction would help? This part needs to be discussed and motivated in more detail.

I’m not sure if this is due to the space constraints but, Figures 1 and 2 (especially Fig. 2) are a bit condensed and hard to parse.

I'm not fully familiar with the work in this subfield, but it doesn't strike me as something brand new to do force prediction and combine it with ODE integration. Most of the related work is mentioned as it lacks robustness and sample efficiency, which makes it feel like the main contribution is the few-shot performance rather than the force + ODE combination. If that is the case, then I would wonder what's different in this method that makes it more sample efficient and applicable in few-shot scenarios---I don't think it's clear from the related work section. I tried to search for other methods, and found some, but I couldn't be sure if they are working with the same set of assumptions, and therefore, didn't want to speculate. So, I am relying on my fellow reviewers on this point, and might change my score if they think this is very close to some other work.

### Questions
Please also consider my concern in the weaknesses section.

Apart from that, I’m not sure whether training the model with new data should be called interactive reasoning. Could you provide some details on the model update? How many optimization steps are done in each round in Figure 6?

All of the compared methods are doing pixel reconstructions as far as I can tell. While the results support that predicting force fields is a better alternative when compared with pixel reconstruction, I’m not sure if it compares the model itself (i.e., the force field + ODE integration) with, say, SlotFormer, since the predictions are in different lands. I wonder how SlotFormer would perform if it’s at least predicting positions (if not forces). Or is it the case for only PHYRE tasks?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new representation of scene dynamics using neural force fields. The model takes the state of the system as input, represented using position and velocity observations for various objects in the scene as an interaction graph, and produces an estimate of the forces that are operating in the scene. These force estimates can then be used to solve an ODE that would produce future states (object positions and velocities) of the world, conditioned on past observations. 

The authors show that this framework enables both prediction and planning tasks with strong performance on multiple synthetic datasets.  The model also is capable of generalizing from much fewer observations compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths
1. The methods introduced in this paper are important advances. The force field representation provides clear advantages over the standard interaction network based architectures which are based on latent space transitions. By modeling physical transitions through forces, NFF provides better physical grounding to enable generalization from a lesser number of observations.
2. Neural force fields enable multiple tasks to be performed under the same underlying framework. The authors report strong results on future prediction, forward and backward planning on multiple synthetic datasets like I-Phyre, Phyre and N-body.
3. Experiments in this paper are extensive. Different aspects of the framework such as grounding the ODE and cross scenario generalization are rigorously tested.

### Weaknesses
The paper is easy to follow overall, but I found that some aspects of the method are not very clear. 
 
1. The formulation requires the past history of the object states as input in order to predict forces, but it seems like eqn (1) only contains the current state of the world as input. In theory this would not work, unless you make the assumption that acceleration is not required for estimating forces, which seems incorrect. Later in L194, it’s said that the framework uses autoregressive prediction of future states given past states - it seems like this is inconsistent with eqn (1) somehow.   
2. I’m wondering how object geometry gets modeled in this framework, because that doesn’t seem to be part of the description of the system state which includes only position and velocity. Isn’t that necessary to predict forces that result from collisions? It seems like there’s some underlying assumptions being made which is not evident when you read the paper.
3. I think another assumption being made is that all collisions are elastic and objects are rigid. To generalize this, we would need a representation of the material properties of objects, which the authors do not discuss. Moreover, it seems like the mass of the object is not part of the state in eqn (1). It might be worth first talking about a more generic physical system which doesn’t have these assumptions, and then introduce the approximations being made. Otherwise it seems like the equations are physically incorrect. 
4. The authors talk about an image space NFF, but don’t describe how the state of the system is represented in this case. Do they use an off the shelf model to get object masks/positions, or use pre-trained features as state representation? This part was not clear to me. 

The goals laid out in the intro are too broad and ambitious. The paper doesn’t really solve them, which is okay, but the limitations and the way forward should still be discussed (i.e. how might one extend this to real stimuli). Otherwise, it’s hard to understand the contributions of the paper and makes the intro a bit misleading. In fact, the conclusions seem to talk about other domains like migration patterns, etc. which I think is not useful in the light of physical reasoning goals setup in the intro.

### Questions
My main questions are about the details of the method, and the assumptions being made on each task introduced in the results section (see point 1-4 in weakness).

I’m also curious to know what the authors think about extending this method to real stimuli and what roadblocks one might face.

### Summary
The paper aims to better model and learn the physical interactions, and proposes to use a neural operator to learn the force field from external interventions and object interactions. 

The force field is parameterized by a graph neural network. An ODE integrator (such as the Euler integrator) is applied to generate object trajectories from the force field represented by the neural network. To train the model, the network is optimized by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between predictions and ground truth.

The method is evaluated by several benchmarks: I-PHYRE, a suite of complex physical reasoning puzzles;  N-body problem for trajectory prediction; and PHYRE, a vision-based benchmark of physical reasoning puzzles. Several methods are used to compare against the proposed method: vanilla IN, SEGNO, and SlotFormer. From the experiment results, the proposed method generates trajectories that closely match ground truth behavior, and shows good generalization to new scenario. The trained NFF model also shows the ability to generate plans for new tasks after learning from limited examples.

### Strengths
* It appears novel (to me) to learn the force field using a neural operator instead of directly learning physical interactions or trajectories.

* Besides comparing experiments with the ground-truth trajectories, the paper also demonstrates the learned force field, as well as testing it with planning tasks.

* Additionally, the paper provides a clear video to demonstrate the experiment results.

### Weaknesses
I just have some additional questions listed in the section below.

### Questions
* The paper uses graph based model as the backbone network to model  the force field, would it suffer the issue that hard to model long-distance interactions among multiple objects? 


* In traditional physical simulations, force-based method usually needs small time steps to make it stable. Does the same apply to this paper’s force-based method? (Does the model needs a smaller dt to maintain stability, or just need the similar dt as the other compared methods?)


* For the training trajectory that contains multiple time step, is the MSE loss is computed on each time step's predication or only on the final state of the trajectory?


* For the rigid body collision problems tested in the paper, it might be more convincing to also demonstrate such cases in 3D scenes (if an appropriate dataset is available). Most of the examples (excepts for the N-body problem) presented in the paper are 2D cases.
