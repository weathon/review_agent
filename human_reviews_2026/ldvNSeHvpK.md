# Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) as Foundational Recommenders: A Multi-Domain, Multi-Dataset Benchmark

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 2, 4, 2

## Abstract
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have raised the question of whether these models can serve as foundational recommenders across diverse domains. To systematically investigate this potential, we introduce RecBench-MD, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing the recommendation capabilities of LLMs from a multi-domain and multi-dataset perspective. Our benchmark encompasses 15 datasets spanning 10 domains, including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media, and evaluates 21 state-of-the-art LLMs under zero-resource, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that (i) in-domain fine-tuning consistently delivers the strongest performance, (ii) cross-dataset transfer provides practical benefits in emerging recommendation contexts, and (iii) multi-domain training enhances the adaptability of LLM-based recommenders. These findings highlight both the opportunities and limitations of positioning LLMs as foundational recommenders. To support future research, we will publicly release all code and data.

### Summary
This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs), once trained on recommendation tasks, can generalize across different domains. To enable systematic evaluation, the authors propose RECBENCH-MD, a comprehensive multi-domain benchmark that integrates existing datasets from various recommendation domains. Using this benchmark, they assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs under zero-shot, fine-tuning, and cross-domain transfer settings. The results demonstrate that in-domain fine-tuning yields the best performance, while cross-domain transfer provides practical benefits in new recommendation contexts.

### Weaknesses
S1: **Scope**: This paper focuses on evaluating the transferability of large language models (LLMs) as foundational recommenders across domains. It is a promising research direction in the recommendation field: How to leverage different domain's dataset for better recommend and scaling.

S2: **Experimental Rigor**: The study conducts comprehensive experiments involving 21 LLMs with diverse architectures and model scales, evaluated under various dataset combinations and learning settings (zero-shot, fine-tuning, and transfer). Such extensive empirical analysis provides insights into the generalization capabilities of LLM-based recommenders.

### Questions
**W1. Insufficient dataset construction details**: The paper provides limited information on how the training and evaluation subsets were constructed from each dataset. It is unclear how sampling was performed or whether consistent preprocessing protocols were applied across domains. Moreover, many datasets appear to contain only title-level textual features, which may constrain the LLM’s ability to model item semantics and contextual relevance effectively.

**W2. Limited training methodologys  for generalization evaluation.**
Although the paper assess the generalization ability of LLMs in various recommendation tasks, the evaluation setup mainly relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or embedding similarity-based matching. This setup does not capture the full potential of LLM adaptation. As prior work has shown [1, 2, 3], reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in aligning model outputs with recommendation objectives, and its absence weakens the validity of the generalization claims.

**W3. Narrow evaluation of embedding quality.**
The evaluation of embedding-based recommenders is confined to direct use in a dual-tower retrieval structure. However, the quality of embeddings can manifest in multiple downstream ways. For example, LLM2Rec [4] demonstrates that LLM-derived embeddings used for item embedding initialization can enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization when coupled with collaborative-filtering (CF) signals. A broader analysis of embedding quality would have made the findings more robust.

**W4:Lack of deeper analytical insights.**
The experimental analysis mainly reports performance changes across datasets and training settings, without providing sufficient interpretation of the underlying causes. For instance, the authors note that single-domain cross-dataset fine-tuning is not always more effective than cross-domain fine-tuning and attribute this to “similar data distributions,” yet no empirical evidence is offered to support this claim. Similarly, while LLMs trained on PENS datasets consistently perform better on others (Table 4), no further analysis is provided—e.g., regarding user–item matrix sparsity or domain similarity metrics—which could have explained these phenomena more convincingly.

### Summary
This paper introduces RECBENCH-MD, a large-scale multi-domain, multi-dataset benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on recommendation tasks.
It unifies 15 datasets across 10 domains and defines eight evaluation setups covering zero-shot, in-domain, cross-dataset, and cross-domain fine-tuning.
The authors evaluate 21 backbone models (e.g., BERT, OPT, LLaMA, Qwen, GLM, GPT-3.5, E5, RecFormer) under both prompt-based and embedding-based paradigms, and propose a new metric, RRA (Reciprocal Rank Average), to quantify dataset transferability.
Experiments show that in-domain fine-tuning generally performs best, multi-domain pretraining improves generalization, and RRA better reflects robust cross-dataset benefits.

### Strengths
1.	Comprehensive coverage — The benchmark spans 10 domains and 15 datasets, providing rare breadth in LLM-for-Rec evaluation.
2.	Practical findings — Demonstrates how larger models benefit from multi-domain fine-tuning and identifies strong transferable datasets.

### Weaknesses
1.	Lack of comparison with existing LLM-based recommendation methods.
The paper only compares different LLM backbones under a fixed fine-tuning setup, without including representative LLM-based recommendation frameworks (e.g., RecGPT[1], TALLRec[2], RankGPT[3], RecFormer[4], MoLoRec[5], One-Model-for-All[6]).
As a benchmark paper, it is insufficient to evaluate only model families (BERT vs. LLaMA vs. Qwen); it must also evaluate methodological paradigms—prompt-engineering, reasoning-based, retrieval-augmented, adapter-based, or generation-based methods.
Without such baselines, the benchmark cannot convincingly guide practitioners or measure real progress in LLM-for-Rec.
2.	No analysis of different fine-tuning strategies.
The authors fix LoRA fine-tuning for all models. Yet, diverse tuning strategies (full-finetune, prefix-tuning, adapter, instruction-tuning, multi-step sequential tuning, in-context learning) often lead to dramatically different behaviors in recommendation tasks.
A benchmark aiming to be “foundational” should at least include ablations or comparative studies across these tuning paradigms to understand their trade-offs in accuracy vs. efficiency.
3.	Insufficient discussion on textual vs. non-textual datasets.
Many datasets in RECBENCH-MD differ substantially in text richness—e.g., news and books datasets contain rich natural language, while user–item logs (e.g., Amazon Electronics, Yelp) are structured or sparse.
Since LLMs rely on textual semantics, performance gaps across such dataset types are expected to be significant, yet the paper lacks a dedicated analysis or normalization.
Without explicitly separating “text-dominant” vs. “non-textual” domains, it is difficult to interpret whether the performance differences stem from model architecture or simply from text availability.

### Summary
This paper presents RECBENCH-MD, a large-scale, multi-domain, and multi-dataset benchmark designed to systematically assess large language models (LLMs) as foundational recommenders. The benchmark includes 15 datasets from 10 domains and evaluates 21 state-of-the-art LLMs under various scenarios—zero-shot, fine-tuning, and cross-domain transfer. Eight comprehensive experimental settings (A–H) are defined to cover single- and multi-domain, single- and multi-dataset cases. The authors report several key findings: in-domain fine-tuning yields the best results; cross-dataset transfer offers practical benefits in new recommendation contexts; and multi-domain training improves model adaptability. The paper provides extensive experimental analyses, open-source data, and code to facilitate reproducibility.

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive and systematic benchmark design: RECBENCH-MD is arguably the most extensive benchmark to date for evaluating LLM-based recommenders, covering a diverse range of datasets, domains, and models.
2. Clear and well-structured experimental taxonomy: The eight well-defined evaluation settings (A–H) provide a clear taxonomy for understanding the effects of domain, dataset, and fine-tuning regime, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners.
3. High reproducibility and transparency: The authors provide detailed experimental configurations, including LoRA fine-tuning settings and dataset statistics, and commit to releasing code and checkpoints publicly, which enhances reproducibility and research value.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited methodological novelty: The main contribution lies in benchmark construction and empirical evaluation rather than introducing a new algorithm or theoretical insight. This makes the work primarily engineering-oriented rather than conceptual.
2. Lack of traditional baselines: The comparison focuses on LLMs and a single LLM-based recommender baseline (RecBase), but omits traditional recommendation models (e.g., SASRec, GRU4Rec, BERT4Rec) that could contextualize LLM performance, especially since LLMs may not outperform collaborative models in all scenarios.
3. Efficiency and cost analysis is superficial: The paper briefly mentions that LLMs are inefficient in fine-tuning and inference but does not provide quantitative comparisons (e.g., GPU hours, FLOPs, or memory cost) or discuss trade-offs with smaller adapters or quantization techniques.
4. Limited task coverage: The benchmark currently excludes sequential recommendation, a core task in the field. Since the authors already handle user-item interaction sequences, extending to sequential prediction should be feasible and meaningful.
5. Information leakage concern: All datasets used are public, and many LLMs were trained on web-scale corpora that could overlap with these sources (e.g., Amazon, Yelp, Goodreads). The paper does not discuss how potential data contamination or training leakage was mitigated or verified.
6. Incomplete fine-tuning exploration: The study only applies LoRA-based parameter-efficient tuning, without examining whether full fine-tuning could yield substantially different conclusions. This omission may limit the validity of claims about LLMs’ adaptation capabilities.
7. Limited analysis depth: While the experimental coverage is broad, much of the discussion remains observational (e.g., “larger models generalize better”) without deeper causal or representational analysis—for instance, quantifying domain similarity or understanding feature-level transfer.
8. Metric and statistical reporting: Although the authors state that results are averaged over five runs with significance testing (p < 0.05), no variance or confidence intervals are reported, making it difficult to assess robustness.
9. Choice of similarity metric (Equation 3): The embedding-based recommendation model uses cosine similarity, but the rationale is unclear. It would be valuable to see whether dot-product or L2 distance were tested and how sensitive results are to this choice.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the potential of large language models (LLMs) as foundational recommenders. To address the limitations of "single-dataset/single-domain" and fragmented conclusions in current LLM-based recommendation research, it proposes RECBENCH-MD, the first multi-domain, multi-dataset benchmark. Covering 15 datasets across 10 domains (e.g., e-commerce, entertainment, social media), the benchmark systematically evaluates the recommendation capabilities of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs under zero-resource, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning scenarios. By comparing prompt-based recommendation and embedding-based matching—the study reveals key patterns of LLMs in recommendation tasks (e.g., in-domain fine-tuning yields the best performance, cross-dataset transfer has practical value) and open-sources code and data to support future research.

### Strengths
## 1. Innovation and Comprehensiveness of the Benchmark: 
Fills the gap in "multi-domain, multi-dataset evaluation of LLM recommendation capabilities". The 8 scenario designs cover the full range from basic zero-shot to complex multi-domain transfer, far exceeding existing benchmarks (e.g., LLMRec only supports single-domain single-paradigm), providing a unified evaluation standard for the field.

## 2. Practical Value and Openness: 
Open-sourced resources lower the threshold for subsequent research.

### Weaknesses
## 1. Limited Scenario Coverage
The paper only evaluates two recommendation tasks (prompt-based ranking and embedding-based matching) but omits sequential recommendation—a core scenario in real-world systems (e.g., predicting the next item a user will interact with). This limits the benchmark’s applicability to dynamic user behavior modeling.

## 2. Neglect of LLM-Based Generative Recommendation. 
The paper completely overlooks LLM-based generative recommendation—a key direction in recent research that includes text-driven generative recommendation (e.g., generating personalized item descriptions or recommendation reasons) and SID (Semantic Identifier)-based generative recommendation (represented by OneRec). By focusing solely on discriminative tasks (prompt-based ranking, embedding-based matching), the benchmark fails to capture the unique value of LLMs in generating interpretable, personalized recommendation outputs. This omission limits the benchmark’s relevance to emerging generative recommendation scenarios.

## 3. Overemphasis on Raw LLM Performance While Underplaying Practical Improvements.
The paper devotes extensive discussion to the recommendation performance of raw LLMs (e.g., zero-shot or basic fine-tuning), despite the community’s general consensus that raw LLMs perform poorly in recommendation tasks. More critically, it provides minimal analysis of practical strategies to improve LLM performance for recommendation—such as hybrid models (combining LLMs with traditional recommenders), specialized pre-training for recommendation (e.g., incorporating user-item interaction signals), lightweight adaptation (beyond LoRA), or recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. This gap makes the research less actionable for addressing the "poor raw performance" issue.

### Questions
## 1. Integrate Generative Recommendation to Expand Benchmark Coverage.
To make RECBENCH-MD a truly comprehensive benchmark for LLM-based recommendation, we suggest adding generative recommendation tasks with clear standardization:(1) Task Definition: Include two typical generative tasks—"next-item title generation" (predicting next items via text) and "next-item SID generation" (predicting next items via SIDs).

This addition will enable the benchmark to capture LLMs’ unique generative advantages, which discriminative tasks alone cannot reflect.

## 2. Add a "Practical Improvement Track" for LLM Recommendation.
To address the gap between raw LLM performance and real-world needs, we recommend adding a dedicated track in RECBENCH-MD for improved LLM-based recommendation methods. This track will make the benchmark more actionable, as it directly addresses the "how to make LLMs work better for recommendation" question faced by researchers and engineers.

## 3. Considerations for Excluding Generative Recommendation Tasks.
As a multi-domain benchmark aiming to assess LLMs as "foundational recommenders," generative recommendation (e.g., SID-based generation in OneRec) has become a core capability of LLMs in recommendation. Could you elaborate on:(1) The specific reasons for excluding generative tasks in the current version?(2) Whether there is a roadmap to integrate generative tasks, and if so, how you plan to standardize them? This clarification is critical for evaluating whether RECBENCH-MD can adapt to the shift from discriminative to generative recommendation, a key trend in the field.
