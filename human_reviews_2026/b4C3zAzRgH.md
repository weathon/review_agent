## Abstract
Motif scaffolding in protein design involves generating complete protein structures while preserving the 3D geometry of designated structural fragments, analogous to image outpainting in computer vision. Current benchmarks focus on functional motifs, leaving general geometric preservation capabilities largely untested. We introduce GeomMotif, a systematic benchmark that evaluates arbitrary structural fragment preservation without requiring functional specificity. We construct 57 benchmark tasks, each containing one or two motifs with up to 7 continuous fragments, by sampling from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to ensure a ground-truth, solvable conformation for every problem. The tasks are characterized by comprehensive structural and physicochemical properties: size, geometric context, secondary structure, hydrophobicity, charge, and degree of burial. These features enable detailed performance analysis beyond simple success rates, revealing model-specific strengths and limitations. We evaluate models using scRMSD and pLDDT for geometric fidelity and clustering for structural diversity and novelty. Our results show that sequence-based and structure-based approaches find different tasks challenging, and that geometric preservation varies significantly with structural and physicochemical context. GeomMotif provides insights complementary to function-focused benchmarks and establishes a foundation for improving protein generative models.

### Summary
The authors introduce GeomMotif, a new benchmark to better evaluate the performance of current motif-scaffolding techniques in de-novo protein design. The benchmark consists of 57 modality-agnostic scaffolding tasks. To ensure systematic coverage of protein structural space, the authors uniformly sample proteins from the PDB containing varying numbers of motifs, ranging from single-motifs to multi-fragment ones with up to 7 fragments. Each motif and fragment is annotated with physicochemical metadata as well. 
For each task, the authors generate scaffolds using multiple methods, demonstrating that the motifs or fragments are indeed "scaffoldable" and hence the tasks solvable. Interestingly, when comparing structure- and sequence-based models, the authors find that structure models outperform sequence-based ones. Sequence-based models struggle particularly with multi-fragment, non-local motifs. They also observe that the secondary structure and other parameters of motifs strongly influences success. Helices are easier to scaffold than β-sheets, and that burial and contact ratio are important determinants of performance. The GeomMotif benchmark is publicly available on github and hugging face for use by the broader research community.

### Strengths
The manuscript is clearly written, and the creation pipeline of GeomMotif is well explained. The benchmark evaluation incl. its feasibility and the comparison between structure-based and sequence-only models reveals several interesting trends, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for these approaches. As expected, structure-based models outperform sequence-only models on this structurally oriented task. Moreover, motifs containing helices are easier to scaffold, a finding consistent with previous observations.

### Weaknesses
No specific weaknesses in the manuscript.

### Questions
I have two questions regarding the benchmark creation:

1. Many motifs include loops or parts of loops. Why did the authors remove these when creating the benchmark instead of including and classifying them as well? This aspect would be important for multiple applications; antibodies being the most obvious example.
2. Does the benchmark include motifs derived from actual protein–protein interactions (PPIs) or enzymes? If so, for the PPI-derived motifs are the corresponding target proteins also included? It would be interesting to see scaffolding evaluated in the presence of the target protein, as this introduces additional constraints on how the scaffold must be generated.

### Summary
This paper introduces **GeomMotif**, a systematic benchmark designed to address a gap in the evaluation of protein motif scaffolding models: the lack of focus on general **geometric preservation**, as opposed to just functional motif preservation.

**Key Contributions:**

*   **A Novel Benchmark:** GeomMotif consists of 57 tasks derived from the PDB, each with a guaranteed ground-truth solution, designed to test the preservation of arbitrary structural fragments.
*   **Detailed Task Characterization:** Tasks are annotated with comprehensive structural and physicochemical properties, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Multi-faceted Evaluation:** The benchmark uses metrics for geometric fidelity (scRMSD, pLDDT) and structural diversity (clustering) to provide a holistic view of model performance.

The results show that different classes of models struggle with different types of geometric challenges, highlighting the utility of this benchmark for guiding future development in protein generative modeling.

### Strengths
1.  **Addresses a Critical Need in the Field:** The paper correctly identifies a significant gap in protein design: the lack of a systematic benchmark for the fundamental task of motif scaffolding. As most functional protein design now relies heavily on preserving specific motifs, the creation of a standardized benchmark to rigorously compare the performance of different scaffolding methods is both timely and important for the community.

2.  **Well-Designed and Comprehensive Evaluation Protocol:** The evaluation protocol is a key strength of this work. It is both reasonable and thorough. The introduction of the **SUN (Successful, Unique, Novel)** metric is particularly noteworthy, as it provides a single, well-motivated score that elegantly integrates the three most critical aspects of generative design performance, moving beyond simplistic success rates.

3.  **Thorough and Diverse Benchmark Construction:** The construction of the benchmark itself is exemplary. The selection and analysis of the motifs are highly detailed and thoughtfully curated to cover a wide and representative range of application scenarios. This comprehensiveness ensures that the benchmark can effectively probe the strengths and weaknesses of different models across various structural and physicochemical contexts.

### Weaknesses
### Weaknesses:

1.  **Exclusion of Small Motifs Limits Scope and Practical Relevance:** The benchmark's decision to exclude motifs with fewer than 30 residues is a notable limitation. In many real-world design scenarios, particularly for active sites or epitope engineering, the critical functional motifs are often very small, sometimes comprising just a few key residues. These small, and often non-contiguous, fragments are notoriously difficult for current models to constrain geometrically. Including a dedicated set of small-motif tasks would not only better reflect practical challenges but also provide a more stringent test of model capabilities, significantly enhancing the benchmark's overall utility.

2.  **Evaluation Could Be Extended to More Recent Methods and Tasks:** While the paper provides a solid comparison of established models, the field of protein generation is advancing rapidly. The benchmark would be more impactful and have greater immediate relevance if it included an evaluation of more recent state-of-the-art models, such as Protpardelle-1c, RFdiffusion2, or Proteina. Additionally, exploring performance on more nuanced motif-scaffolding tasks, like unindex motif-scaffolding, would provide a more comprehensive picture of model capabilities.

3.  **Lack of Focus on Side-Chain Preservation:** The current evaluation protocol is centered on backbone geometry (Cα atoms). However, for most functional applications of motif scaffolding (e.g., designing binders or enzymes), preserving the precise 3D conformation of the motif's *side-chains* is as crucial as preserving the backbone. Many of these functionally critical motifs are the very small ones mentioned in the first point. While the evaluated models are primarily backbone-focused, the benchmark itself would be more forward-looking and comprehensive if it included metrics for side-chain fidelity. Reporting on heavy-atom RMSD for the motif region, for instance, would better assess a model's ability to preserve function and encourage the development of all-atom scaffolding methods.

### Questions
1.  **On the Solvability Criterion and Benchmark Scale:** Regarding the construction of the benchmark, the paper employs a strict criterion for solvability (ESMFold prediction RMSD ≤ 1.0 Å to the PDB structure), which yields a final set of 107 structures. Could the authors comment on the rationale for this strictness? While it guarantees high-quality, predictable scaffolds, it also significantly constrains the diversity and scale of the benchmark. Have the authors considered an alternative definition of solvability more local to the motif itself—for instance, requiring only that the *motif region* is accurately predicted by a structure prediction model? This might allow for a much larger and more diverse set of benchmark tasks while still ensuring that the core scaffolding problem is well-posed.

2.  **Incorporating Functionally Relevant Motifs:** The paper makes a strong case for a benchmark focused purely on *geometric* preservation, distinct from function-focused benchmarks. As a complementary direction, have the authors considered creating a subset of tasks within GeomMotif where the geometric fragments are specifically chosen from known functional sites (e.g., catalytic residues, binding interfaces, or other hotspots)? This could help bridge the gap between geometric and functional challenges, providing valuable insights into whether current models are better or worse at preserving fragments that are known to be functionally important, even when evaluated on purely geometric metrics.

### Summary
The authors construct a motif scaffolding benchmark through selecting diverse proteins from the PDB and computationally selecting motifs. The benchmark only measures whether the motif geometry is maintained after folding the designed sequence. They then compare a wide range of current state of the art protein design models on the benchmark, finding a clear difference between structure based models and sequence based models. The authors further analyze which motifs models find most challenging in terms of structural properties such as secondary structure composition and burial ratios.

### Strengths
Compared to MotifBench, the author's benchmark has a distinct advantage in that it doesn't require the generative model to design a structure because they do not compute self-consistency RMSD and only an RMSD on the motif after folding. This means they can compare structure-based and sequence-based models on the same benchmark. In doing so the authors reveal a significant difference between these two styles of model. Given that all models were run on the same benchmark by the same authors without bias as to a specific model, I believe these kinds of unbiased results are quite beneficial to the research community.

I also appreciated the analysis into which kinds of motifs are difficult for different models. For example the relative ease of scaffolding high helical content motifs and the difficulty with low helical content motifs is something that could be considered part of the folklore of protein design but not has evidence backing up this claim. The difficulty with buried motifs is also interesting and perhaps a new perspective for which motifs can be challenging to scaffold in practice.

### Weaknesses
I believe the motivation for the benchmark given in the introduction is unclear. It is claimed that MotifBench has a diagnostic blindspot in that it conflates geometric preservation with maintenance of function. I think what the authors mean here is that MotifBench requires both motif preservation and a low scRMSD to be a success whereas their benchmark only requires motif preservation and a high pLDDT of the folded structure. I don't see how low scRMSD equates to a test of 'function' for MotifBench. In my mind the main difference is that GeomMotif doesn't require a starting structure so can compare a wider array of models. I  think this should be made clearer.

With regards to comparing structure based and sequence based models, there seems to be quite an unfair advantage given to structure based models because they are allowed 8 MPNN sequences to attempt to find a good sequence that meets the success criteria. However, sequence based models only have 1 sequence to try to find success. It would therefore seem more appropriate to compare 100 structure samples with 8 MPNN sequences each with 800 sequence samples from the sequence generative model i.e. they have the same number of allowable calls to ESMFold to find a success.

I also believe this benchmark missed an opportunity to reduce the noise in the evaluation criteria. The authors use purely computational filters to finally select 57 motif scaffolding tasks from the entire PDB. This seems like quite a small number of tasks given that the hand selected MotifBench benchmark has 30 problems. Computationally selecting tasks opens the possibility of selecting a very large number of tasks. I believe a more comprehensive and lower noise evalauation of different methods could have been achieved with a much large number of motif scaffolding tasks but with fewer attempts at each task. For example, you currently have 100 attempts at each task for a total of 5700 designs. You could have instead picked 5700 motif scaffolding tasks with 1 attempt each which would have covered a much broader array of problems.

This problem is exemplified in Table 2 where the authors attempt to interpret drops in performance at certain numbers of fragments in the motif with some property of a model e.g. stating that Genie2 has a drop in performance at 4-5 fragments but good performance at 1-3 and 6-7 fragments. They then conclude that 'intermediate' complexity is difficult for the model. I personally am unconvinced by this explanation as I see no fundamental reason as to why intermediate numbers of segments should be harder than a large number of segments. I would offer an alternative explanation that simply the 5 tasks with 5 fragments happened to be harder than the other tasks because there is such a small number of tasks per number of fragments bin and the random sample of tasks that had 5 fragments happened to be hard. I think this is to be expected when the total number of tasks is small. If the authors wish to make general conclusions about task difficulty versus number of fragments I think many more tasks should be included in the benchmark.

In terms of writing, I think the clarity of section 4.4 could be improved with a figure since it is hard to make conclusions as a reader just reading stated numbers in the main text.

Overall, I believe the analysis of different models is of interest to the community more so than the benchmark itself due to the aforementioned issues. I am leaning towards a weak accept.

### Questions
Why not include some small motifs in the benchmark? Scaffolding the geometry of small functional sites is also an important capability for protein design models.

Would there be a way to include motifs that have more loop content? Sometimes loops can mediate important interactions and scaffolding their shape would be a practically relevant task.

### Summary
This paper presents GeomMotif, a benchmark for evaluating geometric preservation in protein generation. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing on functional motifs, GeomMotif targets general structural fragments, assessing a model’s ability to maintain 3D geometry during motif scaffolding. The authors construct 57 benchmark tasks from the Protein Data Bank, covering diverse structural and physicochemical contexts. Results show that different model classes (sequence-based vs. structure-based) have distinct strengths, highlighting the challenge of arbitrary geometric preservation. Overall, GeomMotif provides a systematic and general framework for assessing geometry-aware protein generation.

### Strengths
- Clearly defines an important and underexplored evaluation problem in protein generation—geometric preservation.  
- Proposes a well-constructed and diverse benchmark with 57 tasks covering various structural and physicochemical contexts.  
- Provides systematic evaluation metrics (scRMSD, pLDDT) that go beyond success rates and enable detailed model comparison.  
- Offers valuable insights into the complementary strengths of sequence-based and structure-based generative models.

### Weaknesses
- Lacks direct comparison with existing motif-scaffolding benchmarks (e.g., the RFDiffusion benchmark), which would better highlight the novelty and distinct contributions of GeomMotif.  
- The evaluation focuses mainly on general geometric cases, without testing more complex or realistic scenarios such as symmetric motifs, small functional motifs, or protein target chains as motifs, which would demonstrate broader applicability.

### Questions
Q1 The paper constructs a diverse set of 57 benchmark tasks and systematically evaluates existing models. Could the authors further **categorize these tasks** (e.g., by difficulty, biochemical properties, or structural complexity) to form **tiered subsets** that would facilitate more detailed and interpretable future evaluations?

Q2 The selection of structure-based baselines seems limited to Genie2, RFdiffusion, and FrameFlow. Could the authors clarify the rationale behind this choice and consider including **more recent methods** such as Proteina or RFdiffusion2 to provide a more comprehensive comparison?
