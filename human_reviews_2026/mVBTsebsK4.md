## Abstract
We initiate the study of decision-making under coupled uncertainties. In this problem, a learner has access to ground truth and coarse measurements of outcomes and would like to use them for decision-making. The learner has constrained access to ground truth measurements for only a given fraction of decision outcomes and would like to leverage the cheaper coarse measurements of decision outcomes. We introduce a model where the randomness of the ground and coarse measurements is coupled, and our approach learns their correlation to optimally combine coarse measurements with ground truth and achieve improved performance. This framework unifies several settings, like learning from multi-fidelity data sources and delegating decision-making to AI agents. We provide an upper confidence bounds based algorithm $\mathrm{CUUCB}$ for leveraging coupled uncertainties in a multi-armed bandit task, where the covariance structure between coarse measurements and ground truth is unknown. We show theoretically how $\mathrm{CUUCB}$ adapts to the underlying covariance structure by deriving instance-dependent and instance-independent regret bounds. We validate our algorithm in two experiments: a task with synthetically generated data, and an LLM benchmarking task. We compare our algorithm to existing $\mathrm{UCB}$ variants with access to only ground truth measurements on the constrained fraction of outcomes. In both cases, our algorithm is able to achieve lower regret.

### Summary
The paper studies a multi-fidelity K-armed bandit problem where, at each pull, the learner may obtain a cheap coarse measurement and, on a controlled fraction of pulls, an expensive ground-truth measurement. When ground truth is queried, the corresponding coarse measurement is also observed. The authors propose CUUCB, a UCB-style algorithm that uses a variance-reduced estimator to combine the two feedback types, while enforcing a per-arm cap on the fraction of ground truth queries. They prove instance-dependent and instance-independent regret bounds whose leading constant improves with the correlation between coarse and ground truth measurements. Experiments on synthetic data and an LLM-as-a-judge benchmarking task show regret improvements over UCB-V under limited ground truth budgets and when there is misalignment.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides a clear link to practical applications like LLM evaluation. 

2. Variance-reduced estimators are clearly defined, and regret analysis looks rigorous. The analysis shows improvement over baseline UCB-V

3. Given the importance of prediction-power inference, this paper represents a timely problem that is of interest to the greater ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
1. Reading the first three sections first gives the reader (wrong) the sense that this paper is addressing a very general problem in the contextual bandit setting. The motivating examples are indeed contextual in nature. Section 4 then suddenly jumps to the K-armed stochastic bandit, which is not aligned with the expectations that the first three sections build. The motivation is strong and broad, but the contribution of the paper does not correctly align with its motivation. The scope of the solution is narrow. It is also not clear how the findings (estimators and algorithm) can be extended to contextual setups and setups with a large number of arms.

2. A known upper bound on the variance ratio is a strong assumption. Discussion of robustness to misspecification would strengthen the work.

3. The regret bound improves over UCB-V by exploiting coupled uncertainties in the upper confidence bound, but there is no accompanying lower bound. Without a lower bound, it is not clear if what is done optimally utilizes the correlations between ground truth and coarse measurements. 

4. The simple thresholding rule decouples when to sample ground-truth from when to choose a particular arm. While it simplifies the algorithm design, it is not clear what is lost in terms of optimality with such a choice. It also aims for an anytime guarantee on the ratio of ground truths obtained. Since the time horizon is known (input to Algorithm 1), why should one enforce an anytime guarantee on the ground truth ratio? For instance, in the LLM example, having a ground truth budget is more realistic (and less stringent) than requiring an anytime guarantee on the ground truth ratio.

5. Experiments are somewhat limited in scope. In particular, LLMs are used as ground truth proxies rather than human labels.

6. Experiments consider a very small number of arms. How will the improvement scale as the number of arms increase?

### Questions
1. How sensitive is CUUCB to misspecification of the $\gamma$ parameter?

2. Can the framework extend naturally to contextual bandits or reinforcement learning settings? The introduction hints at this but does not elaborate.

3. How robust is CUUCB when coarse and ground-truth data are weakly correlated or adversarially misaligned?

### Summary
This paper investigates decision-making under coupled uncertainties, where a learner has access to both ground-truth and coarse measurements of outcomes. The authors introduce a model in which these two types of feedback are statistically coupled, and the proposed approach learns their correlation to optimally combine coarse measurements with limited ground-truth feedback for improved performance. The method leverages confidence bounds that exploit the correlation structure between the measurements to reduce uncertainty and enhance decision accuracy.

### Strengths
This paper is the first to explore the use of coupled random variables through ground-truth and coarse measurements in a bandit framework. The proposed approach effectively leverages the correlation between these measurements to extract additional information from coarse feedback, resulting in improved performance.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is the novelty of the algorithm. The proposed method heavily relies on the AIPW estimator, which has been extensively studied in prior work, including Robins & Rotnitzky (1995) and more recently Angelopoulos et al. (2024). 


To strengthen the positioning of the contribution, it would also be beneficial to include relevant bandit literature with offline samples in the related work section.

### Questions
Could you elaborate on the novelty of the proposed algorithm and its technical contributions relative to prior work on AIPW-based methods?

### Summary
The paper studies a bandit setting with coupled uncertainty, where coarse and ground-truth feedback are correlated within the same arm. This assumption is relevant to recent RLHF-style problems where proxy and human feedback overlap. The authors extend the UCB framework with an explicit covariance estimator and provide finite-sample regret bounds. The paper is clearly written and theoretically sound, but the contribution is incremental: the formulation is close to existing correlated and multi-fidelity bandits, and the experiments are small in scale without strong baselines.

### Strengths
**1. Correlated uncertainty assumption is relevant to recent RLHF research**

The assumption that coarse and ground-truth feedback are correlated is realistic and aligns well with recent work in reinforcement learning from human feedback, where model-generated and human-provided signals often overlap but differ in precision. This framing connects the problem to practical and timely settings such as AI-assisted evaluation or LLM-as-a-judge feedback.

**2. Clear extension of UCB using an explicit covariance estimator**

The paper extends the standard UCB framework by explicitly estimating and incorporating the covariance between coarse and ground-truth feedback. The modification is simple but coherent, illustrating how correlated signals can be used to refine exploration in a principled way. The algorithm is clearly presented and easy to understand.

**3. Complete and well-structured theoretical analysis**

The paper provides finite-sample concentration bounds and regret guarantees under standard assumptions. The analysis is internally consistent and clearly written, reflecting a solid grasp of the theory. While the results build on established techniques, the presentation is thorough and self-contained.

### Weaknesses
**1. The distinction from correlated and multi-fidelity bandits is conceptually minor**

The paper introduces coupled uncertainty as a new setting where coarse and ground-truth feedback are correlated within the same arm. While this idea is clearly stated, similar correlation structures have been studied in related bandit frameworks. The difference between intra-arm and cross-arm correlation is understandable, but the paper does not convincingly show that it leads to fundamentally new challenges or insights. The conceptual contribution feels incremental rather than fundamental.

**2. Limited methodological novelty and technical depth**

The approach estimates the covariance between coarse and ground-truth feedback and integrates it into a UCB-style algorithm. This design follows well-known variance-reduction ideas from existing inference and bandit literature. The theoretical results are correct and clearly written but rely on familiar concentration and regret analyses. The work extends established methods in a careful but modest way, without introducing new technical insights or algorithmic innovations.

**3. Empirical validation is shallow and lacks comparison with relevant baselines**

The experiments are limited to a toy synthetic setting and a small-scale LLM-as-a-judge example. These results illustrate the idea but do not convincingly demonstrate practical advantages. Comparisons are restricted to UCB and UCB-V, while more relevant baselines such as correlated Gaussian-process bandits, multi-fidelity UCB variants, or other structured methods are not included. Without such baselines, it is difficult to evaluate whether the proposed algorithm offers meaningful empirical improvements.

### Summary
This paper investigates decision-making when “coupled uncertainties” are present, a setting where high-quality (ground truth) and lower-quality (coarse) measurements are available for each decision. The authors introduce a formal framework modeling the correlation between the two uncertainty sources, propose CUUCB, a variance-adaptive upper confidence bound bandit algorithm that empirically estimates this correlation and combines both sources to reduce regret. Theoretical analyses show instance-dependent and instance-independent regret bounds, and experiments on synthetic data and LLM-based benchmarking tasks provide empirical validation.

### Strengths
- The authors present a well-motivated formalization of decision-making with coupled uncertainty, capturing practical scenarios where high- and low-fidelity feedback is available (e.g., LLM-as-a-judge, scientific experiments).
- Detailed regret bounds are provided (Theorem 5.3), including explicit dependence on the unknown correlation coefficients.

### Weaknesses
1. While the main regret analysis is technically strong, the presentation repeatedly relies on boundedness (Assumption 4.1) and a known, global variance ratio bound (Assumption 4.2).
2. Almost all experiments focus on synthetic Gaussian mixtures or LLM ranking datasets where the coarse and ground-truth are directly constructed. It’s unclear whether the benefits of CUUCB persist for realistic scenarios where feedback is more complex or structured (for example, heterogeneous or contextual bandits).
3. The LLM benchmarking task defines ground-truth using a ‘more advanced LLM’ rather than real human labels, which may bias the coarse/ground-truth correlation estimation.
4. The paper occasionally overstates generalizability, stating that the “framework unifies several settings, like multi-fidelity learning, AI delegation, etc.” without presenting evidence in all such scenarios. There is little discussion of when the approach could underperform (e.g., when coarse and ground-truth are misaligned and weakly correlated, or empirical covariance estimation is unstable).

### Minor comments
5. Quotation around best on line 459 is not opened and closed properly.

### Questions
1. In LLM-as-judge, how representative is using a stronger LLM as “ground truth”?
2. What is the computational overhead for updating covariances at large $K$?
3. How does empirical covariance estimation error affect regret, particularly for small $N$ or weak correlation?
