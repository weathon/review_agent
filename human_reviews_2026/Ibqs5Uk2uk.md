- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 2, 6, 6

## Abstract
Antigenic epitope presented by major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) proteins plays an essential role in immunotherapy. However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are  smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide–MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen–MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.

### Summary
This paper presents a large and standardized human MHC-II dataset encompassing peptide binding affinity, peptide presentation, and a novel antigen-level presentation task with antigen annotations. It introduces a multi-scale evaluation framework featuring a new coverage-redundancy AUC (CR-AUC) metric for antigen localization. The proposed sequence and structure aware models, utilizing ESM2 embeddings and predicted MHC-II structures, are evaluated through ablation studies. Results demonstrate improvements in antigen-level localization and competitive peptide-level performance against recent baselines.

### Strengths
The adaptive immune system is highly complex, and CD4+ T cells play a central role, yet predicting their behavior remains challenging. By framing this problem for the machine learning community, the work opens opportunities for novel computational approaches and insights. Additionally, computational studies in this area often rely on different datasets and metrics, making method-level comparisons difficult. This work addresses this issue by curating a standardized dataset and clearly defining tasks with corresponding evaluation metrics, enabling rigorous and fair comparisons across methods.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of this paper is clarity. The definitions of evaluation metrics and associated notations are not clearly presented, and key methodological details are deferred to the appendix. While the authors propose a new method, as a dataset and benchmark paper, the focus should primarily be on the dataset and existing methods. The proposed method could constitute a separate manuscript. The usage of baselines within the benchmark is also not clearly described. From a technical perspective, important metrics such as generalization ability are missing from the evaluation. Additionally, the performance table shows minor differences between results, but no statistical significance tests are reported.

### Questions
1. **Figure 1**: There is a red bar in the third space. What does it represent?  
2. **Section 3.4**: In the data enrichment section, the authors mention using ESM2 embeddings as pseudo-labels. If this refers to the proposed model in the appendix, this section should be rephrased to clearly explain how pseudo-labeling works.  
3. **Line 334 and 355**: Please define $\mathbb{1}$ (the double-stroked "1").  
4. **Line 350**: Please define $w_n$ and $w_{n'}$.  
5. **Table 4**: The "ours" model is compared in Table 4 but described only in the appendix, which may confuse readers. As this is primarily a dataset paper, the new method could be better presented as a separate manuscript.  
6. **Tables 3 and 4**: Some differences (e.g., AUC for BA and AUC epitope for Eluted Ligand) are minor. Including statistical significance tests would strengthen the analysis.  
7. Generalization is an important metric for this task. Adding a holdout evaluation would be valuable. 
8. Characterizing how antigens with annotations differ from the full antigenome would be valuable.  
9. Were all baselines (NetMHCIIpan4.3, MixMHC2Pred2, RPEMHC, ImmuScope) re-run on this benchmark, or were pretrained weights used? Please clarify how peptide length and amino-acid constraints were handled for each baseline.  
10. (*Optional*) For the antigen-level annotation and presentation task, is it possible to incorporate structure-aware antigen processing prediction methods (e.g., APL [Charles, 2022, Biochem.] and GPUCOREX [Li, 2024, BIBM]) using AlphaFold-predicted structures?
11. (*Optional*) Since many biological researchers still use legacy tools such as NNAlign provided by IEDB, including additional baselines covering these commonly used methods could make the benchmark more relevant and encourage the community to adopt newer approaches.

### Summary
This paper aims to model the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway from processing, binding, to presentation, which requires the effective integration of biological context information, binding affinity measurements, and eluted ligand data. To capture peptide–MHC interactions, the authors employed a cross-attention mechanism between the MHC molecule and the peptide, and identified several key factors that contribute to improved predictive performance, including the use of ESM-derived representations, MHC structural features, joint learning, and auxiliary binding-core prediction. To further enrich contextual modeling, the authors extended the prediction scope from peptide level to antigen-protein level, leveraging source protein data collected from IEDB for model training. This extension demonstrates significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared with conventional peptide-based approaches.

### Strengths
1. Modeling MHC-II antigen presentation directly from the antigen-protein perspective is an interesting and meaningful research direction. 

2. The combination of MHC ESM embeddings and structural features effectively enhances predictive performance.

3. The description of the dataset and modeling details is clear, well-structured, and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of the work is limited. 
a) The proposed network architecture is highly similar to ImmuScope, with only minor modifications. 
b) The use of joint training (as in NetMHCpan-4.0), binding core prediction (NetMHCIIpan-3.2), ESM embeddings (HLAIIpolo, Pep2Vec), and structural features (NetMHCpan-4.2) for performance enhancement is already well-established in the field of MHC-II peptide presentation. 
c) Moreover, recent versions of NetMHCIIpan (≥4.0) have already incorporated peptide context information, which has been shown to substantially improve presentation prediction performance, further diminishing the claimed novelty of this study. 

2. The experimental design is insufficient and potentially biased. 
a) Since antigen presentation is the central focus of this paper, Table 5 lacks comparative experiments with existing methods; at minimum, results from peptide-based baselines should be included for fair comparison. 
b) Additionally, the peptide-based prediction appears to be conducted using the entire protein sequence, whereas the antigen-based prediction is restricted to k-length fragments of the protein, which artificially reduces the search space and may lead to unfair performance advantages.
c) In addition to the lack of T-cell data and multi-allele samples, the authors could include more experiments to demonstrate that their dataset offers better quality compared with existing BA and EL datasets, rather than only being a combination of multiple sources.

### Questions
Major 
1. The authors should include a diagram of the model architecture to clearly illustrate the framework to readers, including the key components for both peptide-level and antigen-level presentation modeling. Moreover, based on the textual description, the architecture appears very similar to ImmuScope encoder. The authors must explicitly highlight the creative differences and methodological innovations that distinguish their work from ImmuScope.

2. In Tables 3–5, the accuracy metric appears to be biased, as the threshold is fixed at 0.5. In contrast, NetMHCIIpan reports a top-ranked percentile score, which is normalized and therefore may provide a more appropriate decision threshold (top-20% or top-30%) than a fixed 0.5 cutoff.

3. In Table 5, additional comparisons with other peptide-based methods are necessary, especially considering the NetMHCIIpan-4.3 with context information used.

4. The peptide-based prediction appears to use the full-length protein sequence, applying a fixed 9-mer sliding window. In contrast, the antigen-based prediction seems to be conducted on k-length fragments, which reduces the effective search space and may artificially inflate the reported accuracy. 

5. In the Method Comparison section, it is unclear whether the other models were retrained on the same dataset or evaluated using their original parameters. If they were not retrained, could this affect the fairness of the comparison? Additional clarification is needed.

Minor 
1. In Table 1, the data statistics are inconsistent with the textual description. For instance, the text mentions 141K BA pairs covering 78 MHC-II molecules, whereas Table 1 reports 136K pairs and 77 MHC-IIs. Please verify and ensure consistency between the text and tables. 

2. The use of highly complex features, such as ESM and structure features, may negatively affect computational efficiency. It is recommended to include a running time to demonstrate the model efficiency.

### Summary
The authors collect a large dataset of 1.2M peptides interacting with 134 unique human MHC-II. This is certainly useful for the community, since many researchers are now attempting to predict immunological properties (such as antigenic immunogenicity) with data-hungry machine learning methods.

Although certainly very valuable, my only concern is whether ICLR is the best venue for this paper. Modeling contributions are minor: the architecture is standard (sequence encoders + cross-attention) and benchmarked against known baselines. Their model performs comparably, or marginally better.

### Strengths
The authors collect a large dataset of 1.2M peptides with 134 unique human MHC-II, labeled as positives or negatives depending on the interaction and whether the peptide is presented or not. This is certainly a welcome and valuable resource. They introduce an antigen-level prediction task and evaluation framework.

They enrich the dataset with annotations from multiple sources, such as ESM2 residue embeddings, predicted peptide binding motifs from MoDec, inferred structures by AlphaFold3, and others. These annotations will surely facilitate downstream work by other researchers.

They present a model of standard architecture (sequence encoders + cross-attention) trained on their dataset, and evaluated on 3 prediction tasks. Their model performs comparably, or marginally better than other state-of-the-art approaches.

### Weaknesses
One issue that the authors discuss is that the data for some MHC is very unbalanced. They attempt to rebalance by generating negatives by ad hoc data augmentation techniques.

The paper has little representation learning content, so my only concern is whether ICLR is the best venue for this work. In fact, the model they use for predictions is only described in the Appendix, with little mention given in the main text.

### Questions
- Can the authors describe in more detail their model in the main text?
- Although the dataset is certainly valauable, I believe the authors should justify the novelty of their modeling approach in order to fit a venue such as ICLR.

### Summary
This paper presents a well-curated dataset for predicting MHC-II antigen presentation. The authors integrate and standardize data from IEDB and other public sources, introducing not only peptide-level but also antigen-level tasks for the first time. They propose a multi-scale evaluation framework and conduct experiments comparing various input features, model architectures, and training strategies. The antigen-based modeling approach shows promising results in localizing epitope regions within full antigen sequences, outperforming peptide-based models in region-level coverage-redundancy analysis.

### Strengths
This manuscript introduces antigen-level prediction for MHC-II, with a novel evaluation metric (CR-AUC). In addition, it has rigorous dataset curation, extensive experiments, and thorough ablation studies. The manuscript is well organized and clearly written. Furthermore, it provides a good resource for the community and advances the modeling of MHC-II antigen presentation.

### Weaknesses
The model underperforms in peptide-binding affinity (BA) prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods like RPEMHC and NetMHCIIpan4.3, an issue the authors attribute to checkpoint selection bias but which could be addressed more systematically. Furthermore, the study is limited to single-allele data and does not handle the more complex but common real-world scenario of multi-allelic mass spectrometry samples. The antigen-level modeling is also potentially impacted by missing antigen annotations for a subset of peptides, which may introduce bias. Most critically, the training labels (BA and eluted ligands) are only proxy signals for immunogenicity, and the models do not incorporate direct T-cell response data due to its scarcity, leaving a gap between prediction and actual immune recognition.

### Questions
1. Could authors explore alternative checkpoint selection strategies (e.g., task-specific early stopping) to improve BA performance without compromising EL results?
2. How might the missing antigen annotations affect model generalizability? Is there a way to quantify or mitigate this bias?
3. The structural inputs help in EL but not consistently in BA. Why is that? Could this be due to the smaller BA dataset? Would scaling the BA data help?
