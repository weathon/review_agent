## Abstract
Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited.
To enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.

### Summary
In the paper, "AD-NODE: Adaptive dynamics learning with neural ODEs for mobile robots control," the authors propose an approach to learning adaptive dynamics models parameterized by neural ODEs that can be used in model-based planners such as MPC. The 2-stage approach first learns a latent representation of the environment from priviliged information, and then trains an adaptive module that estimates the same latent vector from state histories. The adaptive module can then be used at runtime to estimate the latent representation vector to tune the dynamics model to the environment. 

Overall, I think this paper has potential, but I would like to see a stronger justification for the proposed approach and clearer contrasts with existing work. The experimental section could also benefit from more qualitative descriptions of the results. With these improvements, I believe the paper could make a solid contribution.

### Strengths
- The problem of adaptation for robotics and autonomous systems is timely and relevant. The approach is interesting, and could certainly be useful for making robots that can adapt to different environments at runtime. I would like to see a little more about the practical robotics side, such as how much training data is needed to work effectively, how many different environments and parameter variations are needed to train a good latent representation, how quickly the model can adapt on on-board hardware, etc. 

- The experiments and baseline comparisons are comprehensive and (mostly) convincing. Barring my comments regarding the interpretability of some of the results, the experiments and baseline comparisons do a good job of evaluating the proposed approach for the task of adapting to different environments. 

- The theoretical contribution of the paper appears solid.

- The paper is (mostly) well-written. There are a few areas where grammatical tools could help improve the readability or flow of the paper. For instance, even the title "AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robots Control" could be improved to "AD-NODE: Adaptive Dynamics Learning with Neural ODEs for Mobile Robot Control" (removing the plural on "robots" to sound more natural).

### Weaknesses
- My biggest comment is that the authors have not done enough to compare/contrast their work with RMA. RMA takes a very similar approach, but the learned object is a policy network instead of a neural ODE. The 2-stage training procedure and adaptation approach are otherwise virtually identical. What is novel about this work when compared to RMA in terms of architecture or approach? What benefit do we get aside from being model-based? Without such a comparison, the theoretical and algorithmic contribution appears minor.

  For instance, one might argue that the closed-loop policy performance of RMA confers significant benefits over the proposed approach in this paper by not needing to simulate rollouts and optimize on the fly, which can be a significant online computational burden. 

  Why not compare the downstream performance of the proposed model-based method with the existing model-free RMA approach? This seems like the clearest baseline from existing work. What performance benefits are there versus the RL-based policy? 

- The contrasts with related work do not clearly spell out how the proposed approach overcomes the issues faced by existing methods. The contrasts point out some common criticism of other existing approaches, such as excessive training data or limited OOD generalization, but the authors do not clearly explain how their approach overcomes these issues. As it stands, this makes the paper feel less well-motivated. What gap or limitation is the proposed approach fixing? 
  
  The authors contrast with existing work (Kumar 2021, Zhang 2023) by saying that these approaches require large amounts of interaction data and demonstrate low sample efficiency, but do not say how their approach overcomes this downside. Simply changing to a model-based method does not alleviate this issue, and may make things worse for MPC/MPPI if the resulting model has significant model mismatch. 

  The same holds true for the other related works. The authors say that meta-learning struggles with out-of-distribution generalization (this is a strong claim), but wouldn't the proposed method suffer from the same downside? It's not clear how (or if) the proposed approach handles new, unseen environments not encountered during training, whereas meta-learning approaches like MAML can theoretically handle truly novel tasks or environments since they fine-tune online. 

  Without a clear contrast that demonstrates the benefits of the proposed approach over existing work, it is difficult to see exactly what advantages this approach has over existing work. The paper would significantly benefit from a clearer justification and expanded discussion.

  As a minor comment, the related work also neglects some work in robotics for adaptation to novel environments/terrains. Expanding on this could strengthen the paper to demonstrate a clearer need for the proposed approach. 

- The experimental section in the main paper could benefit greatly from a more qualitative description of the performance of the controller versus the baselines. As it stands, it is difficult to determine the relative performance of the controller in the different setups. 

  How do the final trajectories look for the different models? Is there a noticeable difference or does MPPI handle the mismatch? 

  How quickly do the dynamics adapt to the new terrain? Is it possible to clearly distinguish the dynamics on the different surfaces? This is currently lacking in the experimental section.

### Questions
My questions are mostly related to the weaknesses above and are the biggest points I would like see addressed:

1. How does the proposed approach compare with RMA? The two approaches appear very similar, except that RMA learns a policy network instead of a dynamics model for MPC. What are the benefits of the proposed approach over RMA? Why not compare the downstream performance of the proposed method with RMA, or at least discuss the comparative differences between them?

2. The contrasts with related work do not clearly spell out how the proposed approach overcomes the issues faced by existing methods. What gap or limitation is the proposed approach fixing? How does the proposed approach overcome the downsides of existing work?

3. The experimental section in the main paper could benefit greatly from a more qualitative description of the performance of the controller versus the baselines. How do the final trajectories look for the different models? Is there a noticeable difference or does MPPI handle the mismatch? How quickly do the dynamics adapt to the new terrain? Is it possible to clearly distinguish the dynamics on the different surfaces? This is currently lacking in the experimental section.

An ode-based two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations for improving system dynamic tracking performance. In Phase 1, privileged environmental information ek is used to encoder latent dynamics zk. Next, the historical data is employed to reconstruct the latent dynamics. Lastly, the further motion state is predicted via state net module. Several tests are arranged to preliminarily validate the effectiveness.
Questions:
(1)	Although data-based methods can be very effective, the quality of their results depends on the quality of the data used for identification. In this case, the data used came from a system like quadrotor with a specific closed-loop control parameters, and is therefore only effective under these conditions. If the gains change (for example, during adjustments from the ground station), does the offline training model need to be re-obtained? The generalization in unseen environments should be provided in the manuscript.

### Summary
The paper proposes adaptive dynamics NODE (AD-NODE), a learned dynamics model for model predictive control (MPC) of mobile robots that can adapt to environmental changes at runtime. The dynamics are modelled as neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) that can be numerically integrated (e.g. forward Euler) to obtain the system state. The authors take inspiration from rapid motor adaptation (RMA) and train a latent embedding representing the current environment condition that is given to the NODE network as input. To better handle out-of-distribution parts of the state space, online fine-tuning of the learned dynamics model based on recorded trajectories from an experience replay buffer is included. The performance of AD-NODE is validated on a simulated and real differential drive robot and on a simulated quadrotor drone. AD-NODE is compared to several baselines and improvements in control performance are demonstrated.

### Strengths
* AD-NODE combines two known approaches from the literature, NODE as a dynamics model and RMA for adaptation to changing environment conditions, in an incremental but novel way and uses it for a sampling-based MPC.
* The paper validates AD-NODE for two robotic systems in simulation and real world experiments and showcase an improvement in performance, especially compared to NODE without adaptation.
* Their proposed online fine-tuning of the dynamics helps with out-of-distribution cases at test time in the simulated quadrotor control experiments.
* The paper reports an MPC planning time of less than 0.01 seconds for several hundred parallel planning roll-outs, highlighting the real-time capability of their approach.

### Weaknesses
* In the related work section, the paper misses works on dynamics model learning for navigation from the robotics community such as
  - Guttikonda et al. Context-Conditional Navigation with a Learning-Based Terrain- and Robot-Aware Dynamics Model. ECMR 2023.
  - Vertens et al. Improving deep dynamics models for autonomous vehicles with multimodal latent mapping of surfaces. IROS 2023.
* In figure 2.b): Why does the state-net output x_k+1 in phase 1 and x_k in phase 2? Shouldn't this be x_k in both cases? 
* Experiments are conducted with simplified robot models in simulation or a differential drive robot in a simplified setup on a flat table with artificial friction changes. The paper should discuss limitations and assumptions and how they could be addressed to scale to more complex real robots like wheeled robots with suspension or more complex terrain interactions including soft or granular terrain. The model-free RL approach RMA demonstrates applicability in more realistic settings, e.g., it evaluates RMA extensively in various outdoor scenarios for a quadruped robot.
* When online finetuning the dynamics model, why does the parametrization by the latent vector not diverge from the learned mapping of state history to environment properties?
* Sec. 5.4, why is the wind limited to the x-direction? Does it work with wind in 2D ?
* Presenting results with 2 or 3 digits after the floating point should be sufficient in most cases.
* How is the friction coefficient measured in the real robot experiment in Sec. 6.2 ?
* Sec 6.3, please explain the main ideas of the cost function design in the main paper.

### Questions
* Please address the points raised in the "weaknesses" section.

### Summary
The paper proposes AD-NODE, an adaptive dynamics learning framework for mobile robot control that integrates Neural ODE with Model Predictive Control (MPC). The method infers hidden environmental variations (e.g., terrain friction, wind) from state–action history rather than explicit sensors, enabling continuous-time adaptation. AD-NODE is trained in two phases: learning dynamics with privileged environmental information, and reconstructing latent environmental embeddings from history for partially observed settings. The approach is validated on a 2D differential wheeled robot, a 3D quadrotor, and a real Sphero BOLT robot, showing superior performance in both goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks under spatially and temporally varying conditions compared to CaDM, meta-learning, and fixed NODE baselines

### Strengths
- Clear Motivation for Adaptive Dynamics. The paper articulates a strong motivation: existing model-based controllers struggle under unmodeled environmental variations, and most model-free approaches (e.g., RMA) are data-hungry. Section 1 convincingly situates AD-NODE as a bridge between adaptive RL and continuous-time modeling

### Weaknesses
- While the paper addresses adaptive dynamics modeling for model-based control, similar ideas have recently appeared in AnyCar to Anywhere: Learning Universal Dynamics Model for Agile and Adaptive Mobility (ICRA 2025), which also employs a Transformer-based dynamics model that takes state–action history to predict future states and achieve agile mobility in the wild. Compared to that line of work, the present submission offers limited methodological novelty in both the dynamics learning and controller design; the main contribution appears to be an integration of existing modules (NODE + MPC) into a coherent system. As such, the paper’s emphasis may align more closely with robotics systems or planning venues rather than introducing a fundamentally new learning or control algorithm.

### Questions
- Given the focus on mobile robots, can the authors comment on whether the NODE-based dynamics would remain tractable for higher-dimensional systems like quadrupeds or manipulators, where the ODE solver overhead grows rapidly?
