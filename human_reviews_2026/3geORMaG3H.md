# Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 6, 8, 2

## Abstract
Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a general computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference \& Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on two distinct ISPs: a canonical agricultural landscape management problem and a carbon-aware EV charging time slot usage problem. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated agent behavior with system-level goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a implementable set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

### Summary
This paper applies the idea of Evolutionary Search with LLMs to the problems of (1) navigating an ill-structured collective action dilemma (agricultural landscape management) and (2) finding appropriate heuristics to resolve the dilemma. Specifically, they introduce the ECHO-MIMIC method where the ECHO component comes up with creative but useful heuristics and nudges, the MIMIC part then tries to convince an agent to use them.

### Strengths
- The paper seems original in the sense that I haven't seen an LLM-driven evolutionary search approach being taking for any collective action problem. I get the impression that proper effort has been put into getting a good design of their method ECHO-MIMIC. The paper writing was clear.
- I like that this paper chose to a test case that, from a first glance, seems to capture much of the complexity of a real-world collective action problem

### Weaknesses
Most of my overall negative assessment of this paper is based on the fact that I do not view this contribution as significant enough to the ICLR community. I am interested to hear from the AC and other reviewers how they feel about it. I will elaborate on two complementary fronts on which I feel like the paper has not demonstrated yet that their main contribution, the method ECHO-MIMIC, is effective.
- What evidence do we have that a capable LLM agent, say in two years time, is not able to surpass the performance of ECHO-MIMIC with the newest LLM at that time? ECHO-MIMIC is introducing a lot of constraining structure onto the problem of solving the agricultural landscape management issue. They present DSPy MiPROv2 as "a strong LLM-native baseline", and show that ECHO-MIMIC performs much better. But I yet have to feel convinced that a framework like ECHO-MIMIC can hold its ground against increasingly capable general LLM agent scaffolds that can be prompted to resolve the collective action problem. I suggest adding a side by side comparisons of how ECHO-MIMIC scales with stronger base LLMs vs how a general LLM agent framework scales with stronger base LLMs. 
- While the agricultural landscape management is interesting to our society in its own right, I do not think that it is sufficiently interesting to the ICLR community to serve as the only test bed for your method. It is hard to gauge how generalizable your insights about ECHO-MIMIC are *beyond* your particular problem of interest (say, other collective action problems or social dilemmas). To me, the current narrative and focus of the paper seems to fit much better into non-ML venues with a stronger emphasis on solving individual collective action problems. (This is despite acknowledging that your method ECHO-MIMIC is fully ML-based.) 
- Less important, but maybe also illustrating the point above: The paper did not put much effort into putting their work in the context of related ML/AI work that is addressing (ecological) collective action problems / social dilemmas.

### Questions
When you decided to tackle the ill structured problem through a dual approach on the agent level as well as on the global policy maker level, what factors drove your decision to introduce a policy level agent specifically with regards to how much power you give it for influencing the individual agents? I am asking this because there are many ways to resolve a social dilemma from the perspective of a policy maker with different powers; for example, through reputation systems, contracts, mediation, etc.

### Summary
The authors present ECHO-MIMIC, a two-stage computational framework that transforms collective action problems, framed as Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs), into Well-Structured Problems (WSPs) for individual agents.
ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves executable heuristics, snippets of code encoding behavioural policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) generates persuasive natural-language messages that motivate agents to adopt those heuristics. Both modules use large-language-model-guided evolutionary search and population-level selection within a simulated environment to optimise for global performance.
Demonstrated on an agricultural landscape management problem, ECHO-MIMIC discovers effective local heuristics and accompanying messages that align farmer behaviour with landscape-level ecological goals. This work reframes the challenge of collective action as an agent-level policy discovery and communication problem, offering a scalable route to adaptive policy design.

### Strengths
- Novel approach using evolutionary algorithms and LLMs to adaptively design policies for decision-making
- Interesting idea on the "nudging" mechanism

### Weaknesses
- End-to-end example prompt & completion outputs would be helpful in the main body of the paper and help clarify the core ideas and hypothesis, 
- I would be interested in more detailed resutls and discussion on the "nudging" mechanism.
- Diagrams could be more legible and help the reader understand the projects much quicker.
- I gave a "fair" for Presentation because I believe the clarity and flow of the paper could be improved significantly

### Questions
- Can agents refuse "Nudge Messages"?
- On high-level afaik, nudge messages are compiled using collective local information, however I wonder if hirarchical or some parts of the nudge message might be more important than others depending on the local condition. For example, the "message" i receive from my direct neighbour might be more helpful to take action, the "message" from a farmer on the other side of the board not so much.

### Summary
This paper proposes ECHO-MIMIC, a two‑phase LLM‑guided evolutionary framework that turns messy collective‑action problems into executable local rules and matching persuasive messages. ECHO evolves short Python programs that map each agent’s local state to actions: first to imitate profit‑seeking baseline behavior (Stage 2), then to aim at a system objective (in their case, landscape ecological connectivity measured by IIC) subject to mild economic constraints (Stage 3). MIMIC then evolves natural‑language nudges tailored to agent personas (Resistant, Economic, Social) that are evaluated by having a "Farm LLM" edit its baseline code in response to the message (Stage 4). ECHO beats DSPy MiPROv2 on both baseline imitation and global‑target learning, and MIMIC outperforms a DSPy messaging baseline on most farms (Table 1, p.9).

### Strengths
This paper presents a genuinely novel synthesis of evolutionary computation and large language models for tackling collective action problems. The framing of ill-structured problems into a series of well-structured subproblems is both conceptually strong and well justified. The implementation of ECHO-MIMIC is technically sound: the evolutionary loop is clear, the operator analysis is detailed, and the authors provide transparent code-fitness tracking. The connection between code complexity and heuristic performance (Fig. 3, p. 7) adds credibility that the model is actually learning something non-trivial rather than just overfitting toy patterns. The integration of behavioral messaging through MIMIC is also compelling, the idea of evolving not just the policy but the persuasive mechanism for its adoption is fresh and well-motivated. Empirically, the method convincingly outperforms a strong baseline (DSPy MiPROv2) on both the imitation and the collective-goal tasks (Table 1, p. 9). Overall, the paper sits at an interesting intersection of AI for social systems, mechanism design, and interpretability research.

### Weaknesses
The biggest concern is the narrowness of the experimental setup. All results come from a stylized five-farm synthetic landscape with simplified geometry and an overly discrete target metric (IIC), which makes it hard to judge real-world robustness. Even though ECHO beats the baseline, the absolute accuracies on global-target learning are low (0.13–0.31 across farms, Table 1, p. 9). It’s unclear if the learned heuristics are practically usable or just internally consistent. The use of LLM-simulated “Farm” agents to evaluate nudges is clever but questionable as a proxy for real human behavior, especially since the authors note that outcomes degrade substantially when swapping model families (Gemini 2.0 vs 1.5). Reproducibility across providers and prompts seems fragile. The complexity-performance trade-off (Fig. 3d, p. 7) also undercuts the claim that the method produces “simple, executable heuristics”; the best programs appear relatively opaque and brittle. Finally, some design choices, like mapping directional sets to fractional intervention values or relying on neighbor in-context examples, feel ad-hoc and would likely break under different spatial or economic assumptions.

### Questions
1. The framework currently optimizes for the Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC). How dependent are your results on this specific metric?

2. When discussing robustness, it’s unclear whether this refers to stability of learned heuristics under perturbations (e.g., small geometric or parameter changes) or resilience of the optimization loop itself.

### Summary
This work presents ECHO-MIMIC, an evolutionary algorithm-driven LLM framework that converts ill-structured problems into effective, well-structured problems. It leverages LLM optimizers with evolutionary algorithms to optimize code scripts per agent for optimizing their individual behaviors. The framework is studied in a simulation of an agricultural landscape and compared against a single prompt optimization baseline, where ECHO-MIMIC shows performance improvements in accuracy, discovering high-performing heuristics for individual agents.

### Strengths
1. This work studied a novel problem in agricultural landscape management, reflecting real-world impacts on resource management problems. 

2. The improvements over the MIPRO baseline are large, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework against general prompt optimization approaches.  

3. Using the code representation for controlling individual behavior provides a good optimization space given the current capability of large language model optimizers.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the agricultural landscape management provides a novel context for studying the ECHO-MIMIC approach, the research is also strongly limited to the domain of farm management. The system instructions and the optimizers are highly overfitted to this particular type of problem. Meanwhile, the human engineering of prompts can make the system brittle when the backbone LLM is transferred to another family of backbone. Therefore, the generalization of the proposed approach to other domains is understudied.

 2. The evolutionary algorithm part within the ECHO-MIMIC framework is not fundamentally different compared to earlier LLM-EA approaches (e.g., EvoPrompt), which limits the technical contribution of this work. 

3. Only a single baseline, MIPROv2, has been studied in this work. There are many other automatic multi-agent optimization frameworks that are worthy of comparison, such as AutoGen and G-Designer [1].

### Questions
