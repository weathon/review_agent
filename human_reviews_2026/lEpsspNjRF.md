# Beyond Geometry: Functionally Grounded Molecule Generation for Structure-Based Drug Design

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 2, 4

## Abstract
Structure-based drug design aims to generate 3D ligands that bind stably to specific protein pockets. While recent generative models have improved by incorporating the geometry of protein pockets, they still overlook the biochemical functional interactions between proteins and ligands. Crucial interactions include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and $\pi-\pi$ stacking, which are essential for binding affinity and structural stability. This oversight leads to strained, high-energy ligands that may geometrically fit but functionally misalign with the binding site. To bridge the gap, we introduce a Functionally Grounded Molecule Generation Network (FGMOL) that operates in a unified structure-function alignment framework, enabling molecular generation to align with protein-ligand interactions, extending beyond mere geometric fitting. Our design of \method introduces: (1) Interaction-Aware Embedding, which annotates protein atoms with explicit interaction types and feed them into SE(3)-equivariant neural networks; (2) Interaction-Informed Motif Alignment, which leverages differentiable clustering and Sinkhorn matching to align protein-ligand functional motifs; and (3) Interaction-Guided Generation with Bayesian Flow Network, which jointly models ligand coordinates and atom types via Bayesian updates in continuous space, conditioned on protein-guided cross-attention. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that \method surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods in binding affinity, and notably reduces strain energy by over 20%, while maintaining high synthetic accessibility—highlighting its advantage in interaction-aware ligand generation.

### Summary
This paper introduces FGMOL (Functionally Grounded Molecule Generation Network) for structure-based drug design (SBDD), arguing that current generative models overly focus on geometric fit while neglecting crucial biochemical functional interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, π-π stacking) between proteins and ligands. FGMOL aims to address this by integrating functional interactions into the generation process via a unified structure-function alignment framework. The method proposes three key components: 1) Interaction-Aware Embedding, which explicitly annotates protein atoms with interaction types and feeds them into SE(3)-equivariant networks; 2) Interaction-Informed Motif Alignment, using differentiable clustering and Sinkhorn matching to align protein-ligand functional motifs ; and 3) Interaction-Guided Generation using a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN), which models coordinates and atom types in continuous space conditioned on the alignment via cross-attention. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that FGMOL improves binding affinity, significantly reduces ligand strain energy (>20%) compared to SOTA methods, and maintains high synthetic accessibility.

### Strengths
- Explicitly encoding interaction types into protein atom features and processing them with SE(3)-equivariant networks provides a principled way to make the model aware of functional sites .

- The Interaction-Informed Motif Alignment step, using differentiable pooling to identify pharmacophore-like motifs and Sinkhorn normalization for alignment, introduces a valuable inductive bias for functional complementarity .

- Leveraging BFN for continuous generation guided by functional priors via cross-attention is a technically sound approach to promote physically plausible and functionally relevant structures .

### Weaknesses
- The paper seems to rely solely on atomwise features for added functional interactions. However, critical interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, are inherently pairwise features. This representation might be insufficient. Furthermore, the source of the 'function annotations' is unclear. Are these annotations extracted from the ground-truth ligand, or are they user-specified? If they are derived from the ground-truth ligand, this raises a significant concern about potential information leakage (or data leakage), where the model might be unfairly exposed to target information.
- The proposed model (FGMOL) incorporates several complex components, such as cross-attention and alignment mechanisms, and also utilizes all-atom modeling for the protein. Intuitively, these additions should introduce significant computational overhead. However, the paper claims that its sampling efficiency is merely 'similar' to MOLCRAFT. This finding is counterintuitive. Can the authors provide a more detailed breakdown or explanation for why these sophisticated components do not lead to a noticeable decrease in sampling efficiency compared to the MOLCRAFT baseline?

### Questions
- Could the authors elaborate on the source and method used for generating the functional interaction annotations? How sensitive is the model to the quality of these annotations and which functions contribute most?

### Summary
The authors present FGMol, a de novo ligand generation method. FGMol uses interaction-aware features and training to guide the generation process, yielding better results than traditional AI SBDD methods.

### Strengths
Paper is written well and easy to understand. Although adding additional features such as HBD, HBA, etc is not new, the BFN and matching of the ligand clusters and protein clusters is a good choice to model interactions between protein subpockets and ligand motifs.

### Weaknesses
While FGMol has the best docking scores and druglikeness metrics, it would be nice to see error bars. For example, D3FG appears to do only marginally worse than FGMol on Vina metrics (table 4). In addition, the SA and QED seem to be on par with other methods. Overall, while I appreciate the thoughtful design choices of the method, I’m not convinced of their efficacy compared to baselines.

### Questions
Could the authors elaborate on how the learned molecular motifs are different from existing work? Specifically, I believe DecompDiff does something similar (they call them ‘scaffolds’ in their paper), inferring motifs of a molecule and letting that guide the learning process.

Why are the results split into two tables? Specifically, tables 1 and 4. they appear to be showing the same metrics, why not combine them into 1 table? In addition, it looks like the baseline methods in the appendix (D3FG and IPDiff) are better than the baseline methods in the main text. IPDiff and D3FG are approaching the performance of FGMol; error bars showing statistical significance of results would be appreciated here.

### Summary
This submission explores the problem of structure-based drug design adopting a generative molecule model approach. The authors investigate two While most existing methods model only the geometry of the target protein and the ligand, the authors propose a method called FGMOL which also models the functional interactions between the two molecules. Domain knowledge about potential functions of atoms are integrated as priors into a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN). Experiments on the commonly used CrossDocked dataset were performed to compare FGML with several baselines, demonstrating gains in particular a higher proportion of high-affinity molecules.

### Strengths
Consideration of functional interactions promises to generate stronger and more stable interactions between protein and ligand.

Sampling in a continuous parameter space avoids the need of switching between continuous and discrete aspects of molecule representations.

Experiments were performed on the commonly used CrossDocked benchmark dataset.

### Weaknesses
Several related works have already explored interaction-guided approaches for structure-based drug design, including IPDiff (Huang et al., 2024b) and FLOWR (Cremer et al., 2025). The authors do not adequately differentiate their method from these existing methods.

Several aspects of the design of FGMOL are questionable:
-  It seems to me that interaction-aware features should be considered not only for the protein but also for the ligand.
- You state that you are also clustering ligand atoms based on similar interaction semantics, but that is not possible if you do not have interaction-aware features for ligands.
- Binding motifs could consist of interactions of multiple types, but FGMOL restricts clusters to groups of atoms with similar interaction semantics.

FGMOL lacks technical novelty since it îs largely a combination of existing methods, I.e. BFNs, SE(3)-equivariant NNs, the clustering method of Yang et al., 2018, the sampling approach of Qu et al., 2024.

The authors claim their cross-attention mechanism promotes "synthetically feasible" structures, but provide no evidence for this. The SA scores in Table 1 show only marginal improvements (0.70 vs 0.69 for MolCRAFT). They should benchmark using computational retrosynthesis tools like AiZynthFinder to actually demonstrate synthesizability. See Gao et al. (2024) "Reframing structure-based drug design model evaluation via metrics correlated to practical needs" for relevant discussion.

It is well known that docking scores and interaction counts correlate with molecular size - larger molecules naturally form more contacts and get better scores. The authors report improved Vina scores and interaction counts (Figure 3b-d, Figure 4) but do not control for molecule size. Without normalizing for molecule size, we do not know whether the docking score improvements are real or just due to generating larger molecules.

### Questions
1) What are the commonalities and the differences between FGMOL and Diff and FLOWR?

2) Do you really use interaction-aware features only for the protein? If so, why, and how can you then cluster ligand atoms with similar interaction semantics?

3) What is the ligand efficiency (LE = -Docking Score / HAC, where HAC = heavy atom count) of the compared methods?  See Hopkins et al. (2004) "Ligand efficiency: a useful metric for lead selection" Drug Discovery Today 9(10):430-431 and Kuntz et al. (1999) "The maximal affinity of ligands" PNAS 96(18):9997-10002.

### Summary
This paper presents a diffusion-based framework for learning functional protein–ligand representations that move beyond purely geometric modeling. The authors propose a unified latent diffusion model that conditions ligand generation on protein context, aiming to capture functional binding preferences rather than static spatial configurations. The work is conceptually relevant to the community’s shift from geometry-only to function-aware modeling. The integration of diffusion processes with binding-site features is promising and shows potential for future extensions in structure-based drug design.

Overall, the idea is novel and valuable, but the paper’s current form lacks comparative breadth, clarity of presentation, and some necessary experimental validation to convincingly support its claims.

### Strengths
1.	Timely problem formulation. The paper clearly recognizes the limitations of geometry-only paradigms (e.g., EquiBind, DiffDock) and attempts to incorporate more functional information. This is a meaningful and forward-looking direction for generative modeling in drug discovery.
2.	Methodological potential. The BFN-based conditioning strategy is technically sound, and the formulation seems general enough to extend to binding affinity prediction or multi-ligand environments.
3.	Qualitative promise: The generated ligand examples and the functional conditioning strategy suggest that the model may indeed be learning context-aware protein–ligand distributions, which could be impactful if verified on standard benchmarks.
4.	Conceptual clarity: The conceptual introduction and motivation are clearly stated, and the paper generally reads well from a methodological standpoint.

### Weaknesses
- Missing Comparisons with Relevant Baselines

While the paper claims to move “beyond geometry,” it omits comparison with several geometic-aware ligand generative methods that have already been evaluated in CBGBench or similar frameworks. DiffSBDD, DiffBP, VoxelBind, and GraphBP should be considered as references for assessing context-conditioned ligand generation. Without such baselines, it is unclear whether the proposed method outperforms or even matches these diffusion-based models on the same functional benchmarks. I strongly recommend evaluating on CBGBench, with more metrics against DiffSBDD/DiffBP.

- Weak Figure and Visual Presentation

Figure 2 is very difficult to interpret. The text is tiny, the schematic elements are disproportionately spaced, and large blank areas make it visually unbalanced. Readers cannot easily infer the data flow, diffusion/BFN steps, or conditioning mechanism from this figure. Given that this figure is central to the method, poor readability significantly undermines the perceived maturity and polish of the paper. I recommend redrawing it with consistent color coding for protein vs. ligand vs. latent variables, readable font (>8 pt in print), clear annotation of the process.

- Ambiguity in Feature Construction and Generation Consistency

The description of interaction embeddings is unclear. You mention that interaction types are represented as one-hot encodings and embedded as input features, but in most docking/complex datasets, such embeddings are computed by external software (e.g., PLIP or PyRosetta) — which requires both the protein and the ligand structures as input. 
That raises several questions:
	 1) During generation, the ligand does not yet exist — so what interaction embedding is used as input to the model?
	 2) If the embedding is a learned latent variable, how is it initialized or constrained?
	3) Is there a post-generation validation step that checks whether the predicted interactions correspond to physically meaningful patterns (H-bonds, π–π stacking, salt bridges, etc.)?

In previous work such as CBGBench, generated structures were re-scored using molecular interaction software to verify whether the distribution of recovered interactions matched experimental distributions. This paper does not include such an analysis, making it difficult to claim that the model indeed preserves functional interaction types or site-specific contact statistics. Or providing more visualization on certain diseases' targets to show that the generated molecules keep the preferred functional interactions of protein pockets.
