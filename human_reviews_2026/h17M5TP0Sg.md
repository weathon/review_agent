## Abstract
Large Language Model (LLM) inference presents substantial computational challenges when executed on commodity hardware, thereby necessitating the development of efficient acceleration techniques. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uniform compression strategies, they neglect the heterogeneous sensitivity patterns exhibited across different transformer layers. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Sparsity Allocation Framework (ASAF), a novel approach that integrates rotation-based low-bit quantization with layer-wise adaptive sparsity allocation. The framework comprises two sequential phases with dynamic programming strategy. Phase 1: coarse-grained optimization that determines the optimal number of layer groups and narrows sparsity rate search intervals. Phase 2: fine-grained optimization that determines precise consecutive layer allocation and exact sparsity rates within each group. The joint optimization of layer grouping decisions and sparsity rate assignments creates a combinatorial explosion in the solution space, rendering brute-force approaches computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we employ a dynamic programming strategy that efficiently decomposes the exponential search space into manageable subproblems across both phases, achieving practical computational efficiency while guaranteeing global optimality. Extensive experiments conducted on the Llama-2 model family reveal that our proposed framework sustains benchmark accuracy degradation within 1\%, concurrently achieving up to 3.63$\times$ prefill acceleration and 12.63\% memory reduction on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. This work advances beyond uniform compression strategies by recognizing and exploiting the distinct sensitivity characteristics of different transformer layers, thereby establishing a new paradigm for adaptive LLM compression on commodity hardware.

### Summary
This paper presents a method combining QuaRot quantization, SR-STE N:M semi-structured pruning, and model-guided search for exploring sparse N:M topologies. These techniques are combined to produce efficient and accurate LLMs from a pre-trained dense checkpoint. At W4A4 quantization, the proposed method is comparable to QuaRot in terms of accuracy and performance despite being sparse.

### Strengths
* Inference throughput is a crucial property to improve for practical LLM use cases. The proposed method improves prefill speeds by > 2x. 
* The accuracy degradation on QA tasks and PPL is small relative to QuaRot. 
* The proposed method combines several areas of prior work including random hadamard matrices for normalizing outlier activations, pruning approaches such as SR-STE, and model-based search with performance models.

### Weaknesses
# Major concerns
The following represent key weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the rating:
* Contradictory terminology: 2:4 sparsity is typically referred to as a “semi-structured” pruning method. Unstructured pruning describes the removal of weights without any particular pattern or underlying structure. As such “N:M unstructured” pruning is an oxymoron. 
* Co-adaptation?: The paper describes the challenges of combining quantization and pruning and the need to “coordinate the feedback loops between these two independent processes”. However, the proposed method is to sequentially quantize than prune, which doesn’t appear to satisfy the intent of providing feedback between the two processes. As such, the claim that the co-optimization problem has been solved appears to be overstated. 
* Limited novelty: As far as I can tell, each of the proposed steps in the compression method have been previously proposed. Quantization is performed with QuaRot, pruning is conducted with magnitude pruning, sparse fine-tuning uses SR-STE, and searching for the best layerwise N:M sparsity is conducted with typical surrogate-assisted optimization approach. As discussed in the incomplete literature review bullet below, the combination of these techniques has relatively limited novelty as well. 
* Memory reduction missing mask metadata: In Table 3 and appendix Table 1, N:M patterns at 50% sparsity are stated to have a x2 memory reduction. N:M sparsity requires storing $log_N(M)$ bits of mask metadata that does not appear to have been accounted for in these figures. In Appendix A.11.3, the authors note that the index overhead is negligible. For 2:4 sparsity with 4 bit weights, 3 bits of metadata are required for every two non-zero weights. This is an overhead of 31.25% which is not negligible. 
* Incomplete literature review: The investigation of combining sparsity and quantization for LLMs has seen some significant interest in recent years, but several important works are missing from the literature review. For instance, [1] found that sparsity and quantization cannot be defined as fundamentally orthogonal. [2] Explored joint sparsification and quantization including 2:4 sparsity and a variety of quantization and pruning methods. SDC [3] proposed a method of combining N:4 and N:8 pruning with W4A4 and W8A8 quantization, respectively. [4] investigated the pros and cons of quantization versus pruning including a small study on their combination when applied to computer vision models. [5] provided kernels intended for 2:4 W4A16 LLMs which achieve up to x5 acceleration even at batch size=1. It’s also worth noting that some of the papers which are cited already included ablations that combined sparsity and quantization. For example, SparseGPT experimented with that 4-bit weight quantization with 2:4 sparse weights and found only a 0.1 PPL increase above the 2:4 sparse BF16 baseline. This paper would be improved by citing works that have previously explored the combination of sparsity and quantization. In particular, adding concrete comparisons to other methods that combine sparsity and quantization is crucial to improving the paper's rating. 
* Limited performance gains: The performance gains of the proposed method are marginal compared to the speedups provided by just QuaRot alone. It’s unlikely that the small improvements in performance depicted in Figure 7 are worth the associated decreased accuracy compared to using QuaRot alone. 


# Minor concerns
The following are minor concerns, typos, etc. which would improve the work but do not affect the final rating: 
* L45: Including “this direction…” in the phrasing of the list elements is redundant. Suggest simply omitting and starting each element with the main clause (i.e., i) low-bit quantization, … ii) weight pruning, …
* L64: Weight pruning and quantization have been demonstrated to be non-orthogonal. [1]
* L98: “random dropout” typically refers to the dropout technique, which drops out neurons/units rather than individual connections/weights. Suggest rephrasing as 50% random pruning. 
* Figure 3A) is nearly identical to Figure 3 in QuaRot. Suggest removing and simply referring to the original work. 
* L142: Line spacing is non-uniform 
* L157: L_{pruned} is defined in the appendix but not the main body. 
* L161: Typo, $||\mathbf{W}\_i||_{20}$
* L248: Wrong in-text citation, should be for Zhou et al.: Learning N:M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch

### Questions
* How does the order of operations change your results? I.e., if pruning is conducted prior to quantization? [1] found prune-then-quantize to be the more optimal ordering.  
* How does the proposed method compare in terms of accuracy with SDC and JSQ? What about other method combinations such as Wanda+QuaRot or SparseGPT+QuaRot? These comparisons would help the reader better understand whether the proposed method offers improvements over existing literature.
* How does the speedup of the proposed method compare with Sparse Marlin kernels?

### Summary
The paper combines modern, rotation-based quantization with semi-structured sparsity in order to achieve further compresion and speedup over quantization alone.

### Strengths
As we are reaching the limits of speed-ups achievable by quantization alone, a combined quantized-sparse approach appears to be the next logical step.

### Weaknesses
The paper seems inconsistent in itself. First, it talks about unstructured pruning, but actually considers N:M structures (nowadays typically referred to a semi-structured sparsity). In fact, in the appendix, the paper itself states "Weight Storage Reduction. The N :M sparse matrix implementation significantly reduces memory requirements through structured sparsity"

Section 3.2 introduces block-wise magnitude-based pruning, but section 3.3 then talks about this being a (M, N) combinatorial problem.

> For matrix sparse multiplication, we adapt the dense matrix multiplication
implementation in the CUTLASS library (NVIDIA, 2023). This adaptation supports N:M sparse
pattern operations. More details can be found in Appendix A.7.

But I haven't found anything in the appendix about the actual fast N:M sparse matmul implementation; especially since N and M only allow one single fixed value if you want to use tensor core support, but the paper then claims to do a sweep over configurations (We evaluate N:M sparsity configurations where M ranges from 2 to 16 and N varies from 2 to 8)

I don't think the claim "where the index overhead for N :M patterns is negligible due to the regular structure." is true. With 2:4 sparsity, the overhead for indexing is 4 bits, (2 bits per non-zero), so at 4-bit quantization, this amounts to a total of 33% overhead, far from negligible. This only gets worse for larger M. 

Maybe I'm just missing something fundamental about this paper?

### Questions
How does the method proposed here compare against SparseMARLIN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11743v1)?

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified framework that combines rotation-based low-bit quantization with N:M structured sparsity to accelerate LLM inference on commodity GPUs. It introduces hardware-aware models to automatically find optimal sparse patterns and implements custom CUDA kernels for real speed gains. Tested on Llama-2 models, the approach delivers up to 3.65× faster inference and 50% lower memory use with under 1% accuracy loss.

### Strengths
- The paper argues that quantization and pruning, though individually mature, have rarely been co-optimized. This framing immediately positions the work as addressing a real and timely gap in LLM efficiency research.
- The authors provide formal mathematical descriptions for both rotation-based quantization and N:M sparsification, showing a good grasp of the underlying mechanics.
- Many papers stop at algorithmic contributions; this one goes further by grounding its optimization in actual GPU kernel behavior (CUTLASS, CUDA 12.1). The three-phase guided search—warm-up, model-construction, and model-guided exploration—is pragmatic and well justified.
- The paper is well-structured, It reads smoothly and keeps technical density manageable.

### Weaknesses
Areas for improvement:

- Most reported speedups are from the prefill stage, with less discussion about the decode stage performance. Since autoregressive decoding is often the true bottleneck, a deeper look at token-by-token latency improvements would make the results more compelling.
- The optimization search might be time-consuming for very large models, even with learned performance models. A clearer sense of total search cost (in GPU hours) versus achieved gains would help assess practicality.
- The paper compares mainly against QuaRot and GPTQ derivatives. Including results from SparseGPT or AWQ would have provided more baselines for the sparsity and quantization dimensions, respectively.
- It’s mentioned that the method achieves near-lossless performance with “minimal fine-tuning,” but concrete details (number of epochs, dataset size, compute cost) are buried in appendices. Bringing those front and center would enhance reproducibility.

### Questions
- You report strong prefill-stage speedups, but decoding often dominates real-world latency. Could you provide decode-stage results or discuss how the sparsity patterns affect token-by-token generation?
- How expensive is the N:M pattern search in practice? Please quantify the wall-clock or GPU-hour cost of the automatic scheduling process and discuss scalability for very large models.
- The paper claims “minimal fine-tuning.” Could you specify the number of epochs, dataset scale, and total compute cost to reproduce your reported <1% accuracy loss?
- Why were methods like SparseGPT or AWQ omitted in direct comparisons? Including them would clarify where your method stands relative to state-of-the-art pruning and quantization frameworks.
- How critical is the learned performance model versus random or heuristic search? An ablation showing the improvement from this component would strengthen your argument.
