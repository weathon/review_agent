## Abstract
We study online change point detection for multivariate inhomogeneous Poisson point process  data streams. Although this setting is common in applications such as earthquake seismology, climate monitoring, and epidemic surveillance, it  remains largely underexplored in the statistics and data science literature.   We propose a method that  uses   low-rank matrices  to represent the  multivariate Poisson intensity function, resulting in an adaptive procedure to detect local changes in a nonparametric setting. Our  algorithm processes the stream in a single-pass, and the per-observation cost is a constant independent of the elapsed stream length. We also provide theoretical guarantees to control  the overall false alarm probability and  quantify  the detection delay. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is statistically  robust and computationally efficient.

### Summary
This paper addresses online change point detection for multivariate inhomogeneous Poisson point process (MIPPP) streams—a setting common in earthquake seismology, climate monitoring, and epidemic surveillance but underexplored in literature.

The core idea is to represent the MIPPP intensity function using low-rank matrices (via orthonormal basis expansion, e.g., Legendre polynomials) to enable nonparametric, adaptive change detection. The proposed algorithm processes data in a single pass with per-observation cost constant (independent of stream length), ensuring computational efficiency.

Key Results: 
1.  A new online procedure for MIPPP change detection with linear total computational cost (scalable to long streams).

2.  Nonasymptotic bounds controlling (a) overall false alarm probability (≤α with high probability when no change occurs) and (b) detection delay (explicitly dependent on the \(L_2\)-norm jump \(\|\lambda^* - \lambda_a^*\|\) between pre- and post-change intensities).

3. (3D/4D MIPPP) and a real COVID-19 surveillance application (U.S. county-level cases) show the method outperforms baselines (Mean, MMD, KIE detectors) in reducing average detection delay (ADD) while maintaining low false alarm probability (FAP). For example, in strong-signal 3D settings, it achieves ADD≈17 (vs. 36 for Mean, 49 for KIE) with FAP≤0.3.

### Strengths
The paper demonstrates the originality by addressing a critical underexplored gap: online change point detection for multivariate inhomogeneous Poisson point process (MIPPP) streams.

The core innovation—using low-rank matrix representations (via orthonormal basis expansion, e.g., Legendre polynomials) to map continuous intensity functions to manageable matrices.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the applicability and generalizability. See detailed comments in "Questions" below.

### Questions
1. The problem considered in the paper is oversimplified setting, where only at most one change point is assumed.
2. In the training phase, all data are assumed to follow a common intensity independently. I think this is a very strong assumption in the following sense.
2.a   Data cannot be viewed independently. There exists a temporal dependence between COVID cases from different days.
2.b   It is also not good to assume the  COVID processes on different days follow the same intensity. We all know that the COVID cases are not stable processes. 
3. Apart from the real data (COVID-19) given in the paper, I wonder what other real data can be used in this paper? I feel like the number of real data can be applied here is limited.  

4. Can the authors provide more motivations on why we split x in R^d into two parts, y in R^p, and z in R^q?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of detecting changes in an observed stream of Poisson point processes, in an online setting. To the best of their knowledge, there is no method that reliably detects changes in the intensity function (their main quantity of interest) in the change point literature. They represent the multivariate Poisson intensity function using low-rank matrices and propose an adaptive procedure to detect local changes in a nonparametric setting. They control the false alarm probability and quantify the detection delay both theoretically and experimentally using synthetic and real data.

### Strengths
The paper shows originality in that the proposed method involves both new techniques and yields favourable estimators in some setting. The technique of representing the intensity function using low-rank matrices is new, and deviates from other related work which is concerned with the more general problem of detecting changes in nonparametric densities (as far as I understand). Hence the innovation seems to come from specifying the distribution change detection problem to that of Poisson point processes, and using this distribution’s parametric structure to come up with linear algebraic techniques for the problem. 

The presentation was reasonably clear. 

The theoretical results seem sound, and the experimental (synthetic) results are convincing that this is the best method for estimating change points in the quantity of interest. 

The work is significant. It experimentally improves over previous state of the art and admits a theoretical characterization which, once clarified, can make it a favourable method.

### Weaknesses
The innovation seems to come from specifying the problem to that of detecting the change in a specific distribution, and finding clever linear algebra representations that both produce a useful algorithm and a theoretical analysis. However, it is not surprising that designing a change point procedure for a distributional quantity that had not been studied before would yield better estimators. 

Beyond the low rank matrix representation of the intensity function, the techniques used are standard in online change point analysis.

The real data example has no comparison, it would be nice to see how your method performs against others in this scenario.

### Questions
- Consequences of Theorem 1: you mention that your theoretical detection delay improves over that of Madrid Padilla in the “non-trivial” setting where \kappa << 1. Why is this setting non-trivial? What happens when \kappa is of order 1 or greater, and why is this not important? Are you implying that your method only does better in the case of vanishing signal? If so, do you have any intuition why the nonparametric method does better outside of this case?
- Before Remark 2, you state that the singular values of D in (9) decay at the same rate. Do you prove this? How important is this for the theoretical result/algorithm to work?
- Experimental work: the simulation studies are good and comparisons seem fair, and I liked that you compared in the setting where \kappa is of order 1, even though your theory does not indicate superiority in this regime (according to my understanding). Did you consider comparing against other models, such as the Madrid Padilla one, in the real data example? I think that would strengthen the paper, since from the theoretical result it is not clear how much of an improvement your method gives over Madrid Padilla.

### Summary
This paper studies online change-point detection for multivariate inhomogeneous Poisson point process data streams. The authors propose a low-rank representation of the multivariate Poisson intensity function, enabling an adaptive and nonparametric detection framework. The method is theoretically supported with guarantees on false alarm probability and detection delay.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses an underexplored problem of online intensity change detection under nonparametric and high-dimensional settings.
- Both new algorithms and theoretical guarantees are provided.

### Weaknesses
- The problem setup is vague and is not sufficiently justified. And some related prior work on Poisson process detection appears to be missing.
- The detection Algorithms depend on unspecified constants $C_\alpha$ and $C_{lag}$, making practical use difficult.
- The COVID-19 example is not very ideal to demonstrate the method’s strengths, and results are missing. 
- The presentation could be significantly improved; the paper is difficult to follow in its current form.

### Questions
1. It should be made more clear in the problem setup what the meaning of streaming data is here. It seems the authors are assuming a series of point processes, not a stream of event data that is generated from a point process. If this is the case, then it should be mentioned how long each point process lasts, and does these point processes have any continuity in physical time. And it should be defined in the very beginning what is the format of each X^{(i)}. All these formulations need to be clarified to enhance the readability of the work. 

2. The algorithm 1 and algorithm 2 have limited usage if the constants $C_\alpha$ and $C_{lag}$ are not specified: the detection threshold $\tau$ depends on $C_\alpha$, while the window size required depends on $C_{lag}$. Therefore, it must be specified what these constants are, rather than saying “sufficiently large” in order for the algorithm to be practically usable. It is mentioned in Remark 4 that “Given these choices, we select the remaining parameters (r,W,Cα) in Algorithm 1 by cross-validation on the training data.” It should be specified how this cross-validation is performed, and comment on what will be the case if there is no training data available for cross-validation. 

3. The COVID dataset may not be an ideal real data example for this task, as the confirmed cases every day may have strong correlations, as there could be self-existing effects between confirmed cases, which makes it more meaningful to model the intensity function to be history dependent, such as a Hawkes model or an autoregressive model. Also, it is not clearly described how the authors convert the confirmed case data into Poisson processes. It seems to me that there should be a threshold such that the authors will mark an “event” in the location (long, lat) of the corresponding county if the confirmed cases in that county are above the threshold. And instead of presenting Figure 4, I think at least some kind of figures of the trajectory of the detection statistics should be presented to visualize the detection result; Figure 4 itself is not informative enough and is not helpful for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

4. Some related prior work seems to be missing, such as the following. And I think there should be more related works on detecting changes in Poisson processes.
