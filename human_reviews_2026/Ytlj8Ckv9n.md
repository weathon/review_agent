# Tracing the Traces: Latent Temporal Signals for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 2, 6, 6

## Abstract
Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time scaling, allocating more compute via longer and multiple token budgets. 
Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive thinking paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. 
We introduce _Latent-Trajectory_ signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. 
By analyzing both the extent and temporal course of latent representational change, as well as its alignment with the final state, we show that these signals are strong predictors of solution accuracy, outperforming conventional output-based confidence measures.
We use latent-trajectory signals to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, demonstrating that they make test-time scaling more effective and efficient, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy on average in comparison with majority voting. 
Finally, we show that these signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, which enables early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising answer candidates during generation.
Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

### Summary
In this work, the paper explores whether through intermediate activations we can identify chains of thought that are unlikely to lead to a correct answer and, if so, leverage these signals to guide the selection of more promising reasoning paths. They explore a number of signals, namely Net Change (measuring the overall magnitude of representational drift from initial to final hidden states), Cumulative Change (quantifying the total accumulated movement across intermediate updates), and Aligned Change (assessing how well sequential updates progress toward the final state via cosine similarity), and first investigate their correlation with accuracy. They find the signals can predict solution correctness across various science, math, and algorithmic benchmarks on several reasoning models, consistently outperforming baselines like cross-layer signals and output-distribution metrics. They use this to improve performance by guiding multi-sample inference through early answer selection and trace pruning, substantially reducing token usage while preserving or boosting accuracy on average over majority voting. The signals emerge early enough to allocate compute dynamically to promising paths.

### Strengths
1. **Training-Free Methodology**: The paper introduces Latent-Trajectory (LT) signals (Net Change, Cumulative Change, and Aligned Change) that leverage hidden states during reasoning without requiring additional training, annotations, or external models, making it highly practical for deployment across diverse LLMs.

2. **Superior Predictive Performance**: LT signals demonstrate robust discriminative power, achieving ROC-AUC scores of 0.71–0.74 for predicting solution accuracy across multiple datasets (GPQA, AIME 2025, TSP) and models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, Phi4-Reasoning-Plus, Qwen3-14B), consistently outperforming baselines like cross-layer signals and output-distribution metrics.

3. **Efficiency Gains in Inference Scaling**: By enabling early answer selection and trace pruning, LT signals reduce token usage by up to 70% in multi-sample inference, addressing key challenges in compute-intensive reasoning tasks like overthinking.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Heuristic Approach with Unproven Scalability**: The proposed Latent-Trajectory signals are fundamentally heuristic, derived from correlations observed in a narrow set of models. The evaluation is restricted to three models of a similar size from only two architectural families (Qwen and Phi). This lack of extensive analysis across different model types and, crucially, different model sizes (e.g., 7B, 70B, or larger) makes it unclear if these signals are a fundamental property of scaled reasoning or an emergent artifact of the specific models tested. Without this verification, there are significant questions about whether the method will "survive scaling" and generalize to future, more capable architectures.

2.  **Insufficient Discussion of Training Alternatives**: The work positions itself as a necessary inference-time intervention without adequately addressing why modern training methods, such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO-style approaches), are not already solving this problem. A key question left unanswered is why models cannot be trained to inherently favor productive reasoning strategies, which would be a more robust and fundamental solution than applying a post-hoc heuristic. This omission weakens the justification for needing such an inference-time fix.

3.  **Narrow Domain Scope**: The experiments are confined to three specific and relatively structured reasoning domains: scientific multiple-choice (GPQA), contest math (AIME 2025), and algorithmic optimization (TSP). The paper does not evaluate the signals on more diverse or open-ended tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, creative problem-solving, or multi-hop question answering over text. This narrow scope limits the claim that LT signals are a general-purpose tool for assessing reasoning quality across the broad spectrum of tasks LLMs are applied to.

### Questions
1. **Comparison to Reinforcement Learning Training**: Why pursue this inference-time heuristic approach using Latent-Trajectory signals when reinforcement learning methods like GRPO could directly train models to favor productive reasoning paths during optimization, potentially eliminating unproductive traces without the need for handcrafted, post-training interventions that may not generalize across diverse architectures?

2. **Causal Interpretability**: While LT signals correlate with accuracy, do they reveal causal mechanisms in reasoning (e.g., via interventions on hidden states), or are they just correlated signals?

3. What evidence is there that such trace signals will generalise to other model classes and sizes and on different problems

### Summary
The paper proposes novel methods for evaluating the reasoning chains of language models. The chain is split into segments of length 500. For each layer, the mean hidden state of these segments is calculated. The paper suggests three measures: (1) *net change* is the L2 norm of the difference between the hidden vectors of the first and the last segment; (2) *cumulative change* is the sum of the L2 norms of the differences between consecutive hidden vectors ; and (3) *aligned change* is the average cosine similarity between each segment's update vector and the overall trend of the reasoning chain. For all measures, the mean across all layers is used to get a single scalar score. It is shown that high *net change* and high *aligned change* are associated with correct reasoning, whereas high *cumulative change* is associated with incorrect reasoning. These correlations are stronger than previously proposed measures. The paper shows how this allows for better selection between several alternative reasoning chains and even early selection of promising reasoning paths, leading to higher accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths
- Clear description of the method: The paper clearly outlines the three Latent-Trajectory signals and how they are computed .
- Thorough experimental evaluation: The method is tested across multiple modern reasoning models and three distinct domains (science, math, and algorithmic problems), demonstrating robust findings .
- Immediately useful and practical results: The paper demonstrates that the proposed method can improve both the accuracy and efficiency of reasoning models. A practical advantage is that the method is training-free, it does not require costly annotations or the training of additional verifier models, making it simple to implement.

### Weaknesses
The proposed methods for improving performance and efficiency need some parameter tuning (e.g., threshold calibration). The segment size over which the averaged hidden states are computed is fixed at 500 (a segment size of 300 was also tested ). More fine-grained tracking of the hidden states might be insightful.

These are only minor concerns, which lead to my current vote of weak accept. If my questions below are addressed, I would consider further increasing my score.

### Questions
- Lines 340-353: Is the cross-validation to select the threshold done separately for each benchmark (GPQA, AIME2025, TSP), or is the same threshold used for all benchmarks? The more meaningful and fair setting in my mind would be one where a global threshold would be chosen for a model and then used for all reasoning problems.
- It makes intuitive sense that for many kinds of reasoning problems, a 'direct' or linear route through the latent space is desirable. However, other problems—particularly ones that require novel out-of-the-box solutions, lots of trial and error, divergent instead of convergent thinking —might benefit from less direct traces. How broad is the class of problems for which the presented results hold?
- More of a comment: the authors might be interested in recent work analysing the hidden states of language models using, for example, the lens of prompt entropy ("Layer by Layer: Uncovering Hidden Representations in Language Models", Skean et al., 2025) or information gain ("Measuring In-Context Computation Complexity via Hidden State Prediction", Herrmann et al., 2025).

### Summary
This paper introduces a method for predicting the correctness of a reasoning path by analyzing the direction and magnitude of change in latent vectors over the temporal dimension. The goal is to infer the quality of a reasoning path in advance by examining its latent dynamics during the intermediate generation process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Latent-Trajectory (LT) signals correlate with final answer accuracy. Furthermore, the paper shows that these LT signals can be practically applied for early answer selection and path pruning, significantly reducing the number of tokens generated while maintaining, and in some cases improving, overall accuracy.

### Strengths
1. Training-free method: The core method is training-free and does not rely on semantic understanding. It provides a novel way to discriminate reasoning quality based purely on the internal dynamics of the model's hidden states, making it a lightweight and potentially generalizable approach.

2. Positive experimental results: The experiments successfully show a positive correlation between the proposed LT signals and final answer accuracy. More importantly, the paper demonstrates the practical utility of these signals in two efficiency-oriented applications (Early Answer Selection and Early Path Selection), achieving notable reductions in number of tokens while preserving or even slightly improving accuracy .

3. Novel methodological perspective: The central idea of analyzing the temporal evolution of latent states is a novel contribution. It offers a new lens for understanding the reasoning process.

### Weaknesses
1. Moderate correlation and robustness: The reported correlations (Spearman's r in Table 3) are moderate, often falling in the 0.3-0.7 range. While the authors show this is sufficient for the tested datasets, this moderate correlation suggests the signal is somewhat noisy and raises concerns about the method's robustness when applied to different models, domains, or tasks.

2. Heavy reliance on unjustified hyperparameters: The methodology is built on several ad-hoc, empirical settings that lack strong theoretical or intuitive justification. For example, segmentation (k=500), averaging (across-layer), or checkpoint (t=2000) in early pruning experiment. This work does not provide a guide on how to set this parameters when applied to other tasks.

3. Missing Comparison to Key Related Work: A critical weakness is the lack of experimental comparison to highly relevant, concurrent work. Specifically, the paper does not compare ST-BoN [1], which shares an identical motivation (efficient Best-of-N) but uses a competing approach (spatial/layer-wise trajectory analysis). Given the strong overlap in goals, a direct comparison is necessary to properly situate this work's contribution.

4. Inefficient experimental setup for Early Selection: The "Early Answer Selection" experiment relies on a serial generation strategy (generating samples one by one). This approach discards the parallel processing capabilities of modern inference infrastructure (i.e., batch decoding) and is likely highly inefficient in real-world applications.

### Questions
1. For the "Early Answer Selection" experiment, how does the LT signal-based stopping rule compare to simpler serial baselines? For instance, what is the accuracy if one simply stops after the first sample (k=1) or the second (k=2)? A key concern is that the tested datasets might have low output variance, and a simple k=1 or k=2 rule might achieve similar results without the complexity of calculating LT signals.

2. The method's reliance on calibration on a labeled (correct/incorrect) dataset seems to limit its application. How do the authors envision this method being practiced in more general, open-ended scenarios (e.g., creative writing, general instruction-following) where there is no single ground truth and "correct/incorrect" labels for calibration are unavailable?
