## Abstract
Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected‐device networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional, fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO}---\emph{Federated Asynchronous Network Orchestrator}---a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor–critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym} environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency, underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

### Summary
This paper presents a semi-asynchronous FRL framework tailored for decentralized Task Offloading (TO) in dynamic edge computing systems. The framework models the TO problem as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POMG).

### Strengths
The paper presents a novel adaptation of buffered semi-asynchronous FRL for edge task offloading. This design effectively mitigates straggler effects and enhances sample efficiency, which is critical in heterogeneous edge environments.
The federated critic / local actor architecture is well-constructed, balancing global coordination with local autonomy. It respects partial observability and improves robustness against node heterogeneity.

### Weaknesses
1. Single Point of Failure: The framework relies on a centralized global critic, which could become a bottleneck or a single point of failure in real-world deployments. A decentralized or hierarchical critic design might improve robustness.

2. Lack of Real-World Experiments: All evaluations are conducted in simulation (PeersimGym), which may not capture real-world complexities. Real-world experiments or deployment on testbeds would significantly strengthen the paper.

### Questions
How would FAuNO perform in scenarios with adversarial or unreliable nodes? Is there any mechanism to detect or mitigate poisoned updates?

### Summary
This paper proposes FAuNO, a semi-asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework for task offloading in edge systems.
The main idea is to extend FedBuff-style buffered asynchronous aggregation into an actor–critic setup: local agents train PPO-based actors, while a Global Manager (GM) asynchronously aggregates critic updates from clients.
The goal is to deal with stragglers and heterogeneity in edge systems by allowing faster nodes to contribute more frequently without blocking others.
The authors evaluate FAuNO in the PeersimGym simulator on two types of topologies (Ether-like clustered and random networks).
They compare against a simple heuristic (Least Queue) and a reimplemented synchronous federated RL baseline (SCOF).
They also include ablations on heterogeneity, packet-drop rates, and buffer-size thresholds.
Overall, FAuNO shows improvements over baselines in most scenarios, though performance depends on network topology.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses an important practical problem (handling stragglers in federated edge RL) with a sensible approach combining buffered asynchronous aggregation and actor-critic MARL.
- The presentation is generally clear, with helpful visualizations (Fig. 2) and a logical flow from problem formulation to experiments.
- The experimental evaluation includes multiple network topologies (Ether-based and random), ablations on buffer size (Table 8) and packet drops, and a heterogeneity analysis (Section 6.1).
- The authors transparently acknowledge current limitations (lines 471-485, 756-760), including the single global manager bottleneck and topology-specific reward tuning.
- The PeersimGym extension (Section 7) to support federated update exchange is a useful engineering contribution.

### Weaknesses
While FAuNO is cleanly implemented and well-motivated, a few important weaknesses keep it from being fully convincing in its current form:
1. Mathematical inconsistencies and unclear formulations.
   Several of the paper's core equations need revision or clarification:
   * The communication delay formula (Eq. 1) mixes logarithms with dB values, which gives units of bits/Hz rather than seconds. This should be fixed using $T = \frac{\alpha}{B \log_2(1+\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}})}$. Using natural log gives wrong capacity units.
   * The reward function (Eq. 9) adds delay as a *positive* term, which reverses the expected reward logic.
   * The global objective (Eq. 10) minimizes over critic weights $w$ even though $l_k(w, \theta_k)$ depends on both local and global parameters. The text should explain the alternating optimization scheme more clearly.
   * The advantage estimation (Eq. 20) is labeled as GAE, but it's actually an n-step formulation without λ. This is minor but worth correcting.
2. Narrow set of baselines.
   The comparisons include only LQ and SCOF. These are decent but relatively weak. Adding comparisons with more modern federated or asynchronous RL baselines (e.g., FedAsync, FedProx, MAPPO) would give a clearer sense of where FAuNO stands.
3. Reward shaping limits generalizability (though authors acknowledge this).
    The authors transparently admit that their reward function is "tailored to mitigate congestion in star-like Ether topologies" and "biases FAuNO toward local processing" in random networks. While this honesty is appreciated, it reveals a practical limitation: FAuNO's performance is sensitive to topology-specific reward tuning. In random topologies, LQ outperforms FAuNO on task completion (Table 5) precisely because the reward discourages offloading even when the network structure supports it. This suggests FAuNO may require manual reward retuning for each deployment scenario, limiting its plug-and-play applicability. Testing alternative reward formulations or learning adaptive reward weights would strengthen the generalizability claims.
4. Constraint vs. RL mismatch.
   The paper begins by framing the task offloading problem as a constrained optimization (Eqs. 6–8) but never enforces these constraints. In practice, FAuNO turns them into soft penalties in the reward. This is fine, but it should be clearly stated that the hard-constraint formulation is relaxed.
5. Observation normalization.
   Using −1 to represent missing neighbors while normalizing other inputs to [0, 1] is questionable. It's not serious, but a masking or zero-padding strategy would be better i think.
6. Reproducibility problem – repository link is empty.
   The paper provides an anonymous code link (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FAuNO-C976) but the repository is empty and contains no runnable scripts. While the appendix includes detailed hyperparameters, the lack of working code prevents independent verification of results.

### Questions
1. Concerning Eq. 9, was the delay term negated during implementation (making a longer delay lead to less reward)?
 
2. In Eq. 10, when minimizing over the critic weights w, do you hold the actor parameters $\theta_k$ fixed?
 
3. How does FAuNO's performance change as the buffer threshold $K$ increases beyond 0.5?
 
4. Could the global critic aggregation be made hierarchical or fully decentralized?
 
5. The clip parameter in PPO is set to $\varepsilon = 0.5$, which is substantially greater than typical values (0.1–0.2). Was this for stability purposes?

### Summary
This paper addresses decentralized task offloading in edge computing, proposing FAuNO under conditions of limited observability and communication constraints. Specifically, each node trains its actors locally using PPO, while only performing federated semi-asynchronous buffering aggregation of critics across nodes, allowing faster nodes to participate more frequently and preventing slower nodes from being blocked. Empirical evaluation shows that FAuNO out performs or matches FRL and heuristic baselines in terms of task completion time and task completion.

### Strengths
1.FedBuff's "buffered semi-asynchronous" concept is introduced into federated reinforcement learning, and only the critic is federated, taking into account both personalization and sample efficiency. The engineering implementation is complete and open source.
2.The article also performs communication-level event simulation on PeersimGym, which more closely resembles real-world edge links.

### Weaknesses
1.Insufficient theoretical analysis. The paper models task offloading as POMG and proposes a framework of "actor local, critic federation, and semi-asynchronous buffer aggregation." However, it lacks convergence or upper bounds on error under semi-asynchronous and staleness conditions. It also fails to analyze the estimation bias of federated critics under non-IID or distribution drift conditions.
2.Ablation depth. Since the core claim hinges on critic-only federation + semi-async, include ablations for (i) federating both actor+critic, (ii) actor-only, and (iii) purely synchronous critic aggregation to isolate where gains originate.

### Questions
1.What happens if paper also federate the actor (or federate neither)? Does critic-only federation still dominate?

### Summary
This paper propose FAuNO, a task offloading framework integrates buffered semi-asynchronous aggregation with PPO in edge systems. FAuNO enables agents to learn the task offloading policies under heterogeneous conditions. The experiments shows that FAuNO outperforms the heuristic and FRL-based baselines in terms of task completion time and task completion.

### Strengths
1.  This paper provides a detailed review in Background & Related Work.
2.  This paper presents a comprehensive process for building system model.

### Weaknesses
1.The description of the global component requires improvement. The relationship between Eq.11 and Eq.12 is unclear, and their connection to Figure 2 lacks detailed explanation.
2.The description in Fig. 2 is redundant and confusing, unable to convey the paper's idea.
3.The method proposed in this paper mostly relies on combining existing approaches (the PPO algorithm and FedBuff), which lacks innovation.
4.The paper has limited baselines for comparison, only one heuristic method and one FRL -based approach. The proposed method appears to be a straightforward FRL implementation. It is suggested to increase the number of FRL-based baselines and provide a more in-depth explanation of the advantages of the proposed method in the performance evaluation.
5.The specific definitions and descriptions of Variant in Tables 6 and 7 are unclear.

### Questions
1.What are the differences between Formula 11 and Formula 12, and which subgraphs in Figure 2 do they correspond to respectively?
2.What is the specific meaning of “Variant” in Tables 6 and 7? For example, FAuNO vs. FAuNO and Pure MARL vs. Pure MARL.
