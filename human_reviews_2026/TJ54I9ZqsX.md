## Abstract
Modeling 3D dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in the physical and engineering sciences, where Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm by incorporating geometric symmetries. However, these models are fundamentally constrained by their discrete-time, Markovian framework, which neglects long-range temporal correlations and inevitably leads to error accumulation in long-horizon forecasting. To address this limitation, we introduce the Equivariant Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (EG-NODE), a novel framework that directly learns the continuous-time evolution laws of physical systems. Instead of predicting discrete future states, EG-NODE leverages an equivariant GNN as its core to directly model the ordinary differential equation governing the system’s instantaneous rate of change the physical laws of motion thereby natively preserving SE(3) symmetry within the learning process. This continuous-time paradigm enables high-precision predictions at arbitrary time points and allows for the use of adaptive step-size solvers to dynamically balance computational efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on N-body, molecular, and fluid dynamics benchmarks demonstrate that EG-NODE significantly outperforms existing discrete models in long-horizon prediction accuracy and effectively suppresses error propagation. Our work establishes a more fundamental, first-principles-based paradigm for learning continuous physical laws from data.

### Summary
This work presents a method to mitigate error accumulation in physical system simulations using deep learning. The approach combines three key components: (1) a message-passing graph neural network (GNN), (2) equivariant engineered features derived from particle positions and velocities, and (3) a Neural-ODE–like integration scheme that enables the model to learn a continuous-time representation without relying on an explicit time step. The motivation is to alleviate the error accumulation typical of discrete integrators such as Euler methods, while reducing data requirements and improving generalization through the use of equivariances. The method is evaluated on three benchmark problems: N-body dynamics, molecular dynamics, and fluid dynamics, demonstrating superior rollout predictions compared to existing approaches. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each component.

### Strengths
* The examples and analysis of the results are strong. The method is tested over three very different datasets.
* The authors provide multiple ablation studies justifying the final architecture.
* The analysis over sparse and irregular data is interesting.
* The paper is very clear and well written.

### Weaknesses
* The paper offers only a modest contribution. The proposed GNN closely follows the design of "E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks" (Satorras et al., 2022), and the Neural-ODE component is implemented using the standard adjoint method introduced in "Neural Ordinary Differential Equations" (Chen et al., 2018). Moreover, several prior works have already explored the integration of NeuralODEs with non-equivariant GNNs. Consequently, the main novelty of this paper lies primarily in the use of equivariant GNNs, rather than in the combination of NeuralODEs and GNNs itself (see Questions for more information).
* Even though the code is available, the paper lacks any details about the datasets used.

### Questions
* Line 137: While it may indeed be the first attempt to combine NeuralODEs with equivariant GNNs, there already exists a substantial body of work integrating NeuralODEs with non-equivariant GNNs, which the authors overlook in the literature review. E.g. "Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations" (Poli et al 2019), "HOPE:High-order Graph ODE For Modeling Interacting Dynamics" (Luo et al 2023), "TANGO: Time-Reversal Latent GraphODE for Multi-Agent Dynamical Systems" (Huang et al 2023).
* Equation 3: What is the motivation of selecting the third invariant edge feature? It is a scaled version of the second edge feature, so this might reduce its expressivity. Why not selecting another rotation and translation invariant feature which might encode richer information, such as $||v_i-v_j||_2$?
* Section 4.1: For reproducibility, it would be convenient to include an appendix of additional dataset details, such as train/test size, number of snapshots, simulation parameters, et, even if they are common benchmarks. Also, what is the scalar feature vector on each case (mass, density)? 
* Code: The Experiment_code comments are in Chinese. It would be helpful for the interested reader to translate them to English.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of modeling 3D dynamical systems using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs), which are limited by their discrete-time, Markovian nature and prone to long-horizon error accumulation. To overcome this, the authors propose EG-NODE, a framework that combines EGNNs with Neural ODEs to learn the continuous-time evolution of physical systems while preserving SE(3) symmetries. Experiments on N-body, molecular, and fluid dynamics benchmarks show that EG-NODE outperforms existing discrete-time models in long-horizon forecasting and effectively reduces error propagation.

### Strengths
1.The paper is well written and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the methodology and results.
2.The paper includes a comprehensive ablation study that effectively demonstrates the impact of each component in the model architecture.

### Weaknesses
1.The proposed method appears to be a straightforward combination of EGNN and Neural ODEs, which limits the level of novelty.

2.Although the paper claims to compare with a comprehensive set of baselines, several strong and highly relevant equivariant competitors are missing, including Radial Field flows [1], GMN [2], and SEGNO [3]. These methods represent competitive state-of-the-art techniques and should be included for a fair performance comparison.

3.The settings for prediction horizons and temporal windows are not clearly described in the experimental section. Moreover, the paper states that core hyperparameters are kept consistent across models “to ensure a fair comparison,” but this is insufficient. Achieving strong baseline performance requires proper hyperparameter tuning for each method. Comparable tuning effort should be applied to the baselines, similar to the detailed parameter sensitivity analysis conducted for the proposed model.

### Summary
This paper introduces EG-MODE, a framework that integrates equivariant GNNs with Neural ODEs to learn the continuous-time dynamics of physical systems. Its key contribution is learning the underlying ODE directly, which inherently preserves SE(3) symmetry and effectively mitigates error accumulation in long-term predictions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

### Strengths
1. EG-MODE reduces long-term prediction error by modeling continuous-time dynamics instead of discrete steps, effectively suppressing error accumulation.

2. It inherently preserves SE(3) symmetry through an equivariant GNN, ensuring physical consistency and better generalization across reference frames.

3. The framework enables flexible and efficient simulation at arbitrary time points using adaptive ODE solvers, improving both accuracy and computational adaptability.

### Weaknesses
1. In N-body dynamics prediction tasks, the number of particles N is a significant parameter, yet there is a lack of experimental analysis across different values of N in the paper.

2. The paper lacks a critical analysis of the limitations of the proposed method and its scope of application.

3. The manuscript contains several typographical errors and imprecise statements. For instance, in Section 3.2, the reference "Eq. equation 2" is non-standard, and the term f_θ(z(t)) is used imprecisely, as it is not solely a function of a.

### Questions
1. Many systems do not satisfy SE(3) equivariance, or only partially satisfy it, such as those involving external fields or fixed boundaries. What are the prospects for extending this method to such scenarios?

2. The authors deliberately engineered some simple equivariant terms (e.g., Equation (3)), and all subsequent, powerful equivariant updates (such as coordinate updates) rely on these initial, invariant edge features. Therefore, the expressive power of these edge features is a crucial issue, and may even represent a potential bottleneck for the overall effectiveness of the method.

3. See weaknesses.

If the authors can adequately address these points, I would be prepared to raise my score.
