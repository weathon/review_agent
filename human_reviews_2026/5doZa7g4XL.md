## Abstract
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

### Summary
This paper introduces **Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL)**, a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to address the persistent **exploration bottleneck** in using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for general Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning tasks. The core problem is that RL improvement requires learning from high-quality samples, but the LLMs' inherent limitations restrict their ability to explore and find new, high-quality samples, leading to an undesirable cycle where what cannot be explored cannot be learned.

RuscaRL leverages **checklist-style rubrics** in two complementary ways:

1.  **Explicit Scaffolding for Exploration:** During the rollout generation phase, rubrics are incorporated as external guidance within task instructions to steer the model towards diverse and high-quality responses. This scaffolding is managed through a two-dimensional control mechanism:
    *   **Intra-Group Scaffolding Differentiation:** Assigns varying levels of rubric criteria to responses within the same sampling group (e.g., using the linear differentiation pattern $\lambda_i = \frac{G-i}{G-1}$) to encourage diversity and guided exploration.
    *   **Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay:** Gradually withdraws the guidance over training steps using a Sigmoid function ($\lambda_{step}(t)$) to encourage the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns and minimize reliance on external cues.
2.  **Verifiable Rewards for Exploitation:** Rubrics serve as references for robust LLM-as-a-Judge reward calculation. A Grader LLM performs a binary evaluation ($b_i \in \{0, 1\}$) on each specific criterion $c_i$. The final scalar reward $r_i$ is derived by aggregating these scores and normalizing by the total possible score.

**Key Contributions and Results:** RuscaRL demonstrates superior performance across various benchmarks spanning medical, writing, instruction following, and STEM domains. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts the performance of **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on HealthBench-500 from 23.6 to 50.3**, surpassing GPT-4.1 (47.9). The fine-tuned Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct model achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs like OpenAI-o3 (59.8). Analysis shows RuscaRL improves sampling efficiency, expands the reasoning boundary (at large Best-of-N settings), and generates highly **novel responses** that the initial model could barely generate.

### Strengths
**Originality:** The paper pioneers the introduction of **instructional scaffolding theory** (derived from educational psychology, like Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development) into the RLVR paradigm for LLMs. The dual mechanisms of Intra-Group Scaffolding Differentiation and Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay are a highly creative combination designed explicitly to promote high-quality diversity during exploration while ensuring eventual internalization and convergence.

**Quality:** The robustness of the method is confirmed through extensive experimentation across a wide range of tasks and model scales (Qwen, Llama, Instruct, and Base models). The ablation studies rigorously validate the core design choices, showing the **linear differentiation strategy** and the **Sigmoid decay function** are empirically optimal for intra-group and inter-step control, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of policy entropy demonstrates that RuscaRL achieves a better **exploration-exploitation balance** compared to baselines, avoiding premature entropy collapse or uncontrolled instability.

**Clarity:** The methodology is sharply defined, detailing how rubrics are used both for explicit prompting (scaffolding ratio $\lambda_S$) and for robust reward computation (binary grading and aggregation). The training configuration, hyperparameter settings, and prompt templates (Grader, Scaffolding, Data Generation) are provided in the Appendix, which significantly enhances the study's **reproducibility**.

**Significance:** RuscaRL successfully tackles a fundamental challenge in applying RL to general LLM reasoning: the exploration bottleneck. By enabling smaller, open-source models (like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) to match or exceed the performance of much larger or closed-source models (like GPT-4.1 and OpenAI-o3) on difficult benchmarks, the framework demonstrates substantial practical significance for advancing open-source LLM capabilities.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Critical Dependency on Rubric Quality and Scarcity:** The authors acknowledge that RuscaRL **critically relies on high-quality, well-structured rubric datasets**, which are currently scarce in the community. The framework is highly sensitive to rubric design quality; poorly designed rubrics (e.g., those with unreasonable point allocations or conflicting criteria) may fail to provide robust reward signals, and narrow rubrics can restrict the generation of diverse, high-quality responses. This dependency poses a practical limitation for applying RuscaRL widely to new domains without substantial prior effort in rubric creation.

2.  **Sensitivity to Decay Hyperparameters:** The crucial Inter-Step Scaffolding Decay mechanism using the Sigmoid function is highly sensitive to the hyperparameters $\alpha$ (steepness) and $t_0$ (midpoint). The ablation study shows that small variations in these parameters can lead to significantly degraded performance (e.g., preventing model adaptation, causing training instability, or inducing overfitting due to over-reliance on external guidance). This suggests that RuscaRL requires meticulous tuning when applied to new tasks or different model architectures to find the optimal decay curve.

3.  **Efficiency and Cost of Reward Calculation:** The reward computation phase necessitates the use of a Grader LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B or GPT-4.1) for binary evaluation of $N$ criteria per response, across $G$ responses per step. The reported average Reward time of 20 seconds per step, based on external API usage, highlights a potentially significant computational and monetary overhead compared to the Rollout (40 seconds) and Actor Update (15 seconds) stages. The work does not provide a clear estimate of the internal computational cost (e.g., GPU hours, latency) if the Grader LLM were deployed self-hosted, making the framework's overall efficiency profile unclear for self-contained, large-scale training.

4.  **Incomplete Explanation for SFT Superiority in Specific Domains:** While RuscaRL generally outperforms baselines, for the **WritingBench** task (using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) achieved a larger gain (+17.5) than RuscaRL (+11.0) in the direct setting. Although the authors provide reasoning for the narrowing gap in the SFT-then-RL scenario (overlap in exploration facilitation), a deeper analysis is needed to explain why SFT, based on static GPT-4.1 demonstrations, provided a stronger initial structural foundation for this specific creative task than the dynamic, rubric-based scaffolding provided by RuscaRL.

### Questions
1.  **Quantifying Rubric Noise Robustness:** The paper identifies the critical dependence on high-quality rubrics as a limitation. To inform practical application, could the authors conduct an additional analysis quantifying RuscaRL's resilience? Specifically, how does performance change if the rubrics are deliberately perturbed—for example, by inverting points for a fraction of criteria, or by including criteria that are ambiguous or contradictory? This would establish the framework's robustness against real-world "rubric noise."

2.  **Direct Measurement of Scaffolding Internalization:** The inter-step decay mechanism is designed to encourage the model to internalize reasoning patterns. A direct measure of internalization would be to check if the final policy $\pi_{\theta}$ can generate high-quality responses without the explicit rubric cues. Could the authors compare the statistical similarity (e.g., KL divergence or semantic distance) between generations sampled using the final policy *with* scaffolding ($\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|q, R_S)$) versus *without* scaffolding ($\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|q)$)? If internalization is complete, these distributions should be highly similar for high-scoring responses.

3.  **Grader LLM Efficiency and Alternatives for Deployment:** The Reward computation phase adds 20 seconds per step when using external APIs, which is substantial. If the authors used the Qwen3-32B model as the Grader, what is the internal, self-hosted operational cost (e.g., GPU memory usage and latency per evaluation for a typical rubric size)? Furthermore, have the authors explored cost-saving alternatives, such as distilling the knowledge of the Grader LLM into a smaller, faster verifier model, or using a self-training loop to create a low-cost, domain-specific Grader?

4.  **Impact of Maximal Scaffolding on Novelty:** The linear differentiation strategy provides maximal scaffolding ($\lambda_i=1$) to the first sample in each group. While this promotes exploration guided by criteria, does maximum scaffolding ever suppress the emergence of truly novel solutions that do not strictly adhere to the checklist structure? Could the authors analyze whether the highest novelty responses (those with extremely high importance ratios, $\rho_{seq} > 100$) tend to be generated by samples with maximal scaffolding, or instead by those with lower, more moderate scaffolding ratios?

### Summary
The paper proposes Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), aiming to address the exploration bottleneck in open-ended domains for RLVR. It integrates rubric-based external guidance directly into task instructions, creating a controllable exploration schedule. The method is evaluated across multiple open-ended benchmarks (e.g., HealthBench, writing, instruction-following) and multiple models, showing consistent performance gains.

### Strengths
1. Motivation is clear and reasonable: the paper directly targets the exploration bottleneck of RLVR in open-ended domains by integrating external guidance into task instructions to improve rollout diversity and quality, enabling controllable, scheduled exploration via rubric scaffolds.

2. Strong empirical evidence: across multiple models and diverse tasks, the method consistently outperforms strong baselines, including Rubric-based RL.

3. Insightful ablations on scaffolding: the ablation studies systematically examine when and how to apply scaffolds, offering practical guidance for maximizing exploration benefits.

### Weaknesses
1. Baseline collapse issue (Figure 5): The Rubric-based RL baseline appears to collapse around 200 training steps, with entropy exploding, which raises concerns about the validity of the comparison. It is unclear whether this collapse is caused by non-robust experimental settings or run-specific instability, or whether it reflects an intrinsic weakness of the baseline. Since RuscaRL’s main gains only emerge after 200 steps (with no obvious improvements before that point in Fig. 5b), a substantial portion of the reported improvement might be due to baseline failure rather than method superiority.

    Given that Rubric-based RL is the most crucial baseline, there should be at least one comparison run where the baseline does not collapse to demonstrate that the improvement is robust to make the main claim convincing. Alternatively, the authors should provide a thorough explanation for the baseline collapse. 

2. Novelty concerns: The idea of adding external guidance or scaffolding in RL is not entirely new—e.g., similar concepts appear in prior work such as [1]. While RuscaRL extends this to open-ended domains with rubric scheduling, the conceptual contribution is incremental rather than groundbreaking.

### Questions
Q1. What caused Rubric-based RL’s entropy explosion at step 200? Did this issue occur across all models and seeds, or was it run-specific? Did the authors try tuning or stabilizing the baseline (e.g., different KL, learning rate, sampling parameters/top-p)? Finally, do the reported gains still hold when the baseline remains stable?

### Summary
The paper proposes RuscaRL, a rubric-scaffolded reinforcement learning framework for LLMs. It introduces (1) intra-group rubric differentiation to encourage diverse rollouts and (2) a sigmoid inter-step schedule to gradually remove rubric hints. Rubric criteria are reused as binary “verifiable” rewards via another LLM judge. The method is evaluated on medical QA, instruction following, writing, and STEM tasks.

### Strengths
1. The empirical results show improvements across several domains and model sizes.

2. The motivation (mitigating exploration bottlenecks in RL for LLMs) is interesting and relevant.

3. Different ablation studies are included.

4. The results are overall interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. Overstated novelty: Rubric rewards, scaffolded prompting, and gradual hint removal resemble prior work in rubric-guided RL, chain-of-thought prompting, and curriculum learning. The related work section cites almost exclusively 2025 works; the absence of foundational literature (curriculum RL, reward shaping, structured exploration strategies) is problematic.

2. Related-work coverage: Classical literature on exploration, curriculum RL, and scaffolding is missing.

3. Insufficient exploration baselines: No comparison against established exploration strategies (e.g., entropy-guided branching, curriculum RL variants, prolonged compute), making it hard to support claims about breaking exploration bottlenecks.

4. Lack of statistical rigor: Results are reported without standard deviations or confidence intervals, despite typical high variance in RL settings.

5. Dependence on rubric quality: The method assumes rubrics are complete, well-weighted, and unbiased. No analysis of noisy, incomplete, or contradictory criteria is provided.

6. LLM-as-judge fragility: Evaluation relies on a single judge model without cross-judge agreement, calibration, or human validation, risking optimization toward judge quirks.

7. Shallow compliance risk: Binary criteria may reward formatting or keyword heuristics rather than genuine reasoning, but no analysis investigates this failure mode.

8. Figure and clarity issues: Figure 1 (left) is not informative, and Figure 2 is understandable only after reading the text carefully; simpler visualizations could improve clarity.

### Questions
1.	How does performance change when swapping the judge model? Do results remain stable?

2.	What happens if rubric criteria are reordered or partially corrupted?

3.	Can the authors compare against entropy-based approaches or curriculum RL as well as recent exploration approaches under matched compute?

4.	Can you provide standard deviations or confidence intervals for all tables?

### Summary
This study investigated the RL exploration issue, introducing the Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL) framework designed to overcome the exploration bottleneck in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Traditional RL for LLM reasoning struggles because learning high-quality reasoning requires exploration, yet the model’s exploration capacity is limited by its own reasoning ability. Empirically, the approach shows faster reward improvement, higher diversity, and better generalization than baselines.

### Strengths
1. The integration of instructional scaffolding method into RL for LLMs is highly good.


2. Demonstrates consistent gains across diverse benchmarks (HealthBench, MedQA, MMLU-Pro, Creative Writing, IFBench, etc.).


3. RuscaRL shows better sample efficiency (steeper Best-of-N curve) and avoids entropy collapse, evidencing better exploration control.

### Weaknesses
1. The method’s success hinges on well-designed, domain-specific rubrics. Poorly constructed rubrics may bias training or limit diversity.
2. The paper acknowledges this but does not propose automated rubric construction or robustness checks.


3. Using rubric-guided multi-sample rollouts with LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations is computationally expensive, especially for large-scale training (many rollouts × multiple criteria × grader calls).


4. While results are strong across domains, the framework’s behavior under noisy or conflicting rubrics is not deeply analyzed.

### Questions
1. How sensitive is RuscaRL to rubric design noise or inconsistency across domains (e.g., mixing medical and creative writing rubrics)?


2. What are the computational and inference costs compared to standard pipelines?
