# Intrinsic Memory Agents: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent LLM Systems through Structured Contextual Memory

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 4, 4

## Abstract
Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory that preserves specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. Our approach utilises a generic memory template applicable to new problems without the need to hand-craft specific memory prompts. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL, FEVER, and ALFWorld datasets, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing state-of-the-art or comparable performance across all three, with the highest consistency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, and we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs across 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness, and documentation, plus additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new system to augment LLMs with contextual memory.

There are lots of systems that attempt to do something similar, the main contribution here is the use of a "multi-agent system", where there are several agents responsible for storing the structured memories relevant for different contexts.

The idea is overall reasonable, though the paper is fairly non-techhnical, and the baselines fairly limited.

### Strengths
Addresses an overall important problem and limitation in existing LLMs

Specific and reasonable solution and methodological contribution, difference compared to existing approaches is quite clear

### Weaknesses
Paper is highly non-technical, it presents an idea but it's a fairly simple system that mightn't meet the bar as a technical contribution for ICLR

Most critically, the technical evaluation is *very* limited. Just a single baseline (it's hard to figure out exactly what this is?), and a data pipeline that seems to be of the author's own invention. Not much by way of comparison to what seems like a "state-of-the-art" memory system. This seems mostly a dealbreaker for acceptance to ICLR

### Questions
Can you provide more detail about the specifics of the baseline? Why can't other baselines be considered? Can the method be evaluated on standard datasets that are widely used? Can it be compared to other structured memory systems?

### Summary
This paper proposes the Intrinsic Memory Agents framework for MAS. IMA tackles the memory decay and role drift, which are caused by constrained context windows. It achieves this by introducing structured, agent-specific memory templates that dynamically update based on the agent's outputs, ensuring memory remains concise and role-aligned for complex tasks.

### Strengths
The proposed output-driven memory evolution offers a specialized solution to the context window problem in MAS. This mechanism helps maintain role adherence by constantly refreshing agent-specific context, which benefits the performance of MAS on two downstream tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The core mechanism of IMA—refining a structured memory template based on self-output, primarily operates at the prompt engineering level. The design lacks a distinct technical contribution, relying entirely on an LLM's internal reasoning step. The authors must rigorously justify why this intrinsic, prompt-based refinement constitutes a novel advance beyond existing context management techniques.

2. The experimental validation is limited to a specific set of collaborative tasks, which restricts the assessment of IMA's utility for general MAS problems. To credibly claim the framework's utility for complex collaborative problem-solving, evaluation should extend to more representative MAS benchmarks like coding.

3. The authors are encouraged to provide explicit, documented examples showing some bad cases of baseline agent memory updating methods, and how IMA's structured memory successfully prevents that specific failure mode. This is essential for understanding the mechanism's real-world impact.

4. The experimental validation is confined to a standard, sequential MAS system. The claimed benefits of agent-specific memory management need rigorous discussion regarding its universality across more complex MAS backbones.

### Questions
1. Is the performance of IMA  dependent on the capability of the underlying LLM? Please provide an ablation study showing the performance of the full framework when substituting the primary LLM.

2. Has the author studied the influence of agent numbers on the effectiveness of the proposed method?

### Summary
The paper addresses context window limitations in multi-agent LLM systems , which impair memory consistency and role adherence. It introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents (IMA), a framework using structured, agent-specific memory templates. Unlike other methods, these memories are updated "intrinsically" from each agent's own output rather than via external summarization. This approach is designed to maintain heterogeneous, role-aligned perspectives. The method is evaluated on the PDDL benchmark, reportedly showing a 38.6% improvement over state-of-the-art memory approaches , and on a complex data pipeline design task, where it outperforms a baseline on 5 quality metrics.

### Strengths
1. Clear motivation and problem framing: The paper clearly articulates the problem it aims to solve and provides a strong rationale for its approach.

2. Clear and organized presentation: The paper is well-organized and uses language that is easy to understand, making the core concepts accessible.

3. Provides detailed experimental details for reproducibility: The inclusion of specific details, such as the prompts used (Appendix B), is commendable and supports the reproducibility of the work.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited experimental evaluation: The evaluation is confined to the PDDL benchmark and a single case study. In contrast, other significant works in this area (e.g., G-Memory) are often evaluated on a more diverse set of benchmarks spanning multiple domains.

2. Limited statistical robustness of the PDDL benchmark: The PDDL benchmark results are based on a single run with a set seed (Sec 4). This severely limits the statistical significance of the results presented in Table 1 and makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the performance gains.

3. Reliance on manual, task-specific template engineering: The framework's performance heavily depends on structured memory templates that are created manually for each specific task. The paper suggests "automated or generalized" methods as future work but provides no ablation study on the sensitivity to template design. It is unclear how much of the performance gain is due to the core intrinsic memory concept versus having a perfectly-tuned, hand-crafted template.

### Questions
1. Could the evaluation be expanded to include more standard multi-agent benchmarks, such as ALFWORLD, HotpotQA, or FEVER, to demonstrate the method's generalizability?

2. Could the authors re-run the PDDL experiments (Sec 4) with multiple different random seeds for all compared methods? This would provide statistically robust results (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and add necessary confidence to the claims in Table 1.

3. Could the authors conduct an ablation study to analyze the framework's sensitivity to the quality of the manually created templates? For instance, how does performance degrade if a sub-optimal or more generic template is used? This would help isolate the true contribution of the intrinsic update mechanism.

### Summary
This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a multi-agent LLM framework with structured agent-specific memories (intrinsically updated) to solve context window limits. It outperforms peers by 38.6% on PDDL, excels in data pipeline metrics, and maintains top token efficiency. Its structured memory templates align with agent roles, fixing gaps of methods like RAG that lack role-specific consistency. In data pipeline tasks, it offers specific tools (e.g., AWS Kinesis) and trade-offs, outshining baselines in key quality aspects.

### Strengths
- **Novel and Relevant Methodology:** The authors do a good job of identifying a real-world limitation of multi-agent systems: how homogeneous memory causes agents to lose their specialized perspectives. Their proposed "Intrinsic Memory" with "Structured Templates" is a novel and well-thought-out solution to this problem. This approach seems to directly target the core challenges of role adherence and perspective inconsistency.
- **Rigorous Case Study Evaluation:** The data pipeline design case study is excellent. The authors used a complex, realistic task involving eight specialized agents. Critically, they based the evaluation on 10 independent runs. Their use of an LLM-as-a-Judge, combined with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (as shown by the p-values in Table 2), is methodologically rigorous and makes the results convincing.
- **High Reproducibility:** I was impressed by the commitment to reproducibility. The paper provides extensive details in Section 8 and the appendix. This includes the key algorithms (Alg. 1, 2), the exact memory update prompt (Fig. 4), the task prompt (Fig. 5), and the evaluation prompt (Fig. 6). This level of transparency is commendable.

### Weaknesses
- **Manual Template Engineering and Limited Generality:** The method's biggest weakness is its reliance on "manually created," task-specific templates. The authors acknowledge this in Section 6. This reliance on expert human effort means the framework can't be easily generalized to new tasks or different agent roles, which severely limits its practical, out-of-the-box utility.
- **Methodological Flaw in PDDL Benchmark:** I am not convinced by the conclusions from the PDDL benchmark (Section 4). The results in Table 1 are based on "a single run". Given the high variance of LLM agent systems, a single run is not sufficient to draw any robust conclusions. 
- **Significant Token Overhead:** This approach introduces a non-trivial cost. The IMA system used 32% more tokens in the case study (Table 2). This extra cost seems to come from two places: 1) the extra LLM call (f_memory_update) needed for every single memory update, and 2) the longer input context (C_n,m) that each agent receives, as it now includes the structured memory.
- **Low Absolute Scores on Key Metrics:** It's important to note that while IMA performed better in *relative* terms, its *absolute* scores for "Usability" (3.67/10) and "Documentation" (3.56/10) are still quite low (Table 2). This suggests that even with a better memory system, the underlying base model (Llama-3.2-3b) struggles to produce documentation that is truly usable for engineers.

### Questions
1. **On template generality:** Regarding the main weakness (manual templates), have you explored any ways to automate this? For instance, could a "meta-prompt" be used to generate the JSON structure for an agent (MT_n) just from its role description (R_n)?
2. **On PDDL robustness:** Could you please clarify the PDDL benchmark results (Table 1)? Specifically, can you provide the mean and standard deviation over multiple independent runs (e.g., 5-10)? Without that, it's difficult to assess the confidence of those findings.
3. **On token overhead:** Could you provide a more detailed breakdown of the 32% token overhead? I'm curious how much of that cost is from the extra f_memory_update call (Eq. 3) versus the cost of simply having a longer context for the main agent (L_n, Eq. 2)?
4. **On performance bottlenecks:** Are the low absolute scores for "Usability" and "Documentation" a fundamental limitation of the Llama-3.2-3b model, or is it a limitation of the IMA framework? In other words, if you swapped in a more powerful model (like GPT-4o), would you expect those scores to jump significantly?
