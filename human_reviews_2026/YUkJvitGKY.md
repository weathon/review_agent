## Abstract
Recent ObjectNav systems credit large language models (LLMs) for sizable zero-shot gains, yet it remains unclear how much comes from language versus geometry. We revisit this question by re-evaluating an instruction-guided pipeline, InstructNav, under a detector-controlled setting and introducing two training-free variants that only alter the action value map: a geometry-only Frontier Proximity Explorer (FPE) and a lightweight Semantic-Heuristic Frontier (SHF) that polls the LLM with simple frontier votes. Across HM3D and MP3D, FPE matches or exceeds the detector-controlled instruction follower while using no API calls and running faster; SHF attains comparable accuracy with a smaller, localized language prior. These results suggest that carefully engineered frontier geometry accounts for much of the reported progress, and that language is most reliable as a light heuristic rather than an end-to-end planner.

### Summary
This paper challenges the common assumption that large language models are the primary drivers of recent performance gains in instruction-guided navigation. Through a controlled study, the authors introduce two training-free variants of InstructNav: Frontier Proximity Explorer (FPE), a purely geometric method that uses frontier proximity as the action prior, and Semantic-Heuristic Frontier (SHF), which adds a lightweight language heuristic to FPE by polling the LLM for semantic votes over frontier islands. On HM3D and MP3D datasets, FPE matches or exceeds the performance of the detector-controlled InstructNav-GT baseline, achieving the highest SR on HM3D and highest SPL on MP3D, while requiring 0 API cost and running significantly faster. SHF attains comparable accuracy to InstructNav-GT with a smaller, localized language prior. The results suggest that carefully engineered frontier geometry accounts for much of the reported progress, and that language is most reliable as a light heuristic rather than an end-to-end planner.

### Strengths
- **Originality**: The paper offers a compelling critique of the over-attribution of navigation gains to LLMs. By isolating geometric exploration from language and perception, it reveals that a simple frontier-based strategy (FPE) and Semantic-Heuristic Frontier (SHF) can match or outperform complex LLM-driven planners—challenging prevailing trends and advocating for more efficient, transparent designs in embodied AI.
- **Quality**: The evaluation is thorough and well-controlled, using ground-truth semantics to isolate planning effects, standard benchmarks (HM3D/MP3D), and key metrics including API cost and runtime. The ablations clearly disentangle the roles of geometry and language.
- **Clarity**: Concepts like frontier islands, FPE, and SHF are clearly defined, well-illustrated, and accompanied by concise pseudocode. The writing is precise, and comparisons to prior work are fair and transparent.

### Weaknesses
- **Insufficient practical deployment discussion**: Although the paper mentions computational efficiency, it doesn't discuss the practical implications of deploying FPE and SHF on real robots with limited computational resources. The authors should address potential challenges (e.g., memory usage, real-time constraints) and propose solutions for real-world deployment.
- **Limited analysis of SHF’s design choices**: SHF uses $k=5$ LLM votes per step, but the choice of $ k $ is unexplained. Is this critical for performance? A small ablation would help justify the cost–accuracy trade-off and support the claim that “minimal language priors suffice.
- **Ambiguity in “training-free” and experience assumptions**: While FPE/SHF require no model training, they rely on ground-truth semantics and perfect frontier detection. Does this assume oracle perception? If so, how would performance degrade under realistic detectors?
- **Contribution**: The paper’s main strength lies in its empirical revelation—frontier-based geometric exploration alone can rival or exceed LLM-driven planners in ObjectNav. This is a valuable corrective to the field’s current emphasis on language-centric designs. However, this work does not propose a new framework or solve a recognized problem, or offer clear guidance for future system design beyond “use strong geometric priors.” While insightful, this level of contribution may be insufficient for a full ICLR publication.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the rapidly evolving field of LLM-based object navigation and conducts an in-depth, critical analysis of existing approaches. Its core objective is to address a pivotal, yet underexplored research question in the domain: For the significant performance gains observed in recent LLM-augmented navigation systems, are they primarily driven by sophisticated prompting strategies and the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or do they heavily rely on hand-engineered geometric information that implicitly simplifies the navigation challenge?

By strategically stripping away the extensive LLM guidance components of InstructNav and retaining only minimal LLM assistance, the authors propose two novel object navigation methods, namely FPE and SHF, which still achieve competitive results on the object navigation benchmarks with low cost and better efficiency.

### Strengths
(1) This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the LLM-based navigation approach and provides interesting conclusions on guiding future works to design better ObjectNav approaches with a thorough ablation study.
(2) The proposed approach is much more efficient than the previous LLM-based navigation method (InstructNav) in both deployment cost and inference efficiency, which is important for real-world scenarios.
(3) The paper is in well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
(1) A key limitation of the work lies in the task-specificity of its adopted frontier-based navigation paradigm, which constrains the generalizability of the proposed FPE and SHF methods. While this paradigm proves effective for the object navigation scenarios targeted in the study—specifically, searching for large, easily distinguishable objects (e.g., chairs, sofas, televisions) within the HM3D benchmark—it exhibits notable shortcomings when extended to broader navigation tasks or more challenging object types.​ For example, when searching for small objects, approaching certain types of receptacles is important, and a frontier-based paradigm cannot accomplish such tasks.

(2) As the main contribution of this paper is to make an analysis of whether the LLM's knowledge is one of the major factors that influence the navigation method performance, but work currently focuses solely on validating a "negative" scenario: that removing most LLM guidance (i.e., retaining only minimal assistance) does not lead to performance degradation of the proposed FPE/SHF methods compared to the baseline InstructNav. However, it completely omits the "positive" dimension of verification—whether a more intelligent LLM (with stronger knowledge and reasoning capabilities) can further enhance the performance of LLM-based navigation approaches.

### Questions
(1) There are no real-world evaluations or demonstrations for comparison among the proposed approaches with the baseline methods. Are the conclusions still the same when transferred to the real world? 
(2) How well do the proposed FBE and SHF perform on the more challenging ObjectNav benchmark, such as HM3D-OVON [1] ?

### Summary
This paper revisits the large language models (LLMs) in instruction-guided ObjectNav systems by introducing two training-free variants: FPE (Frontier Proximity Explorer), a purely geometric baseline, and SHF (Semantic-Heuristic Frontier), which adds lightweight LLM-based frontier voting. Through controlled experiments on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks, the authors demonstrate that FPE matches or exceeds InstructNav-GT (a detector-controlled baseline) while requiring no API calls, and SHF achieves comparable performance with reduced computational cost. The paper argues that carefully engineered geometric priors account for much of the reported progress in LLM-augmented navigation, and that language is most effective as a light heuristic rather than an end-to-end planner.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses a critical question about whether reported gains in LLM-based navigation come from language intelligence or geometric engineering, it introduces two training-free (FPE and SHF) for frontier votes.

2. The use of ground-truth semantic sensors (InstructNav-GT) provides a fair comparison that isolates planning effects from perception noise, establishing a methodologically sound baseline.

### Weaknesses
1. Insufficient Analysis of When Language Helps: SHF sometimes matches or underperforms InstructNav-GT, but there's no analysis of which categories/scenarios benefit from language, may need more analysis.

2. Maybe it is better to compare against LFG directly on the same experimental setup, despite SHF being inspired by it. This would strengthen the claim about language-as-heuristic being sufficient.

### Questions
1. One question about the detector impact is - what is FPE's performance when using the same GLEE detector as original InstructNav? This would clarify whether the gains truly come from geometry vs. removing detector noise.

2. What happens to SHF performance as you vary k from 1 to 10? Is there a sweet spot that's more efficient than k=5?

3. How do you think the proposed approach generalization to different LLMs?

### Summary
This method studies if and how LLMs are actually useful in object-goal navigation in unknown environments. The authors compare a pure geometric frontier exploration method with one where the LLM scores the frontiers and one where the LLM takes over the planning. THey compare these methods in standard benchmarks and surprisingly find that the pure geometric method is competitive or better than the LLM-based approaches.

### Strengths
- This is the first paper that I read in a while that actually explicitly formulates a research question. While mostly an empirical work, the authors are producing evidence to answer the research question and overall contribute towards new knowledge not just by "this method works better". I think that is positively refreshing!
- The results of this study are highly relevant to the larger community. It is really unexpected HOW well the frontier-only approach.
- The paper is well structured and easy to read even if somebody just wants to skim over it.

### Weaknesses
- Since so much of this paper depends on the empirical evidence in Table 1, it is highly problematic that this Table puts methods that have access to a ground-truth oracle directly next to methods that do not. This severely limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this study, because there is only a single LLM-based method (InstructNav) that gets access to the same GT. This leaves much room for the option that simply InstructNav is not a great way of incorporating a LLM into planning, and other methods such as VLFM (which also incorporates geometric planning) are a much better planning approach that might have significant margin over the geometry-only approach. A much more sound study would be to split this up: compare FPE and SHF with an open-vocabulary detector to all the baselines in Table 1 and add ground-truth semantics to 1-2 additional methods and conduct a fair comparison in a different Table.
- Given that the constructed baselines are partially based on LFG (shah et al), I am surprised not to see this method anywhere in the comparison
- There are some inclarities and ambiguities in the introduction of the study that can make it confusing to readers and might lead them to wrong conclusions:
  - Habitat and MP3D are not photorealisitic. One criterion for photorealisitic is e.g. disentangled lighting and shading [[ref]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Roberts_Hypersim_A_Photorealistic_Synthetic_Dataset_for_Holistic_Indoor_Scene_Understanding_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) which matterport datasets do not habe
  - The summary of the finding in lines 46 and following does not specify the task. The usefulness of semantic & language priors differs a lot between explortion, object goal navigation, and instruction following, so it is very important to specify here that the task is 2D object goal navigation in unseen environments.
  - line 70: The definition of Object-Goal Navigation is wrong. This task is not per-definition in novel environments, but the task that this study looks at is a subcategory. Consider e.g. [HOV-SG](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss20/p077.pdf) that also studies Object-Goal Navigation, but in known environments.
  - line 104 introduces the task as reaching an instance in a 3D environment, yet Section 3.2 restricts all methods to a 2D navigation map. Compared to works that actually can do 3D multi-floor navigation (eg. HOV-SG above), it is important to distinuish that this study is much more limited to 2D navigation.
  - the phrase "frontier islands" is quite confusing. Usually literature just calls these clusters frontiers.


Overall I find this work very valuable and the question highly relevant. However, the study has big limitations that reduce the value of the findings. I would be open to raise my score in case that some of these concerns are addressed.

### Questions
- Not a weakness but a suggestion: The authors may want to consider not only SPL as a metric, but also weighting by "action". Usually for these ICLR-style works a big limitation is that methods are overfit to "spin in place" because this behaviour is "free" resp. not accounted for as cost in the SPL metric even tough it significantly increases search time. Weighting per action (e.g. as proposed by [FrontierNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04597)) is a more fair comparison and might actually show some more advantages of the geometric approach.
- Figure 2b: Why does the FPE planner turn in place in the top-right corner and goes back to the left part of the corridor? Why does it leave some small frontiers to the left and right of the corridor unexplored? This looks suspicious and suggests that this planner is quite tuned/overfit towards matterport scans.
- Figure 3: It is very hard to understand for me what a reader is supposed to see in this map. Would a statistic of empty value maps in InstructNav-GT over all episodes not be much more informative?
