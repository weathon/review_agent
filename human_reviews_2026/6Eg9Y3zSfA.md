- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 2, 4, 4

## Abstract
The rapid growth of the focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) creates the need for an effective AI tool for evaluating corporate sustainability. Despite the increasing availability of ESG data disclosed by companies, the complex, relational, and unstructured nature of ESG reports poses significant challenges for large-scale LLMs. The surprising efficacy of small language models (SLMs) on domain-specific tasks challenges the prevailing belief that only massive, general-purpose models can tackle complex reasoning. Inspired by this observation, we investigate the potential of compact models in the nuanced field of ESG analysis, arguing that the path to true expertise lies in focused knowledge and structured collaboration. Our work presents a two-fold contribution to realize this vision: 1) We introduce ESGEXPERT-30K, a new knowledge-intensive dataset, to fine-tune a compact SLM into a specialized ESGEEK model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on domain-specific QA. 2) We propose DIAL-G², a novel framework where these expert agents form a committee to analyze full, multimodal corporate reports. In DIAL-G², agents populate a shared graph with conflicting arguments. The GNN then performs relational inference on this graph and uses its learned attention weights to direct the agents’ focus towards the most salient and contested information in a subsequent debate phase. This graph-guided approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness. Furthermore, on our newly contributed, large-scale ESGREPORT-RATING-50K benchmark, DIAL-G² achieves human-expert-level performance in end-to-end ESG score prediction. Extensive experiments show that DIAL-G² can overcome bottlenecks of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in domain-specific understanding, providing the ESG research community with a powerful new paradigm for scalable, relational, and interpretable AI.

### Summary
This work primarily focuses on two tasks related to ESG: question answering and scoring. A curated and validated dataset was collected to fine-tune existing large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific adaptation. In addition, a graph neural network (GNN) was designed for the regression task, where the LLM serves as an agent to assist in text processing.

### Strengths
S1. The proposed ESG question-answering dataset is generated based on real-world ESG standards, which could provide valuable support for the domain, and its data scale is relatively substantial.

### Weaknesses
1. I could not find the dataset in the appendix. The authors stated in the **Reproducibility Statement** that the dataset is provided there, but I only found corresponding descriptions in the `readme.md` file.
2. The method section could be presented more clearly. Most of it focuses on how the GNN for scoring is designed, where the possibly distinctive elements are the *Proponent* and *Skeptic*. Unfortunately, the specific meaning, implementation details, and design motivation of these components are omitted.
3. The work lacks originality. Although it includes multiple components—two task datasets, models of different parameter scales, and a GNN architecture for scoring—most of the techniques used are existing ones. The dataset construction (using GPT-4o for QA generation), model fine-tuning (via SFT), and the GNN design mainly reuse or recombine prior works rather than introducing targeted technical innovations.
4. The ESG task seems to lack distinctiveness. After reading the paper, it appears that ESG documents are not essentially different from those used in standard RAG or GraphRAG pipelines, which also involve extracting text and images from PDFs and performing similarity-based retrieval. Whether ESG presents unique challenges should be a key focus of the work—and potentially its most compelling aspect.

### Questions
As mentioned in the weaknesses:

1. What interests me most is the technical distinction between ESG and other document analysis tasks.

2. You could consider incorporating fine-tuning with the latest large model, DeepSeek-R1, and directly comparing performance on the scoring task. If the GNN architecture demonstrates clear superiority without disrupting the model’s “thinking” process, that would highlight its technical value. Moreover, it would be even better if comparisons with classic GNN architectures were also included.

3. I believe the dataset is a valuable contribution, but I currently cannot access any actual samples.please make them available.

### Summary
This paper proposes DIAL-G$^2$ framework for ESG score prediction task. In detail, to better exploit ESG reports, the authors first construct the ESGExpert-30K dataset using GPT-4o combined with human validation. This dataset is then used to train a smaller model, ESGeek. The proposed DIAL-G$^2$ framework guides ESGeek through iterative cross-page dialogues, supported by a GNN reasoner. Experiments conducted on another newly created dataset, ESGReport-Rating-50K, demonstrate the effectiveness of ESGExpert and DIAL-G$^2$.

### Strengths
1. This work introduces two datasets, ESGExpert-30K and ESGReport-Rating-50K, both validated by humans. These datasets are highly beneficial for future research in ESG question answering and ESG score prediction.
2. DIAL-G$^2$ framework, with GNN-based guidance, effectively supports reasoning across multiple pages of long reports. This idea can not only be applied to ESG QA but also extended to other domains.
3. Experimental results in Table 1 show the proposed ESGeek significantly outperforms baselines, despite having only 0.5B parameters. And runtime analysis demonstrates both ESGeek and DIAL-G$^2$ are efficient, supporting their potential for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1.  Pair-level limitation. DIAL-G$^2$ guides agents to conduct analysis / rebuttal on two pages, while generation often requires integrating information across multiple pages. Thus, the pair-level guidance may limit the ability to combine evidence from multiple pages.
2.  Unclear gradient flow. While the authors dedicate a paragraph to training dynamics, it remains unclear how gradients back-propagate between continuous embeddings (in the differentiable GNN) and discrete tokens (in the non-differentiable agent debate).
3.  Limited ablation on hyper-parameters. Proposed DIAL-G$^2$ utilize fixed settings such as a similarity threshold $\tau = 0.8$, debate trigger probability $p=0.3$, and the number of loops $K=2$. However, there is no analysis of how sensitive the final prediction quality is to these parameters.
4.  Missing experiments details. The authors claim ESGeek is a 0.5B SLM fine-tuned on ESGExpert-30K in section in section 4.1. However, subsequent experiments utilize 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B and 7B sizes. Moreover, the fine-tuning details are missing.
5.  Poor writing. The paper contains lots of unclear symbol definitions and writing errors. See questions 2 and 3.

### Questions
1. Why is ESGeek able to surpass GPT-4o, given that most of its knowledge is distilled from it (through the GPT–generated training dataset)?
2. Unclear symbol definition: Line 214, does $\mathrm{x}$ equal with $\mathrm{h}$? How are the attention weights $\alpha$ (line 251) and the target question q_{follow\_up} (line 261) used in each iteration? What are the definitions of  $W_{g}$ and $b_{g}$ in line 269?
3. Writing errors: missing appendix reference in line 319, legend error in Figure 3, truncated sentence in the last paragraph (line 485), and missing citation in line 987.
4. What version of GPT-4o is used, and what parameter settings (e.g., temperature) are applied?
5. What are the detailed statistics of ESGExpert-30K?
6. In Appendix B.2, one report may correspond to multiple ratings. Which score is used to compute the final metric during evaluation?

### Summary
The paper introduces ESGEXPERT-30K, a knowledge-intensive dataset designed to fine-tune a compact small language model (SLM) into a specialized ESGEEK model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain-specific ESG question answering. In addition, the authors propose DIAL-G², a novel multi-agent framework where multiple expert agents collaborate as a committee to analyze comprehensive, multimodal corporate reports.

### Strengths
1. I think modeling dialectical reasoning with structured representations is a significant and meaningful research direction.

### Weaknesses
I am not an expert in this specific field, but from my perspective, the paper has the following shortcomings.

1. The contributions are somewhat scattered, and the relationships among them are not well organized or clearly integrated into a coherent framework.

2. The paper is somewhat hard to read; a clearer and more coherent organizational structure would significantly improve readability.

3. The experiments are limited to comparisons with a few baseline large models, lacking deeper analysis to substantiate the authors’ claims. More thorough ablation or error analyses are needed.

### Summary
This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline for ESG reasoning, focusing on two main tasks: Relational ESG Question Answering and Multimodal ESG Score Prediction. The proposed framework consists of several key components, including evidence graph construction, entity representation learning, LLM-based reasoning, and answer prediction, among others. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, while the paper addresses a novel problem in the field of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) analysis, the techniques employed are largely standard and do not introduce substantial methodological innovation. As a result, the overall contribution of the paper is somewhat limited.

### Strengths
The problem studied in this paper is relatively new, making the work both novel and interesting. It explores an emerging direction in ESG reasoning that has not been widely addressed before. The proposed model is composed of multiple well-designed components, such as evidence graph construction, expert agent collaboration, and graph-guided debate mechanisms, which together make the overall framework promising and technically rich. 

In the experimental section, the authors provide a comprehensive evaluation by comparing their approach with a range of different large language models, including GPT-4o-mini, Qwen-2.5-0.5B, DeepSeek-R1, and others. These comparisons help demonstrate the effectiveness of their method and show that the proposed model achieves competitive or even superior performance under various settings.

### Weaknesses
The techniques used in this paper are fairly standard, which diminishes the overall contribution. Most components in the proposed framework rely on commonly used methods, making the technical novelty somewhat limited.

In terms of writing, there is also room for improvement. Some sections, such as 4.2.3 and 4.3, contain very short paragraphs that could be better organized and merged to improve readability and flow.

Moreover, the ablation study section is relatively brief, containing only one paragraph. A more comprehensive ablation analysis would strengthen the paper, for example by examining different embedding learning strategies, alternative reasoning mechanisms, and the individual contribution of each component within the pipeline.
