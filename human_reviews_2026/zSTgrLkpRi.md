## Abstract
This paper centers around a novel concept proposed recently by researchers from the control community where the training process of a deep neural network can be considered a nonlinear dynamical system acting upon the high-dimensional weight space. Koopman operator theory (KOT), a data-driven dynamical system analysis framework, can then be deployed to discover the otherwise non-intuitive training dynamics. Taking advantage of the predictive power of KOT, the time-consuming Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) iterations can be then bypassed by directly predicting network weights a few epochs later. This "predictive training" framework, however, often suffers from gradient explosion especially for more extensive and complex models. In this paper, we incorporate the idea of "differential learning" into the predictive training framework and propose the so-called "predictive differential training" (PDT) for accelerated learning even for complex network structures. The key contribution is the design of an effective masking strategy based on a dynamic consistency analysis, which selects only those predicted weights whose local training dynamics align with the global dynamics. We refer to these predicted weights as high-fidelity predictions. DT also includes the design of an acceleration scheduler to adjust the prediction interval and rectify deviations from off-predictions. We demonstrate that PDT can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-in with a diverse array of existing optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, LAMB, etc.). The experimental results show consistent performance improvement across different network architectures and various datasets, in terms of faster convergence and reduced training time (10-40%) to achieve the baseline's best loss, while maintaining (if not improving) final model accuracy. As the idiom goes, a rising tide lifts all boats; in our context, a subset of high-fidelity predicted weights can accelerate the training of the entire network!

### Summary
*disclaimer* I only used LLM for understanding of part of sec 3.2. 

The paper proposes an acceleration strategy for accelerating first order methods (SGD and variants) esp. in large scale deep learning systems. The strategy is to use linear approximation to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of weight updates in DNN with first order methods. In particular, the authors propose a predictive differential training  which serves as plug in tool in SGD or variant optimizer. It starts with SGD updates for a few steps and then use these snapshots to linear approximate and forecast a few steps in the future.  To accept the forecasted weights one by one, the author proposed the two criteria: acceleration effectiveness criterion and dynamic consistency criterion so that the predicted dynamics can be in accordance to the global optimizer dynamics. Empirical results show the effective acceleration on large scale systems in Vision applications and networks.

### Strengths
Strengths include 1) theoretical inspired by koopman operator theory . The authors adapts to a computational efficient approach using linear approximation. (and some numerical decomposition for predicted weights) 2) the authors also show the justification of using masking strategy to make “Acceleration” possible and meaningful. 3). The quality of experiments are very high by not only showing the loss and acc reduction but also computation analysis, and show a variety of 1st order optimizers . 3) the topic is interesting in DL optimization community. 4) the presention of this paper is always good to follow.

### Weaknesses
Weakness include 1).  No thorough literature search in this line of work: for example a) Introspection:accelerating neural network training by learning weight evolution. b) Learning to Boost Training by Periodic Nowcasting Near Future Weights and a few other following this line of work.  Correspondingly, authors should include some baselines from this line of work for highlighting the superiority of proposed method  2) The proof of convergence should be discussed in more detail for theorem 1.

### Questions
1 In Line 371, the paper states: “the masked ratio always starts with higher values in the early stage of the training process, then generally decreases as training progresses.” The authors further suggest that this reflects the increasing complexity of training dynamics in large networks on large datasets, making them harder to predict. I am not entirely convinced by this explanation. 
If I understand correctly, the weight is masked  means the predicted weight is accept. 
Intuitively, this trend may also be influenced by how stochastic gradient descent (and its variants) behaves: early in training, the loss landscape is typically easier to optimize, leading to faster reduction in loss and more stable gradient directions, which in turn may allow more weights to pass the masking criteria. Later in training, as the optimizer approaches (local) minima, gradients oscillate more around the optimum, making it harder to accept predicted weights for prediction horizons like 5 steps. Could the authors clarify or comment on whether this trend may be more related to optimizer behavior rather than intrinsic “complexity of the dynamics”?

2. Has the authors conducted experiments analyzing the impact of different initial learning rates on the masked ratio behavior? Intuitively, a smaller learning rate might lead to more stable gradient directions, thereby increasing the proportion of weights that satisfy the masking criteria early in training. Conversely, larger initial learning rates might introduce more variability and lower the acceptance ratio. That also affects the computational analysis and efficiency of the current approach in the appendix.  

3. The current empirical evaluation focuses exclusively on vision tasks (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet, ViT). While these results are compelling, it would significantly strengthen the work if the method were also evaluated on other domains, such as NLP or speech models. This would help demonstrate the generality and robustness of the PDT framework across architectures and modalities.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of accelerating neural network training through predictive differential training - that is, predicting the future weight values of the network during training to bypass gradient descent steps. To predict the weight values at future epochs, the authors apply dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) over a small window of past weight values. The authors then show that DMD alone is insufficient for stable training, and propose masking strategy that determines which parameters will be accelerated via DMD, and which will use SGD-based updates. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their algorithm can enhance many different types of optimizers. Also the proposed algorithm is found to work on both image classification and self-supervised learning, further highlighting the robustness of the study.

### Strengths
1.	The proposed algorithm has multiple well motivated components, that ultimately lead to significant speed ups across multiple architectures and learning tasks. The study is not a simple application of DMD either, as the authors demonstrate that their masking strategy is crucial in speeding up model training. 
2.	The proposed method seems to be quite robust, showing performance improvement across not just different architectures, but also completely different problem types (self-supervised learning), optimizers, and out-of-distribution minibatch situations (A.8). These results are quite impressive.
3.	The paper is very clear, with the motivation and details of the algorithm clearly laid out. The use of toy problem also helps intuition and the authors provide extensive information about their experiments in the appendix, making their paper quite transparent.

### Weaknesses
1.	The convergence analysis in A.5 seems only to be a sketch of a proof and not a proper convergence proof. Furthermore, the inequality direction in equation 8 is different from the one show in the main text (equation 6).
2.	The proposed PDT method introduces 4 additional hyperparameters, which is a bit too many to select via brute force hyperparameter search. A heuristic for determining these values will be handy.

### Questions
1.	While the authors have adequately provided information on the computational complexity of their algorithm, I am also curious about the memory complexity. Naively thinking, I imagine that the additional memory required would scale as $N*h$ and then some more, related to the cost of performing SVD on a $N\times h$ matrix. Can the authors provide a comparison between their algorithm and SGD on this front? Does this additional memory requirement present any difficulties, or is this not an issue in practice?

2. For the proposed masking strategy, I am curious about the relative importance between the acceleration effectiveness criterion and the dynamic consistency criterion. Can the authors present an ablation experiment by using only one or the other? I am also curious if the changes in the masking ratio during training (A.7) is related to the different contributions of the two masking criteria during different stages of training.

3. The authors do mention that their method comes with couple of additional parameters and discusses their effect in A.9. Regarding this point, can the authors provide a rule of thumb for selecting these values given a training problem?

4. I am confused about the direction of the inequality in the acceleration criterion. While the main text seems so suggest that equation (6) is correct, the direction of the inequality between equation (6) and (8) is different. Can the authors clarify?

5. For each of the experiments, can the authors provide information of how many batches were in an epoch? I wan to get a better idea of how many gradient steps are being skipped by PDT method.

### Summary
This paper leverages the predictive capability of KOT and introduces a framework PDT to accelerate neural network training by allowing weight updates to bypass standard gradient steps and use predicted weights instead. A dynamic consistency analysis is proposed to ensure stability when scaling to larger networks, and experiments are conducted to demonstrate empirical gains.

### Strengths
1. The paper explores an interesting intersection between optimal control and DNNs training, highlighting a potentially useful connection between the two fields.
2. The authors conduct experiments across multiple optimizers, architectures, and datasets to demonstrate the generality and potential improvements of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The paper’s writing and logical flow make it difficult to understand what the proposed method actually does. The main text introduces several abstract notations (\(x_i, w_i, W_i, g, K, T\)) with minimal explanation or connection to gradient-based optimization. For example, the authors use \(x\), \(w\), and \(W\) all as inputs to \(g\), which easily confuses readers. The overall presentation would greatly benefit from clearer definitions, consistent notation, and explicit mapping to standard training dynamics.

- Most essential implementation details about how the Koopman operator is estimated, how prediction integrates with standard optimizers, and how the dynamic consistency mask is computed—are deferred to the appendix. Since reading appendices is optional during review, this omission makes it impossible to fully evaluate the method’s soundness, novelty, and overall contribution from the main paper alone.

- The toy example provided does not effectively illustrate why or how the method applies to general neural network training. Its formulation lacks connection even to a simple MLP and therefore fails to provide intuition or justification for why Koopman-based prediction should improve training efficiency.

- The paper mentions that predicted updates are applied "once a while," but it does not specifies or studies, either theoretically or empirically, how often these predictions should be used. This frequency is critical for both computational cost and model performance. Without an ablation study on this factor, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the reported improvements.

- The "mask," which seems to determine when to apply predicted updates, is central to the method’s stability but is not properly introduced or explained in the main text. It is defined only in the appendix as a binary gate based on heuristics. The paper does not justify why a mask is necessary, why it must be binary, or how this design choice impacts performance or stability.

- The method requires repeated SVD to estimate the Koopman operator, yet the paper provides no analysis of the associated computational overhead. There is no information about matrix sizes, decomposition frequency, or runtime breakdown. Since SVD can have cubic complexity, this omission raises serious concerns about scalability—especially given the claim of “10–40% faster convergence.”

### Questions
- Is $\mathcal{K}=\sum_k \lambda_k \phi_k $? Is $c_k = \langle \phi_k, g\rangle$?
- What is data matrices $W_i$ and $W_{i+1}$ in neural networks? Are they neural network weights parameters?
- When you say $A$ can be solved but you actually mean approximate? cuz equation (4) is not equal
- how frequent you apply the prediciton step? does that depends on the optimziers, network achitecures, datasets?

### **Questions for the Authors**

- Is $\mathcal{K}=\sum_k \lambda_k \phi_k $? Is $c_k = \langle \phi_k, g\rangle$?

- What are the data matrices $W_i$ and $W_{i+1}$ in the context of neural networks? Are they weight parameters?

- How frequently is the Koopman-based prediction step applied during training? Is the prediction frequency fixed or adaptive? Does it depend on the choice of optimizer, network architecture, or dataset?

- How is the **binary mask** implemented in practice? Is it computed at every prediction?  

- What is the computational cost of performing the SVD at each prediction step? How large are the snapshot matrices used in your experiments?

- How sensitive is PDT to the number of snapshots used for Koopman estimation? Have you tested different window lengths or ranks for the decomposition?

### Summary
The paper proposed PDT that selectively applies updates to accelerate the training. Their method can be integrated with diverse optimizers. The authors provides diverse experiments on synthetic data and realistic dataset that their methods can accelerate the training progess without sacrificing model performance.

### Strengths
1. Their method can be integrated with lots of classic optimizers as a plug-in tool.
2. The seletive design ensures the stability of training
3. The predictive power of PDT accelerates the convergence (in iteration-wise sense).

### Weaknesses
1. The measurement of runtime is not well explained. I'm not sure if the total runtime includes the prediction time for accelerated training for PDT. 
2. The training results cannot match SOTA sometimes. For example, in figure 10d, the training on ImageNet-1K using ViT-Base can achieve ~76% validation accuracy but in the figure the best is below 70%. Similar for the training of ImageNet-1K on ResNet50. 
3. The complexity analysis didn't cover the space analysis. So I'm not sure if it can extends to large-scale trainings as in these trainings space is also very critical.

### Questions
1. In figure 4, is the base optimizer SGD for PDT?
2. In line 1041, the citation is missing: "The PDT-related hyperparameters mentioned in Sec. ?? ".
