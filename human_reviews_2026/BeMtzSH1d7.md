# Submodular Function Minimization with Dueling Oracle

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 4, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
We consider submodular function minimization using a *dueling oracle*, a noisy pairwise comparison oracle that provides relative feedback on function values between two queried sets.
The oracle's responses are governed by a *transfer function*, which characterizes the relationship between differences in function values and the parameters of the response distribution.
For a linear transfer function, we propose an algorithm that achieves an error rate of $O(n^{\frac{3}{2}}/\sqrt{T})$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $T$ denotes the number of oracle calls.
We establish a lower bound: Under the constraint that differences between queried sets are bounded by a constant, any algorithm incurs an error of at least $\Omega(n^{\frac{3}{2}}/\sqrt{T})$.
Without such a constraint, the lower bound becomes $\Omega(n/\sqrt{T})$.
These results show that our algorithm is optimal up to constant factors for constrained algorithms.
For a sigmoid transfer function, we design an algorithm with an error rate of $O(n^{\frac{7}{5}}/T^{\frac{2}{5}})$,
and establish lower bounds analogous to the linear case.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of submodular function minimization under the noisy dueling oracle setting, where the algorithm receives noisy pairwise comparisons between subsets rather than direct function evaluations, and the oracle's response is further determined by a transfer function. The authors establish both upper and lower bounds on the achievable error rate. In particular, they proposed algorithms that achieve an error rate of $O(n^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ and $O(n^{7/5}/{T}^{2/5})$, respectively for linear and sigmoid transfer functions. In particular, the achieved error rate under the case of a linear transfer function matches the result of the lower bound.

### Strengths
1. The problem of submodular optimization under the i.i.d. bandit feedback setting has been extensively studied in prior work and has broad applications across various machine learning tasks. In this regard, the paper addresses an important and timely problem of clear relevance to the ICLR community.

2. The authors present a thorough theoretical analysis, deriving both upper and lower bounds on the error rate for the considered setting.
 
3. The proposed algorithm attains the optimal regret bound in the special case of a linear transfer function.

### Weaknesses
1. The problem of submodular optimization under the i.i.d. bandit feedback setting has been studied in many previous works. Compared with existing works, the key assumption is the existence of the transfer function. While the authors provide several motivating examples related to submodular optimization with noisy dueling bandit feedback, it remains unclear how the proposed transfer function appropriately models those scenarios.

 2. The paper does not clearly articulate its technical contributions. It would be helpful for the authors to explicitly emphasize the novel aspects of their analysis. In particular, highlighting the key distinctions from prior work and elaborating on the specific technical challenges addressed would make the theoretical contributions more compelling and substantial.

### Questions
1. Compared to existing work, the main distinguishing feature is the transfer function. Do these assumptions introduce specific technical challenges that must be addressed in the analysis? What are the novel elements in the proofs that arise from these assumptions?

2. For the sigmoid and linear transfer functions, could the authors clarify why these assumptions are reasonable and important in the examples provided? In particular, the linear transfer function appears somewhat impractical, and additional explanation regarding its relevance would be helpful.

### Summary
This work studies submodular function maximization under a new setting where the algorithm does not observe the function values, but only pairwise noisy preferences returned by an oracle. This paper formalizes how duelling responses depend on difference function values through a transfer function (linear, sigmoid etc). For the linear case, the authors propose an SGD-based algorithm using Lvasz extension and show provable optimality, For the sigmoid case, the authors use Firth's bias-correction technique to obtain a theoretical guarantee.

### Strengths
The introduction of the problem.
The hardness of theoretical results is also provided the algorithms are provably optimal. Experimental results give insights are how errors depend on n and T

### Weaknesses
The algorithms heavily rely on continuous extensions. Thus,a concern is overall efficiency of the algorithms could be limited compared to the discrete methods. Is it possible to design algorithms without using the continuous extensions?

The analysis largely adopts techniques from earlier works. How do proof techniques differ>

Presentation could be improved: Adding brief description showing why Algorithm 1 naturally satisfies Restriction 1 could be helpful.

### Questions
Please see the weakness.

### Summary
This work studies submodular function minimization (SMF) with a *dueling oracle* (i.e., an oracle that takes two sets $S$ and $S'$, and
probabilistically returns which set has the higher value with probability $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \rho( f(S) - f(S'))$ for
a fixed *transfer function* $\rho : [-1, 1] \rightarrow [-1, 1]$. A dueling oracle has been used for multi-armed bandit problems
in the context of convex optimization (e.g., [Saha et al., ICML 2021] and [Saha et al., ICML 2025]), but this work is the first to study them for SMF.
The authors give strong upper and lower bounds for the following transfer functions: linear, sigmoid, and general (see Table 1).
Overall, this is a nice and very well written theoretical paper.

### Strengths
- Good classification of upper and lower bounds for SMF for different transfer functions in Table 1.
- Combines a nice set of tools: Lovasz extension (continuous methods), Yao's principle for analysis
- Very well written introduction with motivating applied ML examples in Example 1 and Example 2

### Weaknesses
- Lack of experiments
- Submodular function minimization isn't the strongest fit for ICLR, but there is precidence

### Questions
- [264] How does the randomness of the dueling oracle work? Does it give the
  same noisy response for any given pair of subsets $S$ and $S'$, or are there
  independent coin flips each time the oracle is called?

### Summary
**Main contribution:**
This paper presents the first study of submodular function minimization (SFM) using only a dueling oracle, which provides noisy pairwise comparisons rather than exact function values. The authors propose and analyze algorithms for this setting, establishing error bounds for both linear and sigmoid oracle transfer functions.

**Problem formulation:**
The objective is to minimize a submodular function $f:2^{[n]}\rightarrow[0,1]$, which is a set function satisfying $f(X)+f(Y)\ge f(X\cup Y)+f(X\cap Y)$ for all $X, Y\subseteq[n]$. Access to the function is restricted to a dueling oracle, which, when queried with two sets $(S,S^{\prime})$, returns a random binary response $o\in\{\pm1\}$. The probability of the response is governed by a transfer function $\rho$ based on the value difference, e.g., $Pr(o=+1)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\rho(f(S)-f(S^{\prime}))$. The goal is to minimize the additive error $E_{T}:=f(\hat{S})-min_{S\in2^{[n]}}f(S)$ after $T$ oracle calls.

**Main results**
For a linear transfer function, the paper provides an algorithm with an error rate of $O(n^{\frac{3}{2}}/\sqrt{T})$, which is proven to be optimal for constrained algorithms by a matching lower bound. For a sigmoid transfer function, the authors design an algorithm with an error rate of $O(n^{\frac{7}{5}}/T^{\frac{2}{5}})$.

**Technique/algorithm summary:**
The algorithms are based on applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to the Lovász extention, which is a continuous convex relaxation of the submodular function. In the linear case, an unbiased subgradient estimator for SGD is constructed directly from the dueling oracle's response. Because unbiased estimation is infeasible for the sigmoid function, that algorithm instead employs Firth's method (Firth, 1993) to create a low-bias estimator from the logistic regression model, thereby mitigating error accumulation.

**Experiment summar **
The paper includes numerical experiments that implement the proposed algorithms for both linear and sigmoid transfer functions on submodular cut functions. The result empirically validate the theoretical findings by plotting the error's dependence on the number of oracle calls ($T$) and the ground set size ($n$), showing the data falls between the derived upper and lower bounds.

### Strengths
The theoretical results are solid.

### Weaknesses
Even though this is mainly a theoretical paper, the paper also provides some experimental supports. However, it would be good to provide experiments on some real world data than just numerical experiments.
