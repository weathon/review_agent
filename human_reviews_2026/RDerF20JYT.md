# La-Proteina: Atomistic Protein Generation via Partially Latent Flow Matching

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 8, 10

## Abstract
Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations. Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover, La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples, demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

### Summary
This paper introduces **La-Proteina**, a generative model for the joint design of full-atom protein structures and their sequences.

The key innovation is a **partially latent representation**:
*   The protein backbone is modeled explicitly in 3D space.
*   The sequence and side-chain atoms are captured in fixed-size latent variables.

Using flow matching on this representation, La-Proteina models the joint distribution of sequence and structure. The authors report that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on co-designability and structural validity, surpasses previous methods in motif scaffolding, and uniquely scales to generate proteins up to 800 residues long.

### Strengths
1.  **Innovative Representation for Full-Atom Generation:** The paper proposes a novel partially latent representation for full-atom protein design. By modeling the backbone explicitly while encoding sequence and side-chain information into a fixed-size latent space, the method effectively addresses the long-standing challenge of variable side-chain dimensionality. The application of flow matching to this hybrid representation is a sound and well-motivated approach for modeling the joint distribution.

2.  **Strong Empirical Performance on Key Benchmarks:** The model demonstrates strong performance across a range of challenging tasks. The results indicate state-of-the-art capabilities in both unconditional generation and various motif scaffolding scenarios. A particularly notable result is the model's ability to generate viable proteins up to 800 residues, demonstrating a level of scalability and robustness that surpasses many existing baselines.

3.  **Thorough and Informative Ablation Studies:** The inclusion of extensive ablation studies is a commendable aspect of this work. The authors systematically evaluate the impact of different design choices related to the model architecture, training process, and sampling strategy. This analysis not only supports the paper's conclusions but also provides useful insights for researchers in the field.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Lack of Analysis on Generated Sequence Properties:** For a model that jointly generates full-atom structures and sequences, a notable omission is the characterization of the generated sequence distribution. Prior work in both inverse folding and all-atom generation has shown that models can exhibit significant biases, often over-representing certain amino acids (e.g., Alanine, Glutamate) compared to natural distributions. It is unclear if La-Proteina suffers from a similar sequence bias. An analysis of the amino acid frequencies and other sequence-level properties would be crucial for a complete evaluation of the model's capabilities.

2.  **Potential Confounding Factors in Comparative Evaluation:** The experimental setup in *Table 1* may not provide a fully controlled comparison. La-Proteina was trained on proteins up to 500/800 residues, whereas the baselines were trained on significantly shorter sequences (e.g., APM < 384, Pall-Atom < 128). Evaluating all models on lengths between 100-500 residues means that La-Proteina is largely operating in-distribution, while the baselines are forced to generalize out-of-distribution. This introduces a significant confounding variable (the training data scale and distribution), making it difficult to isolate the true performance benefits of the proposed latent diffusion approach itself. A more compelling comparison would involve evaluating La-Proteina when trained on a dataset of a similar scale to the common baselines.

3.  **Incompleteness in Key Evaluation Metrics:**  While this paper relies on an RMSD threshold for success, other models like APM and Pall-Atom incorporate an additional pLDDT score criterion to ensure that the refolded structures are not only accurate but also predicted with high confidence. The omission of pLDDT analysis is a concern. Could the authors report the distribution of pLDDT scores for the successfully refolded designs?

### Questions
1.  **On the Choice of Training Data (AFDB vs. PDB):** The model was trained exclusively on the AlphaFold Database (AFDB), which consists of predicted structures. Could the authors elaborate on the rationale for not incorporating high-resolution experimental structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which are often considered the gold standard by the structural biology community? What is the authors' perspective on the potential impact of using computationally "distilled" data from AFDB versus empirical data from PDB on the model's learned distribution and its generalization to real-world design tasks?

2.  **On the Performance of a Fully Latent Representation:** It is a very interesting result from the ablation study that a fully latent representation (the CA-enc. variant) leads to a significant degradation in performance. Do the authors have a deeper analysis or intuition for this phenomenon? In the generation trajectories of other state-of-the-art models (e.g., Pall-Atom, AlphaFold 3), it is often observed that the backbone structure emerges from the noise before the side-chains are fully resolved, even when the model architecture treats them jointly. Does the failure of the fully latent variant in this work suggest a fundamental difficulty in coupling the degrees of freedom for both backbone and side-chains into a single, unified latent space? 

3.  **On Modeling Long-Range Side-Chain Interactions:** *Figure 8* suggests that the VAE's latent representation for side-chains is predominantly local. Given that long-range interactions between side-chains are critical for protein folding, stability, and function, how does the proposed partial-latent modeling framework ensure these non-local dependencies are captured? Unlike methods that explicitly model all atoms in a global context, it is not immediately clear how this is achieved here. Are there specific case studies or quantitative metrics that can demonstrate the model's ability to generate plausible long-range side-chain interaction networks?

### Summary
La-Proteina introduces a partially latent flow matching framework for joint protein sequence and full-atom structure generation. The key idea is to model the protein backbone explicitly (using α-carbon coordinates) while encoding all side-chain atoms and sequence information in a fixed-size latent vector per residue. This hybrid representation avoids the combinatorial complexity of direct discrete side-chain modeling and enables powerful continuous generative dynamics on the backbone+latent space. The authors first train a VAE to map proteins (sequence plus structure) into the per-residue latent space and back, then train a flow-matching model (a form of diffusion) to jointly generate new backbone coordinates and latent vectors. They claim the following major contributions and results: 

**(1)** A novel partially-latent protein generative model that combines explicit backbone modeling with latent side-chain+sequence representation. 

**(2)** State-of-the-art performance on unconditional protein generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in co-designability (ability to jointly fold sequence+structure), diversity, and structural quality. 

**(3)** Unique scalability to very long proteins: La-Proteina can generate plausible 800-residue designs where other all-atom models run out of memory or collapse (essentially failing beyond 500 residues). 

**(4)** Successful demonstration of fully atomistic motif scaffolding: given a small active-site motif (set of residues with known 3D arrangement), La-Proteina can build new proteins that accurately incorporate that motif. This holds even in the challenging “unindexed” setting where the motif’s position in the sequence is not specified. The model outperforms previous scaffolding approaches (which were limited to backbone-only or indexed placement) and solves most tasks in a standard benchmark. 

**(5)** Extensive analyses are provided: ablation studies show the importance of design choices, and structural evaluations indicate that La-Proteina’s samples are substantially more physically realistic than those of prior all-atom models.

### Strengths
- The proposed representation elegantly addresses a core difficulty in protein generation: the mixed discrete (sequence) and continuous (structure) nature with variable side-chain sizes. By encoding side-chain atoms and amino acid type into a fixed continuous latent per residue, La-Proteina avoids having to explicitly model discrete sequence choices and variable atom counts during generation. This is a novel solution not seen in prior protein diffusion models, which either treated all atoms explicitly (incurring huge complexity) or attempted fully latent approaches. The authors demonstrate that this hybrid strategy retains crucial backbone information explicitly while deferring fine atom details to a learned latent space – an approach supported by ablations (if the backbone is also put in latent, performance drops sharply). This design is well-motivated and grounded in prior successes in related domains (e.g. latent diffusions in image generation) and backbone-only protein modeling, but extends them in a non-trivial way for the joint sequence–structure task. By leveraging flow matching (a deterministic counterpart of diffusion) on this simplified space, the method can generate proteins end-to-end while maintaining high fidelity in both structure and sequence, as confirmed by the VAE’s excellent reconstruction (0.12Å all-atom RMSD, 100% sequence recovery).

- State-of-the-Art Unconditional Generation Performance: La-Proteina convincingly achieves SOTA results on standard protein design metrics. On the all-atom unconditional generation benchmark (100–500 residue range), it outperforms a slate of recent models like P(all-atom), APM, PLAID, ProteinGenerator, Protpardelle and Protpardelle-1c, in nearly every metric. In particular, La-Proteina’s designs have dramatically higher co-designability (e.g. 68–75% vs ~9–37% for baselines) and designability scores, showing that its jointly generated sequences truly fold into the generated structures with high fidelity. It also produces orders-of-magnitude more diverse structures (clustering yields ~180–216 unique clusters vs tens for others) without sacrificing novelty. Importantly, structural realism is superior: La-Proteina’s samples have far better MolProbity scores than baseline outputs. Additionally, La-Proteina accurately reproduces the distribution of side-chain dihedral angles (rotamers) seen in natural protein databases. Prior methods often missed certain rotamer states or had incorrect preferences, whereas La-Proteina’s generated residues match reference distributions almost perfectly. These results support the authors’ claim of overall superior quality. The evaluation is extensive, and the improvements are significant. Notably, La-Proteina even surpasses the previous state-of-the-art “Proteina” backbone-only method on its own terms it in fact excels, presumably due to the integrated training of sequence+structure rather than sequential design.


- A standout strength is La-Proteina’s ability to handle much larger proteins than competing methods. The paper demonstrates the generation of proteins up to 800 residues (close to the upper limit in their training set) that remain co-designable, diverse, and physically plausible. All baseline all-atom models failed catastrophically in this regime (e.g. many “collapsed” and produced no co-designable samples beyond 400–500 residues). Empirically, using the same hardware that couldn’t generate a single 600-residue sample for P(all-atom) (a 140GB GPU), La-Proteina comfortably generates 800-residue proteins. The samples are not only valid but high-quality at those lengths. It should be noted that this success is in part due to engineering choices: the authors trained on an enormous dataset of ~46 million structures (AlphaFold DB) to expose the model to long proteins.

### Weaknesses
- A notable limitation is that La-Proteina is only demonstrated on single-chain proteins, whereas many real design tasks involve multi-chain complexes or protein–protein interactions. The authors explicitly acknowledge this as future work. While focusing on monomers is reasonable for a first step (and they already handle up to 800 residues in one chain), it means the method currently cannot design binding interfaces or multi-subunit assemblies. Competing approaches have introduced multi-chain generation modes (e.g. for homomers or heteromers). Not testing La-Proteina on complexes is a missed opportunity to show generality. It is unclear how easily the model could be extended to complexes (with potentially even larger lengths), which could be challenging. The authors’ own Limitations section notes that protein assemblies and interfaces were not addressed, which are crucial for tasks like binder design. Thus, the work, while strong for monomer design, falls short on multi-chain design which remains an open challenge.

- La-Proteina’s impressive performance comes at the cost of very large-scale training. The model was trained on 46 million structure-sequence pairs (essentially the entire high-quality samples of AlphaFold DB) using 128×80GB GPUs, a heavy computational load. This far exceeds the training dataset sizes of most baselines (many prior models used on the order of 0.1–1 million PDB-derived examples). While the ability to leverage massive data is a plus for performance, it raises concerns of reproducibility and fairness of comparison. Some of La-Proteina’s gains might come from sheer dataset scale and network size, rather than purely algorithmic superiority. It’s plausible that if others had similar GPU budgets or training data, the gap might narrow. The authors do mention that P(all-atom) and others are constrained by architecture from scaling to AF2 data, which justifies their approach. However, from a practical standpoint, not all researchers can train on tens of millions of samples. The paper would be stronger if it discussed how performance scales with data (e.g. is a subset of 1M or 10M sufficient to beat baselines?). Is it because of the new architecture or simply training on an unprecedented dataset?

- As with most computational design papers, this work stops at in silico metrics. A natural question is whether La-Proteina’s designs are actually foldable and functional in vitro. The paper does not include any experimental assay or even Rosetta energy minimization analysis to check stability. While such validation is beyond the scope of ICLR, it means the ultimate utility is inferred rather than proven. For example, co-designability uses ESMFold (a fast structure predictor) to verify that the sequence can fold into the model’s structure. This is a reasonable proxy, but ESMFold is not as accurate as AlphaFold2 on novel sequences; some false positives/negatives could occur. The model might generate sequences that fool ESMFold but would not truly fold (or vice versa). Also, MolProbity scores being good is encouraging, yet those are still computed on the designed models themselves. Without relaxation or physics-based evaluation, we don’t know if slight clashes would resolve or if the designs have hidden strain. Functionally, the motif scaffolding examples are promising (they preserved active-site geometries), but the paper doesn’t test if the enzymes would actually be active, that would require molecular dynamics or lab experiments. Again, this is not expected in a CS-focused venue, but it’s a gap to be aware of. One could imagine that certain subtleties (like global stability or kinetic foldability) are not captured by the metrics used. This is a general weakness of the field rather than this paper specifically, but since the authors tout “fully atomistic high-quality structures,” an expert might ask for a bit more evidence (e.g. computing Rosetta folding stability or sequence conservation analysis). The paper does perform a rotamer analysis and secondary structure content check, which are good sanity checks. However, one missing evaluation I note is any measure of thermodynamic stability or model confidence for the generated proteins. For example, methods like AlphaFold2 or Rosetta Relax could be used on the designed sequence to see if it strongly prefers the designed structure. Co-designability partly does this (AlphaFold via ESMFold), but reporting an average pLDDT could add insight. In summary, the lack of real-world validation is a weakness insofar as the paper’s claims rest on proxy metrics. This is not a fatal flaw for an ML paper, but it means the true impact (e.g. designing a new enzyme from scratch) is still unproven.

### Questions
- How do you envision extending La-Proteina to design protein complexes or multi-chain assemblies? Since your current model represents one continuous chain with per-residue latents, would handling multiple chains simply be a matter of adding chain-break tokens or separate latent sequences per chain? Are there any obstacles (e.g. interfacing latents between chains, increased length) that you foresee? For instance, could the flow matching scale to, say, a heterodimer of 2×400 residues (total 800) as easily as a single 800-res chain?


- Your training set of 46M samples is enormous. Did you observe how performance scales with fewer training examples or smaller models? For example, if only the PDB (~0.5M structures) were used, does La-Proteina still outperform baselines? Similarly, how crucial is the 130M parameter Transformer architecture? It would help to know if the method could work on more limited data/resources (perhaps with reduced output quality but still above prior methods). Any insight on the data efficiency (like learning curves) would be valuable for researchers who cannot train at that massive scale.


- Have you tried a two-stage approach as a baseline, e.g., first generate a backbone with your flow model (ignoring latents), then design sequence/side-chains using an external model (like ProteinMPNN)? Essentially, how much do we gain by co-generating sequence and structure together, versus sequentially? Your results suggest co-generation is superior (given the high co-designability vs baseline designability), but a direct comparison would confirm the benefit of coupling. If not explicitly tested, what’s your intuition: is the improvement mostly because the model can adjust backbone positions to accommodate sequence mutations on the fly (something a sequential process can’t do)?


- You report almost all samples are valid/co-designable and even tricky motifs are scaffolded well. Did you notice any recurring failure modes or patterns in the rare cases where La-Proteina fails? For example, in Figure 11 you show one inconsistency (a rotated ring) in a motif placement. Are such errors random, or do they happen more for certain residue types or structural contexts (e.g. certain ligand-binding motifs or β-sheet-rich motifs)? Understanding when the model struggles could guide future improvements. Additionally, during generation, do you ever get completely broken structures (e.g. chains that don’t fold into a single globule, or severe steric clashes)? If so, how do you detect or filter those? Overall the error rates seem low, but any insight into “edge cases” would be helpful.


- Your diversity and novelty metrics indicate many unique structures are generated, but the average TM-score to known structures is ~0.75, implying the samples are still reminiscent of known folds. Can you provide qualitative examples of how novel the top designs are? For instance, have you found any new topologies (combinations of secondary structure never or rarely seen in PDB)? It would be reassuring to see that La-Proteina isn’t just reproducing common motifs in protein structure (like αα-hairpins, helix-loop-helix, etc.) but can also generate creative arrangements. If you haven’t assessed this, do you plan to? Perhaps tools like Foldseek or manual inspection could identify if any design is a true outlier relative to the training set. This will shed light on the model’s ability to extrapolate versus interpolate known protein geometry.


- Following up on the lack of experimental tests, do you intend to collaborate or perform wet-lab validation of some La-Proteina designs? For example, taking a few long designs or motif scaffolds and expressing them to see if they fold and function. Given the model’s strengths, it seems poised to attempt de novo enzyme design or binder creation. If not already in progress, what would be the first application you’d target with La-Proteina (e.g. designing a new enzyme for a reaction by scaffolding a catalytic motif, or creating a large megadalton protein cage, etc.)? Any discussion on how well the in silico metrics correlate with experimental success (perhaps referencing prior work) would help set expectations for readers interested in deploying these designs.


If the authors address the weaknesses outlined above, or provide a right justification for the points raised in my questions, or clarify points I may have misunderstood, I would be willing to raise my score from 8 to 10.

### Summary
This paper introduces La-Proteina, which addresses the protein codesign problem. La-Proteina tackles this via a "partially latent" representation. The C-alpha backbone coordinates are modeled explicitly, while the sequence identity and all other atomistic details are compressed into fixed-size, per-residue latent variables using a VAE. A scalable flow matching model that circumvents triangular update layers learns the joint distribution in this hybrid explicit-latent space. This also allows separation of generation processes for the coordinates and latents, which allows different generation schedules during inference. Empirically, La-Proteina achieves SOTA on co-designability and diversity benchmarks. The model also does well on long-sequence generation up to 800 residues. Additional conditional capabilities are demonstrated, including motif scaffolding without pre-specifying the positions.

### Strengths
1. Strong empirical performance across the board.
2. Hybrid representation with the partially latent dimension is thoughtful. It allocates enough resolution to the key backbone portion while circumventing the issue of needing to pre-specify the number of atoms.
3. Biophysical evaluations are compelling; examining for clash rates and rotamer frequencies sets a new evaluation metric that is meaningful for this subfield.
4. The technical ability to decouple the timesteps necessary is thoughtfully designed, and the evidence for the argument that backbones require fewer inference timesteps than latent is illuminating.
5. Unindexed motif scaffolding is a more meaningful conditional task, great to see it included.

### Weaknesses
* A short coming of having two noise schedules is that we now need to tune two noise schedules – authors were able to get good results regardless, but this is a small concern for practical usage.
* Not so much specific to this paper, but generally conditional generation becomes much more interesting than pure unconditional generation. Would strengthen the paper if more of the work was focused on that aspect.

### Questions
* AFAICT, the 8-dimension latent space does not report ablations. It would be interesting to better understand this dimensionality choice, especially considering the fact that we have some ground truth knowledge of the average number of atoms in a sidechain residue. Was this chosen based on ablations or intuition?

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel partial latent flow matching for full-atom protein generation. They encode varying-length side chains and categorical residue types into the latent space, and maintain the explicit $\alpha$-carbon-based protein backbone representation in the coordinate space. They achieve SOTA performance on unconditional and conditional full-atom protein generation benchmarks.

### Strengths
The motivation is reasonable, proteins' natural hierarchical structure (backbone + side chains) and variable-length side chains are suitable for partial latent generation. 

The method is presented clearly; training and inference hyperparameters are provided for reproducibility. 

The experimental part is well-designed, and they achieve SOTA results on unconditional and conditional full-atom protein generation benchmarks. They also provide many ablation and analysis experiments to support their method.

### Weaknesses
**W1. The La-Proteina model has only been trained and tested on monomeric proteins. Can it be trained or fine-tuned on multi-chain data (protein complex design), such as APM[1]?**

**W2. Folding can be regarded as a kind of conditional full-atom generation. Can La-Proteina compare on the folding benchmark?**

**Q1. Both equivariant rigidity-based methods like FrameFlow[1] or FoldFlow[2], or non-equivariant methods in coordinate space like Proteina or La-Proteina ($\alpha$-carbon), all use a fast scheduler during the inference to ensure the quality of generated proteins. Do you have any insights or possible explanations for this phenomenon?**
