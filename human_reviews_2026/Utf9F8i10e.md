# From geometry to dynamics: Learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse observations with geometric constraints

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
How can we learn the laws underlying the dynamics of stochastic systems when their trajectories are sampled sparsely in time? Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover.

Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by structure in the system’s invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from severely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods, with broad applications across physics, biology, and control.

### Summary
This paper proposes a geometry-aware EM framework for learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse temporal observations. The authors propose a novel, geometry-aware inference framework that formulates the problem as one of stochastic control.

The method combines:

1. Approximating the Riemannian metric from observations and constructing geodesics.
2. Using these geodesics as soft constraints to guide a path augmentation (diffusion bridge sampling) step, which reconstructs a likely continuous-time trajectory.
3. This augmented path is then used within an Expectation-Maximisation framework to infer the system's drift function via Gaussian Process (GP) regression. 

The approach is evaluated on four 2D synthetic dynamical systems.

### Strengths
1. **Incorporating geometry** - Using geometry to regularise temporal inference is a relevant idea, and the paper effectively leverages it for sparse SDE identification
2. **Soundness of formulation** - The overall stochastic control + GP inference framework is coherent and conceptually bridges geometric learning, Schrödinger bridges, and system identification
3. **Relevance** - Sparse-sampling identification of physical systems is a real-world problem and the proposed setup is well-motivated within that context

### Weaknesses
1. **Synthetic, low-dim scope** - All evaluations are 2D toy examples; no real-world or higher-dimensional experiments are presented, raising questions about practical significance
2. **Positioning** - The proposed geodesic-based augmentation step appears very close in spirit to Generalized Schrödinger Bridge Matching (GSBM) and especially Metric Flow Matching (MFM) [1], which already learn and use data-dependent metrics and geodesic interpolants (Eqs. 2–3 in the paper being reviewed). The core geometric contribution of this paper thus appears to overlapwith MFM yet this is not acknowledged.
3. **Lack of ablations** - No sensitivity analysis with respect to the learned metric quality. No comparison or ablation replacing the first step (geometry + bridging) with GSBM or MFM. This would isolate the true contribution of the proposed path augmentation scheme versus these other geodesic-based interpolators.
4. **Scalability and Significance** -  The method's scalability is a significant concern. The use of Gaussian Processes for drift inference, even in its sparse form (as mentioned in the Appendix), limits the practical application to very low-dimensional systems and thus potential impact.
5. **Presentation** - The paper contains several editing issues: ,issing implementation details on the metric, typo in Fig. 1D (“obsevrations”), text occluded around line 244, and inconsistent or missing bolding of best results in Table 1. They reduce readability and professionalism.

### Questions
1. **Positioning** - Could the authors explicitly position their method against GSBM and MFM, and possibly include ablations or replacements using these existing geometric bridge formulations for the first step?
2. **Real-world relevance** - What are the real systems that method could be applied for? Following in that case, could the authors provide empirical evidence?
3. **Scalability** - Given the complexity of the GP, do the authors foresee this being a limiting factor for real world applications? What would be the alternative here?

### Summary
The authors proposed a new method that leverage both information from path invariant metric to better infer drift of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with low sampling rate. The method resembles an EM algorithm that in step 1 it infers the possible path between observations and in step 2 the algorithm estimates drift.

### Strengths
The method leveraged multiple source of information in a way to some extend convincing. 
The geometric constrains potentially provides a way to share information among paths if multiple are observed, as oppose to e.g., latent SDE that not quite share information among multiple paths. 
The test results appear good in some cases.

### Weaknesses
- Since the algorithm is trying to use invariant metric as a source of information, which needs to be estimated from the samples on one path --- this requires the pooled sample to faithfully reproduce invariant metric. As the authors' results suggested in the out of equilibrium system the method can fail. 
- The mathematical justification is a bit weak, but heuristics like this work has value.

### Questions
- Can the author clarify a bit more how they method compare to latent SDE with some geometric informed prior process? Or an alternative fitting procedure with 1) do latent SDE to fill in observations with an initial prior drift 2) use the filled path to fit drift and use that as the prior drift in latent SDE again?
- Can the author clarify where they think the gain is coming from? Is it from geometric constrain or fitting the invariant metric. E.g., suppose I am willing to assume drift is a gradient field then fitting the invariant metric would give us a lot of information about the drift itself but geometric constrain might not be?

### Summary
The paper proposes methods to solve for the underlying time-homogenous drift $f(X)$ of a system driven by Langevin dynamics with diffusion $\sigma$ from observed samples.  The authors propose to first estimate a Riemannian metric from the observed samples and construct geodesics between observed time points.   These geodesic paths are used to augment a stochastic optimal control problem between adjacent timepoints with a state-cost on generated trajectories which penalizes distance from calculated geodesics.   Gaussian process inference is used to update estimates of the drift across iterations.

### Strengths
The paper frames the problem well, gives extensive references to temporal and geometric methods, and provides results across a range of settings.    Thus, the proposed geometric constraints are well motivated (although the exposition in App C regarding Onsager-Machlup is not referenced anywhere in the main text, cf. L417).   The paper uses simulation with a learned drift & geometric constraints to improve upon Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridges in previous work Batz et. al 2018.   

The authors show promising experimental result in four systems of interest.   The method outperforms several baselines, demonstrates some robustness to diffusion coefficient misspecification, and improves performance with high stochasticity and high inter-observation time.

### Weaknesses
The paper is lacking in detail to understand the proposed method.    For example, 
- the optimal control cost is relegated to Eq. 37 on pg. 24 of the Appendix.   
- the interacting particle system from Maoutsa and Opper 2021a for solving the control problem is not explained, as far as I can tell
- it is not clear how to accurately estimate the $q_t(x)$ appearing in the solution in Eq. 7 (unless this is intended as the equation below Eq. 42), or how this was derived.
- "We employ a sample-based approximation of the densities in Eq. 38 ($Q_f$) resulting from the particle sampling of the path measure $Q$" (L1328, pg. 25) requires more detailed explanation.
- to what extent are the boundary constraints enforced by the solutions to the stochastic control problem in step $\beta$?
- the EM algorithm is deferred to Eq. 19-20 (pg 20-21), although the procedure is basic and components are suggested by the main text.   Nevertheless, I feel this simple statement would help ground the explanation of the method.
    - presumably, $\hat{f}$ is obtained using the updated drift estimate in step $\gamma$, but this fact and the procedure for obtaining $\hat{f}$ from Eq 7 is not clear in the main text.

I would greatly appreciate an algorithm box specifying steps of the algorithm and links to Appendix sections and/or Eq. numbers explaining details.    I was able to find a workshop version of this paper online, and while details were still lacking, I appreciated the probabilistic statements and context throughout that version of the work.  



 The authors might consider citing and comparing with Kapuśniak et. al (NeurIPS 2024) "Metric flow matching for smooth interpolations on the data manifold".   Generalized Schrodinger Bridge Matching (Liu et. al 2023) and Wasserstein Lagrangian Flow (Neklyudov et. al 2023) would also be relevant baselines (where couplings could be given by same-trajectory samples and the state-cost is using the proposed distance-to-geodesic).

Minor comments;

- Line 244 is cut off by the figure.
- It is unclear to which experimental setting Fig 3 and L356-372 refer
- please be clear about the bold- and non-bold notation for $\mathcal{O}$ (e.g. Eq 2).   Presumably, we want to construct geodesics between non-bold $\mathcal{O}_k$ (i.e. same-trajectory samples from the bolded set)?

### Questions
My immediate questions are mostly regarding details of the method above, where lack of clarity in exposition is a primary weakness of the current submission.

### Summary
The paper introduces a geometry-aware path augmentation framework for learning overdamped Langevin dynamics from sparse snapshots. It first learns a Riemannian metric from the data invariant density, computes geodesics between observations, and then samples diffusion bridges constrained to remain near those geodesics. The authors apply proposed method to model stochastic systems, providing results across synthetic and real-world examples.

### Strengths
* **Motivation**: The authors provide a comprehensive overview motivating modeling stochastic processes in the abstract and introduction, makes it easy for reader who is new to the field to understand the theoretical background behind problem formulation
* **Geometric-aware method**: Novel geometric-aware method that is combined with diffusion bridges and control cost
* **Modeling non-conservative dynamics**: Authors specifically target system that exhibit non-conservative forces and show results on a range of stochastic settings

### Weaknesses
* **Problem formulation**: The introduction should clearly state problem formulation, summarizing limitations of prior approaches to learning stochastic dynamics (e.g., [1], [2], [3]), geometry-guided methods (e.g., [4]), and then state how the proposed method differs and  in which cases it outperforms these baselines. For example, this would add more value than a description below Figure 1 (which could be included as main text in shorter form and extended in appendix)
* **Existing work**: The work compares results to a limited set of baselines. I would suggest authors to include performance comparisons between proposed methods and baselines that operate by learning metric and/or inferring dynamics from sparse observations. Namely [4] learns Riemannian metrics to construct neural interpolates between end-points, [2] includes control cost and [1] and [3] operate in the stochastic setting. I understand that authors discuss some of these in related work and appendix (namely [2]), however it would be beneficial to include numerical experiments showing differences in empirical performance in the main text. Further it would be good to compare to computational cost across baselines.
* **Methodology and background**: I would suggest expanding theoretical background and methodology in lines 227-290, to improve clarity behind proposed method. Further it would be useful to provide algorithms behind each of the components.

### Questions
* Line 134 states that the problem reduces to low-dimensional manifold in case of invariant density. Could you provide some further theoretical clarity behind this?
* How do you construct the bridges in multi marginal setting?
* How do you learn drift control term and drift estimate given the Riemannian set-up?
* Minor comment, but I believe sentence in line 243 is cut off by a figure?
