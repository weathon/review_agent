# Federated Causal Inference on Multi-Site Observational Data via Propensity Score Aggregation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 6

## Abstract
Causal inference typically assumes centralized access to individual-level data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites, making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal constraints. We address this problem by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from decentralized observational data via a Federated Learning (FL) approach, allowing inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than individual-level data.
    We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores by computing a federated weighted average of local scores with Membership Weights (MW)—probabilities of site membership conditional on covariates—which can be flexibly estimated using parametric or non-parametric classification models. 
    Unlike density ratio weights (DW) from the transportability and generalization literature, which either rely on strong modeling assumptions or cannot be implemented in FL, MW can be estimated using standard FL algorithms and are more robust, as they support flexible, non-parametric models—making them the preferred choice in multi-site settings with strict data-sharing constraints.
    The resulting propensity scores are used to construct Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting (Fed-IPW) and Augmented IPW (Fed-AIPW) estimators.
    Unlike meta-analysis methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach leverages heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. 
    We show that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data highlight their advantages over meta-analysis and related methods.

### Summary
This work presents a way to perform federated learning of average treatment effects. Its main novelty over existing results in the literature is to directly estimate membership weight nuisance, rather indirectly estimating it through density functions. I agree with the authors that this approach - which estimates as simple a nuisances as possible - appears to be the ideal approach.

The identifiability results and efficiency guarantees seem to follow standard arguments.

### Strengths
Estimating the densities used to define the nuisance is impractical: it requires tackling a harder statistical estimation problem than is necessary, and, if the densities are estimated flexibly, also requires sharing too much data across sites to classify as a "federated learning" approach. Estimating membership weights avoids these issues.

### Weaknesses
By Bayes' rule, $\omega_k^{\textnormal{DW}}(x)=\omega_k^{\textnormal{MW}}(x)$, so I'm unclear why different notation is being used for the two sets of weights. My understanding of your contribution is that you directly estimate the weight, rather than estimating the three components---$\rho_k,f_k,f$---used in the first representation. But the presentation obscures that.

The general idea to re-express weights in terms of source membership probabilities is commonly used in the data fusion / generalizability / transportability literatures. E.g., in slightly different problems than the one considered:

* Cole, Stephen R., and Elizabeth A. Stuart. "Generalizing evidence from randomized clinical trials to target populations: the ACTG 320 trial." American journal of epidemiology 172.1 (2010): 107-115.
* Westreich, Daniel, et al. "Transportability of trial results using inverse odds of sampling weights." American journal of epidemiology 186.8 (2017): 1010-1014.

Overall the contribution seems marginal to me. The identifiability and efficiency results are standard, so the only improvement over standard practice seems to be how one nuisance is estimated.

### Questions
Sorry if I'm missing something, but should Assumption 2 also condition on site ($H$)? Otherwise I don't see why Assumptions 1 and 2 together would yield $E[Y|X,W=w,H=k]=E[Y|X,W=w,H=k']$ as claimed on line 144.

### Summary
This paper studies average treatment effect (ATE) estimation from decentralized multi-site observational data. The core idea is to form a global propensity score as a weighted mixture of site-specific propensity scores, with weights learned as membership probabilities via federated training; the resulting score is used in Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW estimators. The paper shows oracle equivalence to centralized estimators, variance advantages over meta-analysis under local overlap, and improved global overlap, and provides simulations and a Traumabase data application. Empirical story is promising and exposition is clear, but the conceptual novelty beyond prior federated causal work feels incremental and several modeling choices and assumptions (especially “ignorability on sites”) should be relaxed or at least examined via sensitivity analysis procedures.

### Strengths
1. Practical and easily understandable by implementers. The 2-step pipeline (local PS at each site + federated membership weights) can be implemented with off-the-shelf tools; works even when some sites have poor/zero local overlap.

2. Simulations and a 14-site real dataset indicate the approach works and outperforms simple meta-analysis in variance and robustness.

### Weaknesses
1. Outcome modeling and AIPW components mirror prior work (e.g., Khellaf et al.) and the membership-weight mixture of local PS, while sensible, feels like a straightforward extension; the paper needs crisper positioning against center-effect / concept shift and transportability literatures and federated PS aggregation (e.g., parameter or consensus / voting approaches)

2. Estimating local PS's P(H=k | X=x) can be problematic when many sites have this probability close to 0; common in multi-institution data. The paper acknowledges density-ratio issues but underplays analogous small-probability problems and potential co-training or regularization strategies.

3. Real-data models (logistic PS, FedAvg logistic outcomes; a 1-hidden-layer, 128-unit NN for MW) seem overly simplistic

4. No reference to code or proofs; no appendix.

### Questions
* How would the DAG change if you have center-level covariates, and how would nuisance models be estimated potentially differently as a result? I believe that you could have weaker assumptions leveraging center-level covariates that could then allow for a direct arrow from H to Y. Alternatively, would it be sufficient to assume (Y(0), Y(1) \perp W | (H,X) or a mixed structure (e.g., random intercepts) and show when your Fed-(A)IPW remains consistent? What sensitivity analysis do you recommend if Assumption 2 fails?

* What happens when some local PS models are misspecified and the MW classifier can also be misspecified? Theoretical results for rate-double-robust style guarantees (e.g., products of estimation errors) for Fed-AIPW in the federated setting would be helpful.

* Instead of training K independent PS models, can you co-train subsets of sites that are similar (multi-task or clustered FL) and mix only across clusters? How would that change variance and bias? 

* Any theory comparing the asymptotic efficiency of Fed-(A)IPW to (i) the best single-site estimator and (ii) pooled oracle, beyond the variance comparisons to meta-analysis?

### Summary
This paper introduces a federated approach for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from decentralized observational data without sharing individual-level records. The authors propose Federated IPW (Fed-IPW) and Federated AIPW (Fed-AIPW) estimators that aggregate locally estimated propensity scores using Membership Weights (MW)—the probability of site membership conditional on covariates. Compared to density ratio weighting (DW) methods from transportability literature, MW can be flexibly estimated via standard federated learning algorithms using either parametric or nonparametric models, thereby improving overlap and robustness.
The paper provides theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed estimators attain the same efficiency as centralized ones, outperform meta-analysis under weaker overlap assumptions, and empirically validate the method on both synthetic and real datasets (Traumabase).

### Strengths
1. Federated causal inference is an important emerging area where privacy-preserving data analysis meets causal estimation. The paper correctly identifies limitations of current meta-analysis and density-ratio-based approaches and proposes a plausible solution.

2. The proposed Membership Weight aggregation is mathematically well-defined, with clear derivations showing variance reduction (Theorems 3–5) and improved overlap. The proofs appear sound and the arguments are intuitive (e.g., the toy example on page 6 clearly demonstrates the “global overlap improvement” effect).

3. The simulations across varying overlap regimes (no, poor, good local overlap) convincingly illustrate that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW remain unbiased and stable even when meta-analysis fails (Figures 2–4).

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of in-depth discussion between prior work. The contribution mainly lies in the MW-based aggregation strategy. While elegant, it largely builds on existing AIPW/IPW machinery and the federated estimation literature. I personally feel that the method proposed in the paper is very closely related to prior work by Guo et al. (2024). Although they considered estimating the ATE w.r.t. the target distribution. When taking the target distribution as the entire population, the two proposed estimators look similar.

2. Empirical analysis could be deeper:

- The synthetic experiments mainly vary overlap conditions but do not explore heterogeneity in nuisance models (e.g., nonlinear treatment mechanisms or site-specific confounding structures).

- The real-data example (Traumabase) is informative but somewhat limited: the analysis is primarily AIPW-based with simple logistic regressions. It would be useful to examine nonparametric MW models more thoroughly or report sensitivity to misspecification.

3. Assumption 2 (ignorability on sites) seems strong: In realistic federated healthcare scenarios, site membership may directly affect outcomes (e.g., hospital quality or local protocols). There exists literature in Meta-analysis that uses L1-regulizer style estimator to deal with this issue. It is worthwhile to incorporating that in the setting.

### Questions
Can the authors compare their estimators and the estimators in Guo et al. (2024), when their target site becomes the super-population defined by the K participating sites?
