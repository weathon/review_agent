# Exploratory Causal Inference in SAEnce

- Decision: Accept (Oral)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 4

## Abstract
Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a Sparse Auto Encoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce _Neural Effect Search_, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

### Summary
The paper proposes Exploratory Causal Inference. Starting from raw, high-dimensional measurements $X$ collected in randomized trials where the specific outcome variables $Y$ are unknown, the authors extract representations with a foundation model (FM), reparameterize them with a sparse autoencoder (SAE), and then test for treatment effects at the level of SAE codes. They identify a core failure mode, the paradox of exploratory causal inference, where classical multiple testing (even with Bonferroni/FDR) flags all entangled neurons as “significant” as sample size or effect size grows, destroying interpretability. To address this, they introduce Neural Effect Search (NES), a recursive, arm-wise residual stratification procedure that peels away effects one by one and (under assumptions) consistently recovers the true effect subspace. They present semi-synthetic experiments (CelebA-based) and a real randomized ecology trial (ISTAnt ants) where NES identifies a behavior (grooming) and a nuisance/background correlate.

### Strengths
Originality. The manuscript frames an under-explored empiricist alternative to “prediction-powered” causal inference by discovering what was affected (unknown $Y$) rather than who is affected (heterogeneity over $W$). The formal paradox and its asymptotics represent a crisp conceptual advance that explains why usual multi-testing fails under entanglement.

Quality. The NES procedure is simple, causally motivated (conditioning/stratification to remove leakage and collider bias), and backed by a consistency theorem under a clear SCM. The proofs (appendix) show how arm-wise residualization preserves the remaining causal contrasts. 

Clarity. Pipeline and problem setting are clearly contrasted with classical RCTs and “prediction-powered” approaches. Figures and toy examples clearly communicate the paradox and the proposed fix.
 
Significance. If validated more broadly, NES could become a practical hypothesis-generation and pruning layer for large, instrumented experiments (biology, ecology, imaging, etc.), reducing annotation burden while keeping statistical guardrails. The empirical ecology case shows it can recover a known behavior (grooming) and also surface a background artifact that informs experimental redesign.

### Weaknesses
Identification hinges on SAE/FM assumptions. Consistency requires that the true effect directions live (approximately linearly) in the SAE code space and that the SAE reaches a sufficiently mono-semantic regime. This is acknowledged as the biggest limitation in the manuscript. The paper would benefit from stress tests across different FM/SAE choices, sparsity regimes, and code dimensionalities, plus diagnostics for “are we in a regime where NES is trustworthy?” (e.g., leakage indices before/after NES and stability under code re-initialization). 

NES uses Bonferroni within rounds, but the recursion adaptively selects and conditions on previous picks. The theorem covers recovery of directions under asymptotics. However, finite-sample error rates (FWER/FDR) across the entire procedure remain unclear. The authors are suggested to quantify family-wise error or provide a selective-inference style bound for the full recursion (or a practical stopping rule tied to post-selection adjusted p-values). 

The toy setups are helpful but narrow. The authors may consider adding settings with (i) multiple effects with very different magnitudes; (ii) nonlinear superposition in codes; (iii) batch effects and arm imbalance; (iv) mis-specified FMs (domain shift). It would be helpful to report precision/recall/IoU when ground-truth effects are weak and overlapping, and ablate stratification choices.

The real trial yields two neurons; one aligns with grooming ($F1\approx0.40$), another with palette background correlated with treatment due to small $n$. This convincingly demonstrates hypothesis surfacing, but decisions based on neural codes remain risky. Strengthen the case with expert-verified labeling for the surfaced codes (beyond top clips), pre-registered confirmatory tests, or a hold-out colony/day to show replicability.

### Questions
1.	Can you characterize the overall FWER/FDR of the entire recursive NES (not just within-round Bonferroni)? Any feasible post-selection correction or stability-selection variant?
2.	What quantitative leakage/entanglement metrics do you compute pre- and post-NES? Can you report these alongside effect discoveries to guide practitioners? E.g., your leakage set/index definition as a reported diagnostic.
3.	How stable are discovered effects across different FMs (e.g., DINOv2 vs. CLIP/SigLIP), code sizes, sparsity penalties, and random seeds? Any consensus-NES idea where you intersect effects across runs?
4.	In the ecology study, could you provide bootstrap confidence intervals for NES effect sizes on residualized codes, or permutation tests that respect the randomization?
5.	Beyond “stop when no rejections,” is there any data-dependent stopping that protects against over-peeling? And for multiple effects, how robust is the ordering (largest first) under moderate entanglement?
6.	Could NES results predict downstream manual labels or behavioral rates on an unseen experimental batch, thereby validating discovered effects?

### Summary
The authors focus on an empiricist, rather than rationalist, approach to analyzing data from RCTs.  The increase in large data collections opens up a increasing range of datasets where interventions were performed without clear hypotheses or outcome targets.  In such domains, it can be useful to explore the space of possible outcomes for a given treatment, but the high dimensionality of the observation space can make disentangling concrete outcomes challenging and can lead to the detection of large numbers of spurious correlations if care isn't taken.  To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a new procedure that extracts a representation from the input data using a foundation model, applies a sparse autoencoder to separate out atomic outcomes.  However, these dimensions may still be strongly entangled.  The authors account for this with an algorithm they propose, NES, that recursively identifies and removes outcomes from the SAE representation, resulting in a set of possible outcomes that can be interpreted by an analyst.  The authors explain how this procedure can be implemented and how it avoids issues around multiple hypothesis testing, and evaluate its performance with semi-synthetic and empirical datasets.

### Strengths
Overall, I think the this is a great paper.  The problem definition, though hard to understand initially, is novel and compelling.  The authors make a solid case about the value of empirical exploratory causal inference, and their approach seems well-reasoned.  Apart from the issue of the problem statement needing more upfront description/examples, the rest of the paper is well-presented, and the writing is clear and easy to follow.  For an approach to solving a problem that hasn't been studied much before, I think the authors did a good job at still doing a reasonable evaluation.  I also appreciate the authors' scientific rigor with respect to the dangers of multiple hypothesis testing and the need for a human analyst.

### Weaknesses
While I generally think the central idea of this paper is strong, the presentation is the weakest part.  The problem definition the authors are working with (RCTs without a directly measured, or even defined, outcome) is interesting but very uncommon in the literature, and the authors' description of it in the paper is insufficient.  The setting seems to be the same as that used in Cadei et al. 2024 and 2025, and it was only through reading the examples in those papers that I was able to really understand the problem domain.

The first part that this lack of sufficient explanation hit for me was at the top of page 2, where the authors state that "Clearly, [understanding the spread of disease from fine-grained social interactions] can be dramatically accelerated with computer vision, using the predictions of a model as input for causal inference pipelines (Cadei et al, 2025)."  Without following the reference, this is the first time "computer vision" or images are brought up, so the "clearly" definitely doesn't work for the reader here.  Similarly, the following sentence about deciding what to annotate is equally unclear when the authors haven't yet given us the framing of the problem as one where outcomes must be inferred from pixels in images.  The authors then, in line 64, mention that the problem they consider is RCTs where the effect is measured indirectly, possibly through imaging.  However, the concept of an RCT without an explicitly measured outcome is counterintuitive in most domains.  When we eventually get details about the ant grooming example, it makes sense and is a compelling problem definition, but until then, the problem statement remains incredibly murky.

My recommendation would be to put the ant grooming example in the introduction.  Even with the brief discussion of the ant grooming problem in this paper (first around like 146, and then again in the experiment section), the details are very light, and it wasn't until I read the first two sections of Cadei et al. 2024 that that data set (and thus your problem definition ) really became clear to me.  I think the main piece that was missing from this paper is why outcomes wouldn't be directly observable in an RCT.  Giving a concrete example and explaining that an outcome could be, for example, a specific type of ant grooming behavior (which can only be inferred by an expert watching the frames of a video) would make the paper much easier to follow.  And then you can easily explain that, while in some cases experts may have specific behavior they're expecting to change upon treatment, this may cause them to miss other interesting behaviors that are also inferable from the video.  Through the rest of the paper, there are other parts that seem like they would benefit from example, so having a running example set up early on would help a lot. (e.g., on page 3, when discussing Figure 2 center and right)

The experiments are interesting and well-done.  However, I wish the authors had actually described what the "palette background" effect was in the ISTAnt experiment.  Even just putting it in the appendix would help.  As-is, needing to go to another paper to even understand the empirical evaluation isn't ideal.  I'm not really even sure what the description on line 430 means ("top right black color mark in the top left position in the first 4 batches of videos") - in the bottom row of Figure 5, I do see black marks in the top right of the first two images, but I'm not sure what "the top left position" means there.

I guess this doesn't really diminish the contribution, but it's very odd to have what looks like an algorithm name in the title of your paper (SAEnce) but then not actually have that be the algorithm name (NES).  From Figure 1, I assumed that NES was just part of an overall procedure called SAEnce, but then you never actually use the term SAEnce outside the title.

While not rampant, there are some grammatical issues that could be cleaned up.  These didn't affect my score, but just for your information, here are some that I noted early on:
- line 43: "or more in general" -> "or more **generally**"
- line 46: "modern science started embracing the creation of atlases" -> "modern science **has started embracing the creation of atlases**
- line 48: "(Weinstein et al., 2013), imaging of cells ..." -> "(Weinstein et al., 2013), **and** imaging of cells ..."
- line 72: "One effect after the other" doesn't fit at the end of that sentence.  You at least need a comma before it (and really, I think it would sound better with a verb, but I'm not quite sure what would fit best - maybe "**, extracting** one effect after the other"?)
- line 127: I think "i.e., T has no causes" should be in parentheses

### Questions
On line 143, what does it mean to "assume T is not directly visible in X".  For example, thinking of the ant grooming example where the treatment is some substance that the ants were given, does this just mean that none of the substance is directly seen in any of the pixels of the images?  If so, how does this map to a "double-blind randomized trial"? (if T not being directly visible in X just means something like not seeing the substance pixels in the image, that doesn't seem to relate to whether or not the ants taking the substance knew that they took it or not)

When discussing Figure 2 (center) in the middle of page 3, this seems to be strongly related to work by Cadei et al., 2024 and 2025.  However, in that 2024 paper, there's a similar, but different, causal structure (Figure 1 in that paper) that seems to describe the same problem where we only observe a high-dimensional observation view of the outcome of interest.  Rather than X being caused by W and Y (as in Figure 2 (center)), they have X being caused by T and W and then causing Y.  Can you explain the reason for this difference, despite the problem settings, at least superficially, seeming very similar?

On line 158, when talking about Figure 2 (right), you state that you have T being independent of W given Y.  However, that doesn't appear to be true in Figure 2 (right) - it looks like conditioning on Y, which is a collider between T and W, would induce dependence.

I feel like I'm missing something about the title.  I get that your approach uses SAEs, and it looks like some sort of play on "seance", but "SAEnce" doesn't appear to be the name of your algorithm (which is NES), and you never refer to the term "SAEnce" in the paper.

### Summary
The paper proposes an exploratory causal inference pipeline for RCTs with unstructured/high-dimensional outcomes. The main contribution is Neural Effect Search and its application on real experimental ecology trial.

### Strengths
The paper is very well-written with clear problem framing and clear methodology paired with real-world case study. It is a promising work for exploratory science workflows.

### Weaknesses
Relation to variable selection. Since NES aims to identify which SAE codes carry treatment effects, could you compare it against classical variable-selection baselines for effect modifiers? E.g., Lasso with group/hierarchical penalties, knockoffs or stability selection for support recovery. Such comparison may clarify what NES adds beyond standard selection.

### Questions
**Q: Computing** v_k **when** Y **is unobserved.**

In eq.4 you define the “neuron effect” vector for factor Y_k as $v_k := \mu(Y_k{=}1)-\mu(Y_k{=}0)$, which you later use for NES. However, in your main RCT setting the semantic factors Y=(Y_1,\dots,Y_r) are not observed. Could you clarify how v_k is computed in practice?

### Summary
The paper aims to discover treatment effects on targets that are unknown. As opposed to prediction-powered causal inference, in which the goal is to perform experiments to study hypotheses on known targets, the paper focuses on exploratory causal inference, where the targets are discovered from data, and causal effects are interpreted afterwards. The proposed approach first obtains representations of measurements through a pretrained foundation model and then reparameterizes them using a sparse autoencoder. Results are provided that state that the resulting variables are entangled, and they are processed through a procedure called Neural Effect Search to produce a set of disentangled variables.

### Strengths
1. A method of performing experimental studies that is not inherently biased by a predetermined hypothesis can be quite useful. The idea of learning targets instead of having a preestablished one is a novel concept.

2. Experiments provide some interesting insight into the consequences of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
3. The problem does not seem very well-defined from the perspective of variable definitions. Notably, it is unclear what makes something an outcome (part of $Y$) or a measurement (part of $X$). Especially if in this problem setting, $Y$ is constructed by processing $X$ deterministically, statistical independence tests (e.g., to check if $T \perp X \mid Y$) are potentially invalid due to lack of positivity.

4. Guarantees of the proposed approach are mostly leveraging mutual information between variables, but mutual information may not capture causal nuances between variables.

5. The paper could be improved in clarity. Notably, it might help to include a figure of the whole pipeline or perhaps an example.

### Questions
6. Is the proposed method restricted to experimental settings in which $T$ is being intervened? Or could it also be applicable in general cases in observational studies such as where $T$ is interpreted as an instrumental variable?

7. Why is it necessary to remap $X$ to a representation from the foundation model?

8. What makes the idea of learning the outcomes different from papers that study causal disentangled representation learning? Is it the idea that outcomes are different from other variables? Why so?
