## Abstract
Peptides, short chains of amino acids capable of high-specificity protein binding, represent a powerful class of therapeutics. While deep generative models have shown promise for peptide design, existing approaches are often structure-centric and therefore generate sequences and structures in a decoupled manner, failing to ensure that designs are simultaneously physically stable, evolutionarily plausible, and internally coherent. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \textbf{PepTri}, a novel diffusion framework that addresses this by jointly generating peptide sequences and 3D structures within a unified, SE(3)-equivariant latent space. Our proposed model integrates three complementary guidance signals during the generative process: (i) physics-informed guidance via differentiable molecular mechanics to ensure structural stability and realism; (ii) evolutionary guidance to bias sequences toward conserved, functional motifs; and (iii) mutual information guidance to explicitly maximize sequence-structure coherence. This tri-guided approach ensures the generative process is steered by biophysical laws, biological priors, and information-theoretic alignment in tandem. Extensive evaluations on challenging peptide-protein design benchmarks, cross-domain (PepBench, LNR) and in-domain (PepBDB), demonstrate that PepTri substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in binding affinity, structural accuracy, and design diversity. Our results establish that integrating these complementary signals directly into the denoising process is crucial for generating viable, high-quality peptide medicines.

### Summary
This paper introduces PepTri, a novel diffusion-based framework for joint sequence-structure peptide design. The core innovation is the integration of three complementary guidance signals during the latent diffusion process: (1) physics-informed guidance via differentiable molecular mechanics (OpenMM/Amber14) to ensure structural stability; (2) evolutionary guidance using BLOSUM-inspired embeddings and co-evolution attention to bias sequences toward biologically plausible motifs; and (3) mutual information (MI) guidance to explicitly maximize sequence-structure coherence. The model operates in a compact, SE(3)-equivariant latent space, enabling efficient and geometrically consistent generation. Extensive evaluations on cross-domain (PepBench→LNR) and in-domain (PepBDB) benchmarks demonstrate that PepTri achieves state-of-the-art performance in binding affinity, structural accuracy, and design diversity, outperforming strong baselines like PepGLAD, PepFlow, and UniMoMo.

### Strengths
Originality: The tri-guidance mechanism represents a novel and creative integration of physical, evolutionary, and information-theoretic principles within a unified diffusion framework.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Extensive benchmarking across multiple datasets (PepBench, LNR, PepBDB) using established metrics (DockQ, ΔG, Contact_F1, GDT_TS) demonstrates clear superiority over strong baselines.

Significant Contribution: Addresses a critical gap in peptide design by ensuring simultaneous physical stability, evolutionary plausibility, and sequence-structure coherence, with clear implications for therapeutic development.

### Weaknesses
Unclear Implementation Details: The technical details supporting a full understanding of this paper are not enough in the main text. Key components like the SE(3)-GNN architecture and all-atom representation are mentioned but not properly described in the main text, with no citations to established architectures. Also, how bond energies are calculated when 2D molecular topology changes during generation, and the relationship between composite energy and OpenMM force field appears redundant without justification. The evolutionary guidance components lack details on training data sources, stability definitions for mutated peptides, and the distinction between co-evolution MHA and standard MHA.

Evaluation Gaps: Despite physics guidance aiming to improve structural validity, no direct evaluation of bond lengths, angles, or clashes is provided to validate these specific improvements. The sequence-structure consistency results show worse performance compared to baselines, which cannot support that the mutual information guidance explicitly maximizes sequence-structure coherence

Suboptimal Organization: Critical ablation studies are relegated to the appendix rather than being in the main text, where they would better support the claims.

### Questions
1. SE(3)-GNN Architecture: Is the SE(3)-equivariant GNN a novel architecture or an adaptation of existing work? Please provide citations and architectural details in the main text.

2. Physics Guidance Mechanics: How are bond lengths and angles enforced during generation when the peptide sequence (and thus 2D topology) is evolving?

3. Energy Function Redundancy: Why are both a composite energy function and OpenMM force field used? What does each contribute that the other doesn't? They looks very similar to me.

4. Evolutionary Training Details: What data is used to train the evolutionary fitness scorer? How is "stability" defined for mutated peptides? How is the conservation predictor trained?

5. Co-evolution MHA: How does the co-evolution multi-head attention differ from standard MHA? What specific evolutionary signals does it capture?

6. Evaluation Metrics: Why are direct structural validity metrics (bond lengths, angles, clashes) not reported?

7. Ablation Study Placement: Why are the critical ablation studies only in the appendix rather than the main text?

### Summary
This paper proposed PepTri, a latent diffusion model for peptide sequence-structure codesign. This model has two decoupled autoencoders, one for sequence and one for structure. Physical guidence based on OpenMM force field is used to constrain structure sampling by backpropagating the energy to the latent space through 3D coordinates. BLOSUM-like constraints are applied to sequence sampling as the evolutionary constraint. Since the model has two autoencoders, a mutual information regularization is added to align sequence and structure representations. The model shows good performance on benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The structural and evolutionary guidances are well-motivated. Since the size of peptide training set is small, it's important to use physical and evolutionary knowledge to constrain the sampling. In addition, previous works applied constraints directly in 3D space, whereas this work formulated a latent space guidance, which is novel.
- The model is evaluated across diverse datasets on metrics such as binding score and demonstrates performance gains consistently.
- Ablation study supports justified the three main components of this model.

### Weaknesses
- The main novelty of this work is more in putting the components together rather than core algorithm contribution. Specifically, both physical and structural constraints have been explored in previous diffusion models for proteins/peptides.
- Evaluation metrics are outdated. Only Rosetta scores are computed which is however noisy and sensitive to minor perturbation. A more reliable evaluation method that has  been used more recently is using AlphaFold to predict the complex structure and compare the RMSD between generation and AlphaFold prediction.

### Questions
- Why did the authors use two separate auto-encoders for sequences and structures instead of a unified auto-encoder? What is the reason for not using a unified auto-encoder?
- What data are the global fitness predictor trained on? How did the author define "global fitness"?

### Summary
This paper proposes PepTri, a latent diffusion framework based on a VAE backbone for peptide generation guided by multiple co-design-related priors. Specifically, the model introduces three types of guidance, including physics, evolutionary, and mutual-information-based guidance, to improve sample validity and diversity. Experimental results on peptide datasets demonstrate promising performance, suggesting that the model can generate structures with better physical plausibility compared to prior works.

### Strengths
1. This paper focuses on an important problem, namely the integration of multiple guidance or prior knowledge into a latent diffusion framework, which is essential for improving controllability and enhancing domain-specific generation quality.
2. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves reasonable improvements in generation quality over baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The overall method remains somewhat vague. Beyond the VAE backbone, the backbone model design of the latent diffusion model is not sufficiently described. Besides, Section 3.2 suffers from inconsistent notation, where the superscript $t$ for time is retained in Section 3.2.1 but omitted in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. It is unclear which loss terms are time-dependent.
2. The ablation study is insufficient. The paper considers three types of guidance, and the current ablation only evaluates the overall contribution of each type. However, each guidance term itself contains multiple components, and the paper does not analyze how the weights among these internal components are balanced or influence performance.
3. The motivation is not clearly discussed. The introduction, methodology section, and the main figure (Figure 1) do not clearly explain why choose these three specific types of guidance. The rationale behind this combination should be better justified.

### Questions
1. The term $L_{phys}$ is used both as a training objective and as a guidance signal at inference time. Why is only this loss term used in both phases? How about the other loss terms?

2. How strong is the reconstruction capability of the VAE itself? Does it constrain the generation quality?

3. Generally, why are the loss terms in Section 3.2 incorporated into the latent diffusion training rather than during the VAE training phase? What is the design motivation for this choice?

### Summary
The paper introduces PepTri, a framework for peptide co-design that can generate both the sequence and the full-atom 3D structure at the same time. It works in an SE(3)-equivariant latent space and adds three kinds of guidance during the denoising process. The first is physics-based, using differentiable terms like bond lengths, angles, clashes, and van der Waals forces to keep the structure realistic. The second is evolutionary, adding BLOSUM-style priors and co-variation patterns to make the sequences biologically reasonable. The third is mutual-information guidance, which helps align the sequence and structure representations using a MINE-style objective. On peptide–protein benchmarks such as PepBench, LNR, and PepBDB, PepTri achieves state-of-the-art performance. The ablation studies show that each type of guidance clearly helps, for example increasing the success rate (Delta G < 0) to 0.583 and improving stability scores. Overall, the paper focuses on combining physical, evolutionary, and statistical signals directly in the denoising process rather than adding them after generation.

### Strengths
The paper presents a fresh and well-motivated idea by combining three kinds of guidance to jointly control both the structure and sequence during diffusion. This tri-guidance setup goes beyond traditional structure-focused pipelines and post-generation checks, offering a more integrated way to ensure the generated peptides are physically and biologically consistent. The use of mutual information to explicitly link sequence and structure is conceptually clear and feels natural for this type of task. Overall, the framework is well designed: it uses an SE(3)-equivariant encoder–decoder with latent diffusion, and the guidance is smoothly applied at every denoising step. The experiments are thorough, with detailed ablations showing how each component contributes to improvements across metrics like Delta G, DockQ, and Contact-F1. The paper is also clearly written, with figures that make the flow of the three guidance types easy to understand. Results on benchmarks such as PepBench, LNR, and PepBDB show consistent and meaningful gains—for example, the success rate with Delta G < 0 rises from about 0.37–0.55 in simpler versions to 0.58 in the full model—demonstrating strong potential for real-world peptide design where both physical realism and biological relevance matter.

### Weaknesses
Physics term scope and calibration:
The paper combines bond, angle, clash, and van der Waals terms into a differentiable physical energy on the peptide side, but it’s not clear how receptor interactions are handled during guidance. The figure suggests the guidance might only cover intra-peptide terms. This could mean the model under-penalizes interface clashes when sampling. It would help to show how sensitive the method is to receptor proximity and whether adding receptor-aware terms changes the results.

MI estimator stability:
MINE-based objectives can be unstable and depend a lot on the critic’s capacity. The paper doesn’t explain how the MI head is regularized or early-stopped, and it doesn’t mention any failure cases like MI collapse. It would be useful to include some diagnostics—like critic loss curves or MI estimates over training—and maybe test an alternative objective such as InfoNCE to check stability.

Generalization claims:
The paper claims the method generalizes across datasets like PepBench and LNR, but it doesn’t really test out-of-distribution cases such as unseen folds, receptors with low homology, or longer peptides. A breakdown by interface size or flexibility would make the generalization story more convincing.

### Questions
Receptor awareness in physics guidance:
 In Fig. 1 you mention that the guidance is intra-peptide. Do you also include receptor–peptide vdW or clash terms during sampling? If not, could you try adding an interface-aware term, even a simple one, and see if DockQ or Contact-F1 improve without reducing diversity?


Ablation on evolutionary priors:
 Besides the BLOSUM-like embedding, how would performance change if you added conservation information from MSA or PLM-based scores? A small controlled comparison could help show where the improvements are actually coming from.


OOD stress tests:
 Could you include some harder out-of-distribution cases, like longer peptides, flexible or induced-fit receptors, and low-homology targets? Showing success rates by interface size or flexibility would make the generalization results more convincing.


Energy function design:
 How is the energy function defined, and why was it designed that way? Could leaving out other physical terms (like electrostatics or solvation) be affecting the final performance?
