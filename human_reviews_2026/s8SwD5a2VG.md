## Abstract
Electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level temporal resolution but suffers from poor spatial precision, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers fine-grained spatial detail at the expense of cost and latency. Leveraging their complementarity, an emerging direction is to synthesize fMRI from EEG, enriching EEG with spatial information while retaining its efficiency. However, existing EEG to fMRI generation methods often lack designs to preserve information completeness and neglect neurophysiological priors, leading to reconstructions that may appear plausible but fail to ensure neuroscientific validity. We introduce NeuroCycle, a cyclic EEG–fMRI generation framework that enforces information completeness and neuroscientific plausibility. It incorporates two neurophysiological priors: (i) a Cross-Modal ROI-wise Structural Module that aligns fMRI embeddings with EEG-derived correlation patterns to preserve regional organization, and (ii) an R2E Physiological Connectivity Guidance Module that supervises covariance matrices via Riemannian-to-Euclidean mapping to maintain functional connectivity. The bidirectional cycle (EEG$\rightarrow$fMRI$\rightarrow$EEG) further enforces information completeness and cross-modal alignment, ensuring that synthesized fMRI retains key neural information. Experiments on NODDI and Oddball datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, producing sharper voxel-wise fMRI with richer neural information, preserved connectivity, and stronger cross-modal alignment.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach to neural transcoding from the EEG to the fMRI modality. Among all, the authors propose a ROI approach which is unique to this particular task, as well as the clever idea of implementing an EEG to fMRI to again EEG cycle to improve the stability of the generated data.

### Strengths
- the paper presents a different take on this task wrt the current SotA, by proposing to align both EEG and fMRI features to physical positions in the head.

- performances are SotA, as per Tab. 1.

- qualitative results are also provided in Fig. 4, directly compared with another method in literature.

### Weaknesses
- the flow of the approach is not entirely clear. Sec. 3.2, particularly, seems unnecessarily complicated with inline formulas. It distracts the reader from following the flow of the approach.

- generated images, as per Fig. 4, looks very similar to NT-ViT for me. Just like NT-ViT, they fail to capture the correct shape of the brain and more complex inner structures, especially visible to me on the Sagittal view of the first example of the NODDI dataset.

- the cross-validation scheme used for the experiments is not specified. For instance, NT-ViT oes both kfold and LOSO cross-validations. to compare apple to apples, it is necessary to use the same protocol, and this is a very major issue (!!!).

- ablation study in Tab. 2 is partial. First, it is not compared to a baseline (no cycle, no R2E-PCG, no CM-RS), making it impossible to assess the relevance of each module. Second, combinations are not tried (like no cycle but both modules, or cycle and just CM-RS).

- in Fig. 5, the reconstructed EEG Mel-spectrogram, which would have been very informative, is not shown.

- in Tab. 1, the second-best results are not highlighted (like for example underlining it).

- there are no references or links to anonymized code in the main manuscript (!!!).

Now, as sidenotes:

- citation at L052 might be wrong as E2fGAN has not been proposed in Calhas' paper.

- on L165, the reviewer believes that "incorporate" is not the right word, because "spectral information" are already present in the signals. Maybe the authors meant something like "extract"?

- typo on L199: "...regions, We apply a..."

### Questions
- What naturally comes after the weaknesses discussion is that it would be good to know the validation scheme used during the experiments.

But, anyway, the reviewer believes both k-fold and LOSO results should have been presented by the authors.

- What are the practical differences, minutes and details produced by data generated with NeuroCycle wrt NT-ViT? It is hard to tell from Fig. 4 alone, and its caption is not informative enough for the reviewer to guess.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method (NeuroCycle) to generate fMRI data from EEG recordings. The main contribution of the paper over the previous methods is to try and enforce neurophysiological constraints on the generated fMRI data. The authors claim to achieve this by adding two modules on top of VAE-style EEG/fMRI encoder/decoder modules (the two resulting representations are themselves also connected through a bidirectional cross-"flow" matching module). The first one (named cross-modal ROI-wise structural module) is meant to preserve the functional connectivity observed in the GT-EEG data in the learned fMRI embeddings (which are used to reconstruct EEG data in the next step). The idea being that ROIs that have stronger functional connections should have embeddings that map closer to each other in the embedding space. The second module (named R2E Physiological connectivity guidance module) uses the GT-EEG covariance connectivity and attempts to make sure that it is similar to the reconstructed EEG covariance connectivity with distance calculated using log-euclidean distance. The method is "cyclical" in the sense that the GT-EEG data is used to generate fMRI data, the encoded embeddings from this fMRI data in turn reconstruct EEG data with neurophysiological constraints enforced through the above mentioned modules.

### Strengths
The paper tackles an important problem in neuroscience i.e. the feasibility of obtaining fMRI data vs the relative ease with which EEG data can be obtained. It is a significant problem as it's nearly impossible to obtain fMRI data for research purposes in developing countries (in some countries there is a single site available for the whole country). If high-quality neurophysiologically relevant fMRI data can be generated from EEG, that can be impactful.

The overall idea is strong. Without constraints it is indeed likely that fMRI data generated from EEG would look visually plausible but may not make neuroscientific sense. 

The paper is also generally well-written and laid out and is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- My first concern about the method is the number of hyperparameters involved. There are 6 hyperparameters that would need to be tuned just in the loss function. Not to mention the architecture and training parameters involved in the training and the temperature parameter. 
- The experiments section is light on details - it's not immediately clear how the data was divided into train/val/test (if at all). There's also no mention of how and what values of hyperparameters were chosen. Also, what does generalization look like? Does the model generalize only within datasets? Does it generalize outside datasets? Can I train on oddball and test on NODDI? Other way round? Or do I have to retrain on a portion of my EEG dataset everytime? which would reduce the applicability of the method.
- It's also unclear why the cross-modal "flow matching" module is called as such. As far as I can tell there's no flow-matching happening. The only thing that is happening is that the MSE between the EEG and fMRI embeddings is being minimized in cross-spaces. I don't think that constitutes flow matching, you'd need some notion of velocity of these embeddings for that to be happening here, which could be there if there was a notion of time in these embeddings. Which, as far as I can tell, isn't there.
- Also, please put citations in parenthesis at end of sentences, will improve readability a lot.

### Questions
- I'm curious to know what happens to time? is it just averaged out at the very beginning (line 208)? so the generated fMRI images are just mean images?
- Figure 4, while yes, the proposed method does generate sharper images, I'm not convinced by those particular images that the generated fMRI data is similar to the GT. Especially so in the case of Oddball. It might be worth including fMRI expert evaluations on random subsets to ensure the useful aspects of the data are actually being generated.
- Figure 5, I wonder what these would look like if you take the generated fMRI data from competitor methods and generate EEG data from those on a trained model from your method.

### Summary
This paper proposes NeuroCycle, a cyclic EEG–fMRI generation framework that integrates neurophysiological priors to ensure information completeness and biological plausibility. Unlike previous unidirectional EEG to fMRI models, NeuroCycle employs a bidirectional cycle (EEG to fMRI to EEG) enforced through flow matching. Two key modules, i.e., (1) the Cross-Modal ROI-wise Structural Module and (2) the R2E Physiological Connectivity Guidance Module, inject physiological constraints into the model, preserving functional connectivity and ROI-level structure.

### Strengths
I find this paper technically novel and conceptually interesting. The bidirectional generation between EEG and fMRI addresses an important and challenging problem in multimodal neuroimaging. Unlike traditional unidirectional approaches, this work introduces a cyclic generation framework and effectively incorporates spatial priors to guide the learning of fMRI representations. The experimental validation is thorough, and the reported improvements over existing baselines are consistent and significant.

### Weaknesses
Currently, the paper uses regional information of EEG to guide the fMRI learning. May be one can also consider using BOLD delay characteristics to guide the learning of fMRI. Besides, since the training involves reconstructing EEG from fMRI, what is the computational complexity compared to unidirectional generation?

### Questions
1. Could the framework be extended to MEG or intracranial EEG, which have higher spatial precision?

2. Is the learned fMRI representation temporally aligned with the BOLD delay characteristics?

3. What is the difference between the proposed method and cycleGAN, and what is the advantage of the proposed approach in the considered scenario?

### Summary
This paper presents NeuroCycle, a physiologically constrained cyclic framework for generating fMRI volumes from EEG signals. The model introduces two key modules: the Cross-Modal ROI-wise Structural Module and the R2E Physiological Connectivity Guidance Module, to preserve brain regional organization and functional connectivity in EEG. A bidirectional EEG-fMRI flow matching cycle enforces information completeness and cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the NODDI and Oddball datasets show improved voxel-level spatial reconstruction quality and better preservation of  EEG neural information.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-organized, easy to follow, and well-motivated; the figures are pretty.
2. The framework design, particularly the bidirectional mapping between EEG and fMRI and constraints on the EEG connectivity patterns, reflects thoughtful consideration of cross-modal consistency and physiological plausibility.
3. The model achieved the best performance compared with other baselines in reconstructing the spatial structure of fMRI.

### Weaknesses
**Major issues**
1. **This paper suffers from a fundamental issue: the model’s generalizability to new subjects or datasets appears questionable, which would substantially constrain its potential for real-world applications**: 
    - The fMRI data used in the paper seem to lack standard preprocessing steps such as skull stripping and spatial normalization (e.g., to MNI space), which would make the learned mapping highly subject-specific. Without signal-level regularization or spatial alignment, the model is likely to reconstruct averaged brain structures or anatomically inconsistent brain volumes for unseen subjects (Since every individual’s brain anatomy is unique, it would be impossible for a model trained on unregistered brains to accurately reconstruct a new subject’s brain structure), resulting in unrealistic ROI-level signals after parcellation. Consequently, when voxel-wise volumes are parcellated into ROI-level time series, the resulting signals may no longer reflect physiologically meaningful BOLD fluctuations, as the defined ROIs might not correspond to their true anatomical locations. This can lead to (1) distorted functional connectivity estimation and (2) reduced reliability in downstream analyses.
    - In short, without appropriate preprocessing and careful consideration of fMRI-specific characteristics, the model risks generating anatomically plausible but functionally meaningless fMRI volumes, thereby undermining both the biological validity and generalizability of its results. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that paired EEG–fMRI datasets are typically small and scarce, making the model prone to overfitting and less capable of reconstructing realistic brain structures and shapes or neural activity patterns for unseen subjects (and there would also would be potential domain shifts across different demographics or MRI scanners/sites), raising concerns about the physiological validity of the approach. 

2. The paper evaluates the generated fMRI only in terms of spatial reconstruction quality, without further analyses such as temporal reconstruction assessment, which is crucial for validating the reliability of fMRI signals used in functional connectivity estimation or ROI time-series extraction. Also, the capability of the reconstructed fMRI volumes to support higher-level tasks, such as behavioral decoding, cognitive task analysis, or other downstream applications, remains unknown, making it difficult to demonstrate the practical utility of the generated fMRI signals.

3. Unless I missed it, the paper does not clearly specify the training and test set details, making the data usage somewhat non-transparent. Since the authors mention that their preprocessing follows Lanzino et al., it would be important to clarify whether the same data-splitting strategy was adopted. In Lanzino et al., both fixed-split and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation were performed - which of these approaches (or any other) was used in this work?

4. It is interesting to observe that during training, the model appears capable of preserving realistic EEG characteristics, such as spectral component distributions and EEG connectivity patterns. However, since the main objective of the paper is to reconstruct fMRI signals, there are no experiments or results demonstrating that the reconstructed fMRI preserves its own physiological priors or can accurately reproduce the corresponding fMRI connectivity matrix (so the last sentence in the abstract is a bit overstated).


**Minor issues**
1. The paper does not include ablation studies on key loss components (e.g., the alignment loss)
2. Standard deviations are not reported.
3. In the Dataset section, the paper states that the Oddball EEG dataset contains 43 channels, and the experimental setup section mentions 34 channels.

### Questions
1. In Figure 5(b), why are only channels 3 and 7 shown? What do these channel indices correspond to in terms of channel names (like Fz, F1…), and how does the model perform on average across all channels?

2. What does the x-axis in Figure 5(c) represent? Does it correspond to the temporal variation of the band-filtered topology maps?
Which dataset does Figure 5 correspond to? i.e., Is subject 46 from the NODDI dataset or the Oddball dataset?

3. It is not entirely clear how the 4D fMRI volumes are projected into ROI-level representations in the F→E branch. Is this accomplished through anatomical parcellation based on registered structural scans + encoder, or directly via a learnable projection module within the network to project it to the ROI embedding space?
    - If the former is the case, it contradicts the claimed applicability to scenarios where no MRI scan is available (e.g., when using EEG alone), since anatomical parcellation would be infeasible.
    - Conversely, if the projection is learnable and produces ROI-level embeddings, it remains unclear how realistic ROI time series can be recovered from these embeddings or from the generated fMRI volumes. Given that fMRI data are considerably blurrier than T1-weighted anatomical scans, reliable ROI parcellation from such synthetic volumes would be highly challenging, as mentioned above.
