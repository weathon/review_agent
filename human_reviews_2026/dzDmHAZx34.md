# Rectified Flows for Fast Multiscale Fluid Flow Modeling

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 4, 2, 8

## Abstract
The statistical modeling of fluid flows is very challenging due to their multiscale dynamics and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. While recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We introduce a rectified-flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity. In addition, we develop a curvature-aware integration scheme that monitors local path straightness and adaptively regularizes the velocity and step size, improving stability and accuracy at essentially no training cost. Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.

### Summary
The paper proposed a rectified flow-based algorithm to model fluid flows in an end-to-end manner. Given a complex PDE, initial conditions and corresponding numerical solutions at a target time are used as training data pairs. Similar to rectified flow, the authors developed a conditional velocity matching scheme in training, where the initial values are considered as conditions. At inference stage, a curvature-aware velocity is integrated to generate target samples. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks in both accuracy and speed.

### Strengths
1. The paper developed a solid method to help investigate statistical properties of fluid flow using generative models. The proposed rectified flow model bypasses the complicated PDE dynamics and learns the transition directly given the initial state. 
2. To resolve issues in integration, the velocity field is regularized according to the curvature. Error analysis suggests that the method is theoretically sound.
3. The authors carried out experimental studies in various 2D scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. Both accuracy and speed outperforms the state-of-the-art.
4. The paper is well-organized and easy to read, with a detailed appendix explaining the network architecture, experiment setup and results.

### Weaknesses
1. It seems that the paper is an extension of [1], where the major difference is to substitute a conditional diffusion backbone by rectified flow. Improvement is limited from a modeling point of view. It can also be expected that rectified flow has a faster inference speed than diffusion model. Drawbacks of rectified flow compared to diffusion models, i.e. potential lack of diversity, are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

2. The proposed method is shown to be effective only for a fixed time lag. Yet in many cases, solutions of different time lags are expected to be computed auto-regressively. The paper does not consider such cases.

### Questions
1. For the curvature-aware velocity, it seems that hyper-parameters are used for regularization. Is it possible to carry out a sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters?

2. As is mentioned above, no PDE solutions are computed an auto-regressive manner. Is it possible to carry out an experiment in the All2All regime to study the generation accuracy auto-regressively, meaning first generate \hat{u}_{t_1}, then use it to generate \hat{u}_{t_2} and compare \hat{u}_{t_2} with the ground truth?

### Summary
This paper proposes RecFlow, a rectified flow framework for modeling multiscale fluid flows via deterministic ODE trajectories instead of stochastic diffusion. The method achieves diffusion-level fidelity with only 8–10 steps by learning a straightening velocity field and introducing a curvature-aware integration scheme for stable sampling.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses the challenge of reducing the computational cost of diffusion-based PDE surrogates for multiscale fluid flows.
- The proposed curvature-aware integration is simple, well-motivated, and empirically shown to improve stability and efficiency.
- Experiments on multiple 2D benchmarks are thorough, showing up to 22$\times$ faster inference with comparable or better accuracy than diffusion models.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty is limited. RecFlow largely mirrors the conditional diffusion framework, e.g., GenCFD, and mainly replaces the stochastic SDE with a deterministic ODE rectified flow formulation.
- The paper does not provide a clear computational trade-off analysis between ODE solver cost, step size, and network evaluation time, which is crucial for assessing real efficiency.
- The loss formulation is conceptually inconsistent with the trajectory construction. The model predicts the displacement $u_{tgt} - u_{src}$ even though the interpolant $x_\tau = \tau u_{tgt} + \sigma(1-\tau)\xi$ lies between noise and $u_{tgt}$, not between $u_{src}$ and $u_{tgt}$. It remains unclear what the network truly learns, a conditional physical displacement or a denoising vector field, and how this aligns with inference, which also starts from noise.  
- The conditioning variable $\Phi(\Delta t)$ appears in Algorithm 1 but disappears in the main formulation of $v_\theta(u_\tau, u_i, \tau)$ in the text.

### Summary
The paper applies the transport learning method of Rectified Flows to the task of statistical modeling for fluid flows that potentially exhibit complex multiscale dynamics and high sensitivity to initial conditions. This "straighter" transport path, resulting from rectified flow objective, allows for faster sampling by solving a deterministic ODE with large steps. The paper introduces a curvature-aware integration scheme that uses an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the velocity field to detect local path curvature and adaptively regularizes the velocity update and the step size to improve stability and accuracy.

### Strengths
- Writing is clear, concise and easy to understand.
- Empirical results on the benchmarks seem to support the advantage of using Rectified Flow based training objective to learn the transport.

### Weaknesses
- Venue: ICLR does not seem to be the right venue for this paper. Rectified Flows and other related transport learning methods (Diffusion, Flow Matching, Stochastic Interpolants etc.) are now considered very well known and established in ML with applications to generative models and density modeling. This paper appears to be a direct application of Rectified Flows for the purpose of learning a transport map for fluids with little technical innovation on the method itself. Perhaps, this application and it’s results would appeal more at a venue oriented towards applied methods for physical systems. This direcltiy mismatch in venue is direct source of the next weakness
- Novelty: The paper is a straightforward application of Rectified Flows in a different domain. Albeit a potentialliy new integration scheme is proposed, it would at best best considered relatively minor contribution (more on this in the next point). Lot’s of the observed properties in this paper, resulting from Rectified Flows, are expected to result from their use, though likely not verified in this domain.
- The integration scheme, could potentially be novel, however it’s empirical evaluation is lacking. Ideally, various integrators would be compared and their computation/accuracy tradeoff would be compared. Note that a lot of work exists in the space of faster sampling from diffusion/transport models, including learning straigher trajectories and deterministic maps(Rectified Flows, DDIM etc.), K-Rectification, Distillation etc to name a few. Further, coupled with the fact that all these transport learning methods are related, in that they learn stochastic/deterministic transport, and mostly differ in their noise schedules and training objective, a different method/noise schedule may be ideal for different applications/problems. 
- Non-uniqueness of Sampling/Integration scheme: In addition, for any of these learned models, a variety of samplers could be constructed (including deterministic/various stochastic c.f. Singh and Fisher, Stochastic Sampling from Deterministic Flow Models) and used interchangeably, though with different properties.

Overall, I don’t think ICLR is the right venue for this paper. It appears to be a applied paper in physics domain of fluid flow modeling. An appropriate venue would be a better judge of the impact of this application of Rectified Flows in that field. From an ML perspective, I don’t see significant novelty. Happy to be convinced otherwise.

The proposed approach employs rectified flows to reduce the number of solver steps by maintaining straight trajectories. Experiments on different datasets showed that the approach is more efficient and has high accuracy.

### Strengths
- Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the framework and visualises the main difference in terms of performance, compared to the FNO.
- The proposed approach is well-written with detailed explanations about the implementation (via Algorithm 1). 
- Experiments showed improvement in the efficiency of the approach compared to the baseline (Table 1 and Figure 2).

### Weaknesses
- Minors: 
	+ The presentation of the paper (sections 1 to 3) can be reorganised, since currently, the approach comes before related works, and contains the research question, which may be placed into the introduction.
	+ At L139: SM 5 might refer to the section 5.
