# Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search for Vehicle Routing Problems

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 6, 4, 2

## Abstract
Recent progress in neural combinatorial optimization has shown promise for vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Iterative improvement frameworks address the limitations of pure construction policies, which often struggle with exploration and large-scale performance, but they remain constrained by solution encodings that ignore the hierarchical structure of routes. We introduce Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search (HADES), a neural improvement method with distance-aware, anisometric positional encodings tailored to routing solutions. HADES incorporates two complementary components: an in-route positional encoding, which captures the circular and non-uniform ordering of nodes within tours, and a cross-route encoding, which represents route membership and structural relations across tours. This hierarchical design provides solution representations better aligned with the anisometric and head-tail connected nature of VRPs, leading to more effective deconstruction. Extensive experiments across multiple VRP variants demonstrate that our model consistently advances the state of the art, with particularly strong gains on large-scale benchmarks. We will make our source code publicly available to foster future research.

### Summary
This paper introduces Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search (HADES), a neural improvement method for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) that addresses the limitation of existing approaches in ignoring route hierarchical structures. HADES integrates two distance-aware, anisometric positional encodings: in-route positional encoding (IPE), which captures the circular and non-uniform order of nodes within a route by leveraging cumulative travel distance, and cross-route positional encoding (CPE), which represents the global spatial relationship of each route relative to the depot and other routes.   
HADES outperforms SOTA traditional OR solvers and neural methods across three VRP variants (CVRP, VRPTW, PCVRP) and multiple instance sizes (500, 1000, 2000), especially showing strong advantages in large-scale benchmarks.  
I think this idea is interesting, novel and worthy of in-depth study, but the experimental setup and results are not very solid, includes the fact that the extent of the performance improvement is not significant, and the generalization ability of the new method when not trained separately on different size VRP problems has not been discussed. This makes the actual effect of this idea questionable.

### Strengths
1. The idea that incorporates in-route positional encoding and cross-route encoding is interesting and novel.
2. Adopts a "deconstruction-reconstruction + ASA" framework combined with winner-takes-all policy-gradient training, balancing exploration and exploitation in optimization to enhance solution quality and stability.
3. Includes comprehensive experiments with diverse baselines, multi-scale test sets, and strict time constraints, ensuring good result credibility, and authors commit to open-sourcing the code to facilitate field research.
4. The hierarchical encoding idea is model-agnostic, applicable to other similary combinatorial optimization problems.
5. Well writing and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
Overall, the experimental setup and results are not very solid, including the fact that the extent of the performance improvement is not significant, and the generalization ability of the new method when not trained separately on different size VRP problems has not been discussed.
1. The comparison in Table 1 is not fair. The method proposed in this paper trains a model for each probem and each probelm size, but the other baseline methods do not do so.
2. For the ablation experiments in Tables 2 and 4, the improvement of the method proposed in this paper is very small. This indicate that the core contribution of the article is limited.

### Questions
I like the idea of this article(incorporates in-route positional encoding and cross-route encoding), but the current experimental results cannot fully demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea. If the author could provide additional explanations regarding the effectiveness of the idea, I would be happy to raise my rating score.
1. Additional experiment: Train a model on VRP problems with all problem sizes, and then compare the results with the baseline algorithms.
2. This article does not provide any information regarding the results of the VRP problem on a smaller scale(e.g. 50/100). So, how effective is it?
3. For cvrp problem, maybe the author could test the dataset from cvrplib.

### Summary
This paper proposes HADES, a neural improvement framework for VRPs. HADES introduces a novel set of hierarchical positional encodings: 1) In-route Positional Encoding (IPE): A distance-aware sinusoidal encoding that captures the non-uniform spacing and circular, head-tail connected topology of nodes within a single route. 2) Cross-route Positional Encoding (CPE): A depot-anchored angular encoding that represents the global spatial relationship of routes relative to each other. These encodings are integrated into an encoder-decoder model that learns a deconstruction policy (i.e., which customers to remove). This policy is then used within an Augmented Simulated Annealing (ASA) search framework to iteratively improve solutions. Extensive experiments on large-scale CVRP, VRPTW, and PCVRP benchmarks show that HADES achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming both strong Operations Research (OR) solvers and neural methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and the motivation is exceptionally clear.

2. The experimental evaluation is convincing. It is benchmarked on three VRP variants (CVRP, VRPTW, PCVRP) with different scales (N=500, 1000, 2000). The comparison includes both SOTA OR solvers and learning-based methods. The authors provide detailed ablation studies, confirming that both the proposed IPE and CPE are necessary for enhanced performance.

3. This work delivers SOTA results on challenging, large-scale benchmarks. The proposed encodings may be "model-agnostic building blocks", which may not be limited to the HADES framework and could be integrated into other NCO architectures (both constructive and improvement-based methods).

### Weaknesses
1. The Cross-route Positional Encoding (CPE) depends on "randomly" selecting a reference route $r^*$ to define the zero-angle. This introduces a source of stochasticity that is not analyzed. 

2. The CPE is "depot-anchored", calculating all route angles relative to the single depot. This is a fine assumption for the problems tackled (CVRP, VRPTW, PCVRP). However, it's unclear how this specific design would generalize to other important VRP variants, such as the Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP). This limitation on the CPE's applicability could be discussed.

### Questions
1. Could the authors clarify the procedure for selecting the "randomly selected reference route" $r^*$? Is this route chosen once per instance and then fixed, or is it re-sampled during the improvement process? Have you conducted any experiments on the sensitivity of HADES to this random choice?

2. As mentioned in the weaknesses, the CPE is depot-anchored. Do the authors have any insights on how this idea of a cross-route angular encoding could be extended to problems without a single, central depot, such as Multi-Depot VRP?

### Summary
This paper introduces HADES (Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search), a neural improvement method for VRPs that incorporates distance-aware, anisometric positional encodings. The method features two complementary components: (1) in-route positional encoding (IPE) that captures circular and non-uniform ordering within tours using cumulative travel distance, and (2) cross-route positional encoding (CPE) that represents route membership via depot-anchored angular encoding. The approach is evaluated on CVRP, VRPTW, and PCVRP, demonstrating improvements over strong baselines.

### Strengths
- The insight that VRP solutions require anisometric (distance-aware) rather than isometric (index-based) positional encodings is compelling. The combination of IPE (within-route) and CPE (across-route) encodings elegantly captures the hierarchical structure of VRP solutions, addressing a genuine gap in how neural methods represent solutions.
- HADES achieves consistent improvements over HGS/PyVRP-HGS baselines (-0.30% to -4.94% gaps) and outperforms the recent NDS method across CVRP, VRPTW, and PCVRP.
- The paper is well-written with effective figures (especially Figure 3 contrasting LLM vs. VRP positional encodings).

### Weaknesses
- On CVRP-500, HADES achieves only -0.30% improvement over HGS, barely better than NDS (-0.20%). While larger instances show stronger gains, the marginal improvement on smaller scales suggests the method's advantage is primarily in scalability rather than fundamental quality.
- Incomplete Analysis of Discovered Heuristics: The paper claims operators are "novel and powerful" but provides no concrete examples. No visualization or interpretation of what the model learns through IPE/CPE. Missing analysis of which types of removals the model prioritizes (e.g., does it preferentially select customers with high cumulative distance? customers at angular boundaries?
- Computational Cost Not Reported: Training cost is not mentioned (2000 epochs × 150K instances × 128 rollouts is substantial). Comparison of training cost vs. performance gain is missing. No discussion of whether the improvements justify the training investment.
- Methodological Concerns: CPE reference route selection: Randomly selecting a reference route r* seems arbitrary. How sensitive is performance to this choice? Would a consistent selection (e.g., leftmost route) be more stable? Head-tail alignment: The circular normalization ˆdi = (di/dL) · 2π ensures IPE(v1) = IPE(vL), but this assumes symmetric distance matrices. For asymmetric problems, this alignment may be misleading. 
- The term "anisometric" is used extensively but never formally defined. A brief definition would help readability.
- Algorithm notation inconsistency: the paper uses both πθ(·|·) and p(·|·) for the policy
- Experimental Design: Why use different numbers of augmentations for different problems (8 for CVRP/VRPTW, 128 for PCVRP)? This inconsistency is not explained. Test set sizes vary (128 for CVRP-500 from Drakulic, 100 for CVRP-1000/2000 from Ye, 250 new for VRPTW/PCVRP). This heterogeneity complicates comparison. No error bars or variance across runs reported.
- NCO-LLM and other LLM-based methods are included but not discussed in detail.
- Generalization Claims: Table 3 tests low-capacity and clustered distributions, but these are relatively mild distribution shifts. More challenging shifts (e.g., extremely heterogeneous demands, mixed urban/rural layouts) would strengthen the generalization story.

### Questions
1. Computational Cost Analysis
What is the total training cost (GPU hours, wall-clock time, dollars) for each problem/size? On CVRP-500, you improve by only 0.10% absolute (36.66 → 36.60) over HGS. Does the performance gain justify the training investment, and at what deployment scale does HADES become cost-effective?

2. IPE Normalization Across Routes
You normalize cumulative distance per route: ˆdi = (di/dL) · 2π. How does this handle tours of vastly different lengths in the same solution (e.g., one route of length 100, another of length 10)? Doesn't the same physical distance map to different IPE values across routes, breaking the "distance-aware" property you emphasize? Have you tried global normalization instead?

3. CPE Reference Route Selection
The reference route r is randomly selected, meaning different random seeds produce different CPE values for the same solution. How does the model handle this non-determinism during training and testing? Have you compared random vs. deterministic selection (e.g., leftmost route)? Additionally, why not use circular mean instead of arithmetic mean for ϕr to avoid wraparound issues (e.g., averaging 10° and 350° gives 180°)?

4. Interpretability and Learned Strategies
Can you provide concrete examples with visualizations showing what removal patterns HADES learns? Does it preferentially remove customers with high cumulative distance, customers at route boundaries, or customers from specific angular sectors? Can you visualize decoder attention weights to show which customers receive high attention? This analysis is crucial for understanding why your method works and building trust for practical deployment.

5. Statistical Rigor
Table 1 reports point estimates with no error bars or variance. Can you provide standard deviations across multiple runs, confidence intervals, and statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-test vs. HGS)? 

6. Ablation to Isolate Contributions
The IPE ablation shows only 0.02% improvement (36.56 → 36.54), while CPE shows 0.04% (36.57 → 36.54). These gains seem marginal. Have you tested an "NDS + IPE/CPE" configuration to isolate whether the improvements come from the encodings vs. other algorithmic choices (winner-takes-all training, architecture, hyperparameters)? Can you attribute the 0.10-0.14% gain over NDS to specific components?

7. Generalization Beyond Training Distribution
You train on N ≤ 400 but test on N = 2000 (5× larger). Why not train on larger instances? Table 3 tests relatively mild distribution shifts (low capacity, clustered layouts). Can you test more challenging shifts like extreme demand heterogeneity (demand ∈ {1, 100}), mixed urban/rural layouts, asymmetric distances, or multi-depot problems? How well do the circular and radial inductive biases hold in these cases?

8. Experimental Design Concerns
Several design choices seem inconsistent or unexplained: (a) Why use 8× augmentations for CVRP/VRPTW but 128× for PCVRP? (b) Your test protocol uses 200 rollouts × 8 augmentations = 1600 evaluations while HGS/SISRs use deterministic search. Is this a fair computational comparison? (d) Why use different test set sizes (128, 100, 250) across benchmarks?

9. Practical Deployment and Future Directions
Can HADES handle real-world constraints like driver breaks, multiple depots, and heterogeneous fleets, or would you need to retrain for each constraint? 

**Minor Corrections**

- Line 229: "ˆdi = di/dL · 2π" should clarify whether this is element-wise
- Figure 4: The illustration could benefit from showing actual angle values

### Summary
This paper proposes Hierarchical Aggregation Deconstruction Search (HADES), a neural improvement framework for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) under the umbrella of Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO). The core motivation is to address the limitation of existing neural improvement methods, which fail to capture the hierarchical structure and anisometric nature of VRP solutions. HADES introduces two complementary positional encodings: (1) In-Route Positional Encoding (IPE), which uses cumulative travel distance to model the circular and non-uniform order of nodes within a route; and (2) Cross-Route Positional Encoding (CPE), which leverages depot-anchored average angles of routes to capture global inter-route structural relations.

### Strengths
1. HADES explicitly targets two under-explored properties of VRP solutions: hierarchical structure and anisometry. This design aligns with the intrinsic geometric characteristics of VRPs.
2. The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple dimensions: (1) three canonical VRP variants to validate generality; (2) large-scale instances to test scalability; (3) both OR solvers and neural methods as baselines to ensure competitiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The core value of IPE and CPE is undermined by their minimal performance contributions. 
2. The authors claim IPE and CPE are “grounded in VRP geometry,” but provide no rigorous theoretical support for key design choices.

### Questions
According to the ablation experiment, IPE and CPE, the core contributions of the paper, do not seem to play a great role. How to view the importance of the method?
