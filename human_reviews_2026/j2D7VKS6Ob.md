## Abstract
Instrumental Variable (IV) regression is an established technique for estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounders. A core IV assumption is that we have access to an external variable---called the instrument---which directly influences the treatment variable. In this work, we consider a more challenging yet realistic setting where the treatment is high-dimensional but admits a latent structure, through which it interacts with the outcome. To overcome this problem, we leverage insights from the Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA), which is a framework that relaxes the independence assumption in Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Specifically, we propose a general contrastive learning framework to recover the latent features up to an affine transformation which may be related to the instrument by a (non-)linear function. We prove that the recovered representation is compatible with standard IV techniques. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using control function and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimators and evaluate the robustness of the learned estimators in distribution shift setting.

### Summary
This paper addresses a significant and realistic extension of the classic IV setting by considering the case where the treatment variable is latent and only observed through a nonlinear, potentially high-dimensional transformation. The authors propose a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages insights from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to recover the latent treatment variable up to an affine transformation. They theoretically prove that the recovered representation maintains compatibility with classical IV estimation techniques.
Comprehensive empirical results evaluates the robustness of the learned estimators under distribution shift conditions—an important practical consideration.

### Strengths
1. A key strength is the creative integration of ideas from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into a contrastive learning framework for causal estimation. This cross-disciplinary approach is innovative and provides a principled way to address the identifiability challenge.

2. The paper provides a crucial theoretical proof that the representation recovered by their method remains compatible with classical IV estimators. 

3. The empirical analysis is robust, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness with multiple classical estimators (Control Function and 2SLS). Importantly, the evaluation includes performance under distribution shifts, which is critical for assessing real-world robustness and is often overlooked.

### Weaknesses
1. The assumptions underlying this model setting appear somewhat restrictive, as they rest on the hypothesis that the observed variable X is solely influenced by the latent treatment. Given that the core assumptions of the instrumental variable approach are already challenging to verify, the justification for introducing additional assumptions concerning X becomes even more tenuous.

2. The logic of the paper is hindered by some typos, compromising the reader's ability to follow its arguments. The details about the typos can be found in questions.

### Questions
1. There are some inconsistent notations in paper writing. For example, in Line 168, the IV is notated as Z. However, the latent treatment is introduced after Line 178. I think in Line 168, it should be X.

2. In Line 176, it says "however, X has to be available at test time." Since the availability of X is a natural requirement of IV regression, I think it does not form as the shortcoming of control function method.

3. In Lemma 4.3, the conclusion may cause some confusion. The function $\hat{f}$ is learned on the representation $\tau(Z)$. What does it imply by combining the ground truth $f_0$ with $\tau(Z)$.

4. The figure of framework is rough and simple. I suggest the authors to refine it and improve the presentation.

### Summary
This paper studies causal effect estimation in scenarios with unobserved confounders where the treatment variable is latent rather than directly observed. Inspired by Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA), the authors propose InfoIV, a general contrastive learning framework designed to recover latent treatment variables for causal effect estimation.

### Strengths
1.The authors consider a more realistic setting where the treatment variable is unobserved, extending the applicability of instrumental variable regression.

2.The paper provides a coherent set of assumptions, definitions, and theoretical proofs to establish the validity of the InfoIV framework.

3.The method is conceptually simple and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1.It would be helpful to include a demonstrative example to illustrate why recovering a latent treatment variable Z is necessary when an observed variable X already exists. This would help clarify the motivation and conceptual necessity of introducing a latent treatment representation.

2.In Equation (6), the authors employ an encoder to recover Z from X. While this is an interesting design, it remains unclear why a contrastive learning paradigm can reliably recover the latent variable. From an empirical perspective, variational autoencoders (VAEs) or their variants are commonly used for this purpose.

3.As shown in Table 1, InfoIV does not perform strongly in causal effect estimation. A more detailed analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes. In particular, the authors should explore why InfoIV performs well on image data but poorly on tabular data.

4.In Section 4.3, InfoIV-CF assumes that the effect of the instrumental variable A on the treatment variable Z is linear, while in Section 5.1, the simulated data uses a nonlinear relationship between A and Z. This inconsistency should be clarified or justified.

### Summary
The paper considers an instrumental variable (IV) regression setting in which the treatment is hidden and only a non-linear transform of it is observed. The paper then proposes to apply a two-step approach called InfoIV: (1) Use a causal representation learning approach to estimate a non-linear transform of the hidden treatments and (2) use the resulting estimated hidden treatments in a two-stage least squares approach.
The authors additionally combine the first step (learning the hidden treatments) with a control function approach that allows them to perform extrapolation on the instrument domain.
Finally, InfoIV is evaluated in three experimental settings: IV on tabular data, IV on image data and extrapolation on the domain of the instrument.

### Strengths
- Good high-level presentation: It was easy to read and understand the paper; it is also nice that the authors provide detailed background on IV for readers less familiar with it.
- Interesting application of causal representation learning: Overall, the idea of using causal representation learning for a concrete problem like this is interesting.

### Weaknesses
- Unclear objective and motivation: While the authors are clear about the setting they consider, my main concern with this work is that the actual problem the authors want to solve is not clear. Given that the variable Z is unobserved, it is unclear to me why we would want to estimate f_0 in this setting. Additionally, given that we actually cannot identify Z but only a coordinate-wise non-linear transformation, it is even less clear why identifying the function in Eq. (7) is useful (this also shows in the experiments, I believe; see below). The extrapolation problem considered in the second half seems much more clearly defined.
- Concerns about experimental evaluation:
  - Recovering latent representation experiments: Why does it make sense to use mean correlation coefficients here? Since the hidden components are only identifiable up to permutations and non-linearities, it seems that one would need a very different evaluation metric.
  - IV experiments: In these experiments, the authors consider an evaluation metric where f_0 is a function of X and not of the hidden variable Z. All baselines should therefore be misspecified in this model, and even the proposed InfoIV method is not intended for this use case. At the very least, regular least-squares regression of Y on X should be applied here (which should actually perform best on the loss if I understand it correctly).
  - Extrapolation: For the extrapolation experiment, I do not understand why in Fig. 2(b) the representations of the MMR (Rep4Ex) approach are worse but the extrapolation of Rep4Ex performs better (aren't the methods InfoIV and Rep4Ex the same apart from how they recover the latent representation, so better representations should lead to better extrapolation?).
- Better clarity on assumptions and conditions would be helpful:
  - Independence between A and eps is often written as required for IV although it is too strong; instead only E[eps|A] = 0 is needed (same is true for least-squares regression with X instead of A). Please be precise about which of them you need.
  - Direct effect from A to X is not needed for IV but is needed for the extrapolation (I think), so it should not appear in Assumption 2.1 (it is also a much stronger assumption than P(X|A) not constant).
  - In Section 4.3, I found it hard to follow which additional assumptions are needed (and which assumptions might not be needed) in the comparison with Rep4Ex.

### Questions
- What application do you have in mind when you want to estimate the causal effects of the latent variables on the outcome?

### Summary
This paper explores the application of ICA-based identifiable deep generative models, particularly Ice-beem (Khemakhem 2022b), to instrumental variable (IV) settings in causal inference. It proposes a framework for identifying the treatment and estimating causal effects when treatments may be latent variables, drawing analogies to traditional IV regression through a two-stage procedure. The approach assumes noiseless injection from low-dimensional treatments to higher-dimensional covariates and demonstrates results in simulated experiments, including image-based scenarios.

### Strengths
The paper is relatively well-presented and easy to read, with clear figures and logical flow in sections.

Applying ICA-based identifiable deep generative models to instrumental variable (IV) settings represents a meaningful research direction.

### Weaknesses
- **Mis-conceptualized Problem Setup**: The core issue is a fundamental misunderstanding of causal interventions in IV frameworks. Treatments cannot be hidden; interventions require *full observability and control* over the variable in question. For instance, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demand extensive effort to *design treatment assignment mechanisms*, which drives their high cost. While theoretically possible, the paper's latent treatment assumption lacks grounding in real-world applications. The authors should identify or propose a plausible scenario where treatments are truly unobservable—none is evident here.

   - **Inconsistent Notation**: Symbol usage is erratic and confusing, likely signaling the conceptual issue above. In the Introduction and Figure 1, $Z$ denotes the treatment; in Section 2, it shifts to $X$; and in Section 3, it reverts to $Z$. This inconsistency is extremely confusing.
   - **Experiment (Section 5.2)**: The experiment treats observed images $X$—not latent variables—as the intervention target, directly contradicting the paper's latent treatment premise. This is unsurprising given the earlier critique: hidden treatments are incompatible with standard intervention paradigms.

- **Weak Connection to IV Regression**: Identification and estimation in IV rely on observed treatments. In theory, it is okay to establish that treatments are recovered from ICA, but then, the method diverges fundamentally from IV. The paper's claim of a "connection" via latent recovery is superficial, resembling vague analogies (e.g., a two-stage least squares procedure). 

- **Unreasonable Noiseless Injection Assumption**: The model assumes deterministic injection from a low-dimensional treatment to high-dimensional covariates $X$, which is mathematically permissible but practically implausible. Even if their dimensionality is the same, in real settings, treatments are rarely deterministically related to covariates. Also, consider causal directions: under what conditions does a treatment affect *all* covariates, deterministically or up to some noise? None comes to mind. Introducing additive noise (a more realistic assumption) would likely invalidate the current estimation approach.

- **Omission of Key Related Work**: The paper neglects recent advances in ICA-based causal effect methods, based exactly on Independently Modulated Component Analysis (IMCA; Khemakhem et al., 2020a,b). Notable omissions include:
  - Wu and Fukumizu (2022): "Intact-VAE: Identifying and Estimating Causal Effects under Limited Overlap" (ICLR 2022). This is the *first* work applying ICA-based identifiable deep models to causal inference.
  - Xu et al. (2024): "Causal Inference with Conditional Front-Door Adjustment and Identifiable Variational Autoencoder" (ICLR 2024).
