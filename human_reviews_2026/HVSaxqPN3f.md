# Once-for-All: Scalable Simultaneous Forecasting via Equilibrium State Estimation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 6, 2

## Abstract
We introduce Equilibrium State Estimation (ESE), a novel paradigm for simultaneous prediction, where multiple interacting systems require separate yet coordinated forecasts. Such scenarios often arise in real-world such as economics and healthcare modeling.  Unlike existing approaches that predict one system at a time, ESE forecasts all systems in a single pass.  It first estimates the equilibrium state across systems, then generates holistic forecasts based on the difference between the current state and the estimated equilibrium.  Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including currency exchange and COVID-19 spread modeling, demonstrate that ESE is at least as accurate as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while being significantly faster.  In addition, ESE integrates seamlessly with conventional predictors, combining their accuracy with its exceptional efficiency and delivering a 10–70× speedup. With linear-time complexity, ESE scales far better than SOTA methods as the number of systems increases. Moreover, it remains accurate under diverse perturbations, establishing ESE as a fast, generalizable, robust, and scalable multi-prediction method.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new method called Equilibrium State Estimation (ESE), designed for the simultaneous prediction of interacting systems. Each system is characterized by a set of attributes whose evolution over time serves as covariates in the prediction process. The objective is to predict a quantity of interest across multiple systems by leveraging the dynamics of these covariates.

The prediction task is decomposed into two components:
1. Total quantity prediction – estimating the overall magnitude of the quantity of interest across all systems.
2. Equilibrium ratio estimation – predicting the relative contribution (ratio) of each system to the total quantity.

The central idea is that while the total quantity may vary dynamically, the relative ratios between systems tend to exhibit greater stability and may evolve toward an equilibrium state. By separating the modeling of the total quantity and the equilibrium ratios, the method aims to achieve more stable and interpretable predictions.

A key aspect of the approach is the use of cointegration to calibrate the equilibrium estimation. The algorithm begins with an initial prediction and iteratively updates or biases the estimates through a correction term L until cointegration is achieved in the predicted signals.

Another noteworthy feature of the method is its agnosticism to the specific model used for predicting the total quantity. While the paper describe as default a simple linear predictor for that component, the framework is flexible and can incorporate any time series prediction model, as shown in the experiments. 

The authors evaluate their method on both synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including currency exchange rates and COVID-19 spread modeling, and analyze the computational complexity of the approach.

### Strengths
The primary strength of the paper is that the proposed method works effectively in practice. The results demonstrate good predictive performance, achieving both reduced computational cost and improved accuracy, which supports the soundness of the approach.

Another strong point is the use of real-world data in addition to synthetic experiments. This empirical grounding gives credibility to the method and shows that it can handle complex, practical scenarios.

The idea of incorporating equilibrium information into the prediction process is particularly interesting. In contexts such as currency exchange rates, equilibrium relationships are known to exist, and explicitly modeling them is conceptually appealing. While one might question whether such equilibria are stable only in the short term, the decision to include this additional information is well-motivated and insightful.

Overall, the framework provides clear benefits: by leveraging equilibrium structure, the method delivers higher accuracy and shorter computation times. The underlying idea is both sound and potentially impactful, with evident relevance for applications where interacting systems evolve toward some form of equilibrium.

### Weaknesses
1. Presentation and Clarity

The most significant weakness of the paper is its presentation. The text is filled with typos and inconsistencies (e.g., line 179: “twp” instead of “two”). The notation used in Algorithm 1 is also problematic: line 166 defines the all-ones vector using np.ones, mixing a pseudo-algorithm written in mathematical notation with Python-specific syntax. This not only assumes familiarity with Python but also breaks the consistency of presentation. Such initialization should be expressed purely mathematically.

There is also significant notation confusion. The paper alternates between A, α, and lowercase a, sometimes apparently referring to the same quantity. In particular, α seems to appear without ever being introduced, leading to unnecessary ambiguity. Variables and concepts often appear before being properly defined. Key terms such as cointegration or even the predictor are introduced abruptly, with unclear formulations. For instance, the description of the predictor as using “log-maximum likelihood” and residuals is either somewhat vague; it would be clearer to describe it as a linear predictor, or define clearly each term in equation 7 and the training procedure.

In general, the mathematical writing and textual explanations are weak. Some sentences are simply ill-formed (e.g., line 212: “which would not work without them”), which undermines the paper’s readability. The result is that a first reading generates many unanswered questions and leaves the reader struggling to follow the logic.

2. Structure and Conceptual Consistency

Beyond language, the paper suffers from structural and conceptual inconsistencies. The first three pages, in particular, introduce several ideas, equilibrium state, utility function, deltas, that are poorly connected to the actual method presented later. Section 2 on equilibrium state feels like filler: it could be merged into the introduction without loss of substance. Many of the definitions provided are trivial observations, such as the fact that the ratios sum to 1, implying that their changes sum to 0. While potentially insightful if leveraged, these points are not exploited in the actual method, which ultimately reduces to linear regression.

As a result, there is a disconnect between the theoretical narrative and the implemented algorithm. The “equilibrium state” terminology seems overemphasized relative to what is mathematically demonstrated.

3. Incorrect or Confusing Derivations

The proof in Appendix E seems wrong or underexplained, as it looks like a circular argument. Either the reasoning is incorrect, or it is poorly explained. In both cases, clarification is needed.

Additionally, the proof title includes the independence sign, which is poor formatting.

4. Missing or Undefined Key Concepts

Crucial concepts such as cointegration are introduced without definition or explanation. The equilibrium estimation process itself is described through an algorithm that updates L and converges when cointegration is achieved, but the mechanism and intuition behind this convergence remain obscure. There is no explanation of why such an iterative correction should work or what motivates its structure.

Overall, the paper spends excessive time on an overextended introduction while neglecting to introduce and justify the most central concepts. The result is a confusing read that obscures what is otherwise a potentially interesting and well-motivated method.

5. Mathematical and Notational Ambiguities

Mathematical definitions lack precision. For instance, the state s is never explicitly placed within a space (e.g., ℝⁿ or a manifold). Similarly, the upper and lower bounds U and L are introduced,should they not simply be denoted as min and max.
The notation with sometimes 4 indices ($\alpha'_{1:n,k,t}$ line 197) is heavy and hard to parse. I would recommend using vector notation and denote time dependence in a functional way, i.e. $\alpha_k(t)\in\mathbb{R}^n,\ k\in ${$1,..,m$} etc. 


Overall, manuscript is currently not fit for publication. Significant effort to improve the presentation and properly introduce the necessary concepts is needed. This poor presentation makes the evaluation of the method itself difficult. The current evaluation will mostly reflect the quality of the presentation rather than the work in itslef. I am willing to revise my rating if the writing improves significantly.

### Questions
It is unclear whether this work is the first to leverage this decomposition between total quantity and contribution between the different ratios. Are there other methods that use similar assumption? In such case benchmarking should also compare with this other methods that also incorporate equilibrium-like assumptions.

Why was this specific formulation chosen for the state estimation? There are some elements of linear regression, as well as the iterative refinement of the correction L. As you mention later, any method can be used as predictor, why wouldn't it be the same for the equilibrium state estimation? For instance an LSTM with a softmax on the last layer? 

What is the use of introducing utility functions and overall section 2, that could not be done by the introduction? 

In computational complexity, you assert linear complexity, which is achieved because you limit the while loop to E iterations. Potentially, the E necessary to achieve good results could scale poorly with dimension, especially in difficult instances. Do you have guaranties, results, empirical evidence, that this is not the case? 

While the idea of an equilibrium for currency exchange is straightforward, what is your justification for COVID data? In general, do you have a framework for when your method would work, beyond the idea of interracting systems. You mention that definitions 1,2,3 must be satisfied, however as I mentioned it hard to connect these to the ESE framework mathematically, beyond general motivation.

### Summary
This paper proposes **Equilibrium State Estimation (ESE)** for simultaneous forecasting across many interacting systems (e.g., currencies or regions). Instead of forecasting each target independently, this paper estimates a shared **latent equilibrium** over systems from attributes, enforces proportionality/conservation constraints, and then allocates the ensemble trend back to each system. A damped iterative solver is used; cointegration tests provide a stopping criterion. For prediction, this paper either uses a parametric trend term multiplied by equilibrium proportions or plugs in an external forecaster to provide the ensemble trend. Experiments on synthetic dynamics, **G20 exchange rates**, and **COVID-19** incidence at multiple granularities show that ESE is competitive alone and often improves error when paired with strong baselines (ARIMA, LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, SCINet, etc.), while offering substantial runtime gains and scaling roughly linearly with systems, attributes, and timesteps.

### Strengths
- **Originality.** This paper casts multi-target forecasting as **equilibrium inference** over an ensemble of interacting systems, then distributes forecasts in one pass—distinct from multivariate series that treat variables within a single system. The explicit proportionality constraints and equilibrium-led allocation are conceptually clean. 
- **Quality.** The framework specifies definitions, constraints, a **cointegration-based** stopping rule, and a clear prediction layer (Eq. 7) or a plug-in mode with external predictors (Eq. 8). The procedure is easy to integrate and analyze. 
- **Clarity.** This paper carefully differentiates ESE from multivariate, multi-compartment, and multi-target settings, provides an algorithm box, and uses intuitive figures/tables across datasets and granularities. 
- **Significance.** Reported results indicate strong **scalability** (empirical linear cost), competitive or improved accuracy, and **large speedups** when ESE is paired with SOTA forecasters—particularly as system count grows.

### Weaknesses
- **Assumptions.** Reliance on conservation-style proportion constraints and fixed ensemble membership may limit applicability where systems enter/exit or totals are non-conservative.
- **Attribute dependence.** Performance hinges on attribute quality/availability; robustness to noisy or missing attributes is not fully characterized.
- **Theory.** The cointegration threshold and damping are reasonable but heuristic; formal guarantees on consistency, bias, and convergence would strengthen the method.
- **Baselines & compatibility.** Some multivariate models (e.g., VAR) are not paired with ESE; a broader set of multi-target baselines would clarify fairness and generality.
- **Evaluation under shift.** More tests under distribution/regime shifts (e.g., shocks, policy changes) would build confidence in real-world deployment.

### Questions
1. **Constraint realism:** How does performance change if conservation is violated or if systems enter/exit? Could soft penalties replace hard constraints?
2. **Attribute robustness:** Please provide sensitivity to attribute noise/missingness and to the estimation of attribute effects; consider regularized or Bayesian estimators.
3. **Stopping & damping:** Ablate the cointegration threshold and damping schedule; is there an automated criterion that balances accuracy and stability?
4. **Shift robustness:** Evaluate under regime changes and non-stationary attributes; compare stability with multivariate baselines.
5. **Compatibility map:** Clarify which multi-target models can be paired with ESE and whether hybrids (e.g., VAR for trend, ESE for allocation) are feasible.
6. **Compute profiling:** Release code and report end-to-end wall-clock, memory, and parameter counts to substantiate linear scaling and speedups.

### Summary
The paper describes Equilibrium State Estimation, that jointly predicts the future states of multiple interacting systems. This work first estimates a latent "equilibrium state" for the entire ensemble of systems, which represents a balanced distribution of their target values based on their current attributes. The prediction is then generated based on the deviation of the current state from this estimated equilibrium, combined with the overall trend of the ensemble. The authors claim that it can provide significant speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy.

### Strengths
· The idea of using a estimated equilibrium state as a basis for multi-system forecasting is innovative.

· The paper's strongest empirical claim is the dramatic computational speedup. The linear complexity w.r.t. the number of systems, attributes, and time steps is clearly demonstrated in the complexity analysis.

· The appendices do a good job of distinguishing the proposed task from related but different concepts like multi-variate forecasting and multi-compartment models, which helps to precisely define the paper's contribution.

· The paper is overall well written with most concepts.

### Weaknesses
· The core assumption is that the ensemble of systems has a meaningful, estimable equilibrium state. While the intuition is grounded in concepts like Nash equilibrium, the direct application to non-adversarial, prediction-based tasks needs stronger theoretical justification. The paper would benefit from a more formal discussion on the existence and uniqueness of such an equilibrium in the contexts presented.

· It seems to me that the equilibrium state is estimated from the attributes, and then the prediction is made based on the deviation from the equilibrium state. However, the attributes are also the primary drivers of the system's evolution. There is a risk of a circular argument where the model is effective simply

because it's using the attributes to create a target (the equilibrium) and then predicting towards it. A deeper ablation study or analysis is needed to disentangle the contribution of the equilibrium concept from simply using the attributes for a clever form of proportional forecasting.

· The initialization of equilibrium state and the choice of the damping coefficient=0.5 seem arbitrary. A sensitivity analysis or a justification for these choices is missing. How sensitive are the final results to these initial conditions and hyperparameters?

· The paper lacks a crucial ablation study. What is the performance of the "Predictor" component (Eq. 7) alone, using a simple or naive weighting (e.g., last observed proportion) instead of the estimated equilibrium state? Appendix N compares to a naive weighting, but this should be integrated into the main experiments to isolate the value added by the complex equilibrium estimation process itself.

· The method may not be generalized. The constraints (Definitions 1-3) are quite strict: all systems must have the same attribute set, and the sum of proportions must be 1. This limits the applicability of ESE. How would it perform if some systems had missing attributes? Or if the ensemble was not "closed"? The G7 vs. G20 analysis (Table 6) hints at this but doesn't fully address the brittleness of the method to its core assumptions.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework called Equilibrium State Estimation (ESE) for simultaneous forecasting across multiple interdependent systems. Each system’s relative proportion to the ensemble total is modeled via an equilibrium state ES_t, estimated iteratively until cointegration between observed and equilibrium series is achieved. Forecasts from any base model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Informer) are redistributed according to these equilibrium proportions, ensuring global consistency.

The approach is tested on synthetic data and two real-world problems: FX rate forecasting (16 currencies) and COVID-19 infection forecasting (320 regions in Australia). Results show improved accuracy and computational efficiency when ESE is added to baseline univariate models.

### Strengths
1. Interpretability: ESE yields equilibrium proportions interpretable as long-run relationships among series (e.g., currency parity, infection equilibrium).
2. Scalability: Computational efficiency is a strong advantage; ESE avoids large multivariate training and scales linearly in the number of systems.
3. Consistency: The paper demonstrates consistent accuracy gains and significant runtime reduction compared to single-model baselines.
4. Clarity: Formulations are precise, and algorithms are clearly presented with explicit steps and convergence tests.

### Weaknesses
1. Restricted baseline comparison: The method is compared mostly against univariate models. No experiments include multivariate or cointegration-based systems (VAR, VECM, DeepVECM, Crossformer), making it unclear whether ESE offers an advantage beyond equilibrium-aware models.
2. Static equilibrium assumption: ESE treats equilibrium adjustment as static. It does not learn or adaptively correct deviations over time (e.g., through error-correction dynamics), limiting performance in regime-switching or non-stationary settings.
3. Lack of theoretical guarantees: No formal convergence or consistency results are provided for the iterative equilibrium estimation process.

### Questions
Could the authors clarify how sensitive the ESE procedure is to misspecified attributes or cointegration test thresholds, whether it can be extended with dynamic or learned error-correction mechanisms such as neural ECM, and provide a clear theoretical justification with conditions under which ESE offers advantages over multivariate time-series models like VAR or VECM?
