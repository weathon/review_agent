- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 4, 8

## Abstract
Human trajectory forecasting is crucial for safe navigation in crowded environments, requiring models that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. Efficiently modeling social interactions is key to performance in dense crowds. Yet, most recent methods rely on attention mechanisms, which are effective at capturing complex dependencies, but incur quadratic computational costs that scale poorly with the growing number of neighbors. Recently, Selective State-Space Models have provided a linear-time alternative; however, their inherently sequential design is misaligned with the unstructured and dynamic nature of social interactions. To address this challenge, we propose Social-Mamba, a forecasting architecture that reformulates social interactions as structured sequential processes. At its core is the Cycle Mamba block, a novel module that enables continuous bidirectional information flow. Social-Mamba organizes agents on a semantically ordered egocentric grid and introduces social triplet factorization, which decomposes interactions into temporal, egocentric, and goal-centric scans. These are dynamically integrated through a learnable social gate and global scan to generate accurate and efficient trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments on five trajectory forecasting benchmarks show that Social-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while offering superior parameter efficiency and computational scalability. Furthermore, embedding Social-Mamba into a flow-matching framework further enhances both accuracy and efficiency, establishing it as a flexible and robust foundation for future trajectory forecasting research.

### Summary
This paper introduces Social-Mamba, a novel and efficient architecture for human trajectory forecasting that replaces quadratic-cost attention mechanisms with a Mamba-based state-space model to achieve linear-time complexity while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. Its core contributions include the Cycle Mamba block, which enables continuous bidirectional information flow for richer context modeling, and a structured social triplet factorization that decomposes interactions into temporal, egocentric, and goal-centric scans processed via semantically ordered sequences on an ego-centric grid. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that Social-Mamba outperforms existing methods in accuracy while significantly improving parameter and computational efficiency.

### Strengths
1. The paper is logically structured and visually coherent, featuring well-designed figures, concise tables, and fluent writing. The clarity of presentation allows readers to grasp the methodology and results with ease.

2. The experimental analysis is thorough and well-executed.

### Weaknesses
1. **Novelty**: Mamba has been available for more than two years, and a large number of studies have already explored its application in various domains. Even within the trajectory forecasting field for both vehicles and humans, several works [1,2,3] have investigated the use of Mamba. Therefore, simply replacing the attention mechanism with Mamba for efficiency improvement is not sufficiently convincing or novel.

2. **efficiency**: Reporting only the number of parameters and GFLOPs is not enough to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. A more comprehensive evaluation—including inference time and memory usage compared with other approaches—is necessary to substantiate the efficiency claims.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Mamba-based trajectory prediction framework that reformulates social interactions as structured sequential processes. The framework is built on Cycle Mamba blocks to enable continuous bidirectional information flow, and introduces social triplet factorization to decompose interactions into temporal, egocentric, and goal-centric scans, which are finally integrated through a learnable social gate and global scan.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents a novel attempt to use sequential state-space models to model unstructured social interaction. 
2. The proposed social triplet factorization provides an interpretable and modular approach to capture different aspects of social interaction. 
3. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining high parameter efficiency and computational scalability. The comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each architectural design, further proving its robustness.

### Weaknesses
1. The strategy of ordering neighbors solely based on their distance to the target agent is not very sound. For example, a farther neighbor in front of the agent, who may potentially encounter the target, could have a stronger social influence than a closer neighbor moving away in the opposite direction. The social grid preparation process could therefore be designed more reasonably by considering more factors rather than distance alone.
2. The writing and presentation could be improved. For example, the complete output $O_{\mathrm{cycle}}$ in Line 223 does not appear in prior equations and lacks explanations. In addition, Eq.13 contains typographical errors that influence readability.
3. The key equations and variables need clearer explanations. Eq.13 and Eq.14 are presented without sufficient clarification of the underlying operations and intermediate variables. In particular, symbols such as $z_{e,t}^"$ are not explicitly defined, which makes it challenging to fully understand the computational flow and the overall method.

### Questions
1. In the social grid preparation process, the neighbors are sorted solely based on their distance to the target agent. Have the authors considered other factors in this process? If not, why it is rational to just use the distance?
2. What is the meaning of the "complete output $O_{\mathrm{cycle}}$ " in Line 223?
3. In Eq.13 and Eq.14, what are the precise definitions of the intermediate variables such as $z_{e,t}^"$? 
4. How does the proposed framework produce multi-modal trajectory predictions?

### Summary
This paper presents Social-Mamba, a trajectory forecasting architecture that adapts selective state-space models (Mamba) to model social interactions. The main technical contributions are (i) the Cycle Mamba block, a bidirectional SSM that concatenates reversed and forward sequences to enable continuous hidden-state flow, and (ii) a social triplet factorization that decomposes social interactions into temporal, egocentric, and goal-centric scans, fused via a learnable gating mechanism and a global scan. The method is evaluated across diverse benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating notable parameter efficiency and computational scalability.

### Strengths
1. **Novel adaptation of SSMs to model social interactions.** The paper offers a thoughtful and original approach to use sequential state-space models to model unstructured social interaction. The Cycle Mamba design is conceptually simple yet effective: it provides a principled way to inject “future” context into forward processing while preserving Mamba’s efficiency advantages.
2. **Interpretable factorization of social interactions.** The social triplet factorization offers a modular and semantically meaningful decomposition of social interactions, which improves interpretability and enables targeted ablations to assess each component’s contribution.
3. **Strong performance and efficiency.** Social-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks while using substantially fewer parameters and GFLOPs than several transformer-based baselines. The presented ablation studies further support the robustness of the architectural choices.

### Weaknesses
1. **Presentation and notation need improvement.** Several notational inconsistencies and typos make the technical flow harder to follow. For example, the "complete output $O_{\mathrm{cycle}}$" referenced around Line 223 is introduced without prior formal definition; Eq. 13 and Eq. 14 use variables (e.g., $z_{e,t}^"$) that are not clearly defined in the main text. The authors should carefully check these issues for better readability.
2. **Neighbor ordering by Euclidean distance is simplistic.** Sorting neighbors solely by Euclidean distance (Eq.9) is a weak heuristic for social importance. The authors should either justify this choice theoretically/empirically or provide experiments that compare alternative motion-aware ordering or weighting schemes.
3. **Incomplete description of multi-modal predictions.** Section 4.3 states the model predicts $K$ trajectories and trains with a best-of-K loss, but it is unclear how the $K$ modes are generated at inference. Clarifying this is important for understanding how diversity is achieved and evaluated.

### Questions
1. The social grid permutation $\pi$ (Eq.9) uses distance at $T_{\mathrm{obs}}$. Have the authors tried ordering by alternative criteria? If so, please report results; if not, please discuss why distance is sufficient and outline how the model might incorporate richer ordering.
2. How are the $K$ predicted trajectories generated? Is the decoder trained to produce $K$ hypotheses deterministically, or are the hypotheses obtained via sampling from a latent distribution?
3. What are the precise definitions for variables in Eq.13 and Eq.14? What are the meaning of the calculation of each term in these two equations?

### Summary
The paper introduces Social-Mamba, a novel architecture for human trajectory forecasting designed to achieve high accuracy while providing superior computational efficiency and scalability compared to conventional methods.  The core innovations include the Cycle Mamba (CM) block, a bidirectional SSM module that ensures continuous information flow; the Ego-centric Social Grid, which resolves the inherent ordering problem of sequential models by sorting neighbors based on distance to the ego agent; and Social Triplet Factorization, which decomposes interactions into temporal, ego-centric, and goal-centric sequential scans aggregated via a learnable social gate. The architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across five benchmarks while demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and computational scalability.

### Strengths
Social-Mamba successfully addresses the critical drawback of attention mechanisms (quadratic computational cost) by utilizing the Mamba framework, offering superior parameter efficiency and computational scalability

The paper adapts the inherently sequential design of SSMs to model complex, unstructured social interactions. This is achieved through the introduction of the Cycle Mamba block, which facilitates continuous bidirectional information flow, and the Ego-centric Social Grid, which imposes a meaningful ordering necessary for sequential processing of spatial data

Despite prioritizing efficiency, Social-Mamba attains state-of-the-art accuracy on five diverse trajectory forecasting benchmarks

The Social Triplet Factorization technique effectively breaks down complex social dynamics into separate, purposeful sequential scans (temporal, ego-centric, and goal-centric), which ablation studies demonstrated yield the best overall performance

### Weaknesses
While the Ego-centric Social Grid resolves the ordering problem inherent to SSMs, the performance may rely heavily on the quality and consistency of the distance-based ordering. This imposed structure might potentially constrain the natural, unstructured dependencies that attention mechanisms were designed to capture, although the performance suggests this constraint is effectively managed.

The design successfully introduces the Cycle Mamba block for continuous bidirectional flow. While this is innovative, ensuring that the imposed sequential structure does not inadvertently introduce causal or temporal biases during the bidirectional scan remains a potential issue not fully detailed in the summary.

### Questions
How sensitive is the performance of the model to alternative ordering strategies within the Ego-centric Social Grid (e.g., ordering by predicted collision risk or goal alignment rather than distance)?

Could the authors elaborate on the specific limitations and future directions discussed in the appendix, particularly concerning scenarios where the Ego-centric Social Grid might inadequately represent crucial, non-distance-dependent social interactions?
