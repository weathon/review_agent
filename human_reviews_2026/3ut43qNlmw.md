## Abstract
High-quality geometric diagram generation presents both a challenge and an opportunity: it demands strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints to guide generation. Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

### Summary
This paper presents GeoLoom, a novel two-stage framework for generating high-quality, geometrically accurate diagrams from natural language descriptions. GeoLoom's approach is to first translate the unstructured natural language into a structured, formal representation, and then use a specialized solver to render the diagram from that representation.

### Strengths
1. Instead of trying to force a single, end-to-end model to understand both language and geometry, the authors intelligently divide the problem. They use LLMs for what they excel at (structured language translation) and a dedicated optimization algorithm for what it excels at (constraint satisfaction). This is a much more robust and interpretable design than a black-box diffusion model.

2. The design of a "generation-oriented" formal language is a key insight. Correctly identifying that languages for solving problems are not sufficient for generating them and encoding "constructive dependencies" (free vs. dependent points ) is a strong conceptual contribution.

3. Creating a new, manually verified dataset of 4,730 paired examples is a substantial effort. This dataset will be essential for benchmarking future work in this domain.

4. The visual comparisons in Figure 4 are definitive. GeoLoom produces clean, mathematically correct diagrams, while the state-of-the-art baselines produce unusable, garbled messes. This is strongly supported by the user study, where GeoLoom (especially the fine-tuned version) was preferred by a massive margin over AutomaTikZ and Seedream.

### Weaknesses
1. The entire pipeline's success hinges on the first step: correct autoformalization. However, the quantitative results in Table 1 show that the "True" accuracy (verified by manual examination) for the best fine-tuned model (Qwen2.5-7b) is only 85.34%. This implies that for ~15% of inputs, the formal language is incorrect from the start. If the GeoLingua representation is wrong, the coordinate solver will perfectly generate the wrong diagram. 

2. The paper repeatedly uses the term "coordinate solver". However, the method described is a stochastic optimization algorithm (Monte Carlo), not a deterministic solver (like a symbolic or constraint-based solver). This approximate method is sensitive to hyperparameters (T, Q)  and may not be guaranteed to find the true global optimum, especially for highly complex diagrams. It could get stuck in a local minimum where constraints are still violated.

3. The current framework and solver are designed exclusively for 2D Euclidean geometry. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the conclusion. This means the system cannot handle 3D geometry or non-Euclidean spaces, which limits its application.

### Questions
1. The ~15% failure rate of the autoformalization step is the system's main bottleneck. Could the authors provide a more detailed analysis of these failures? What are the most common types of errors? Are they simple parsing mistakes (e.g., wrong length value), or deeper semantic misunderstandings (e.g., misinterpreting a "dependence" or "perpendicular" relationship)?

2. Why was a stochastic Monte Carlo optimizer chosen over a deterministic geometric constraint solver? While the MC method is fast, a deterministic solver could potentially find an exact solution without needing to tune iteration hyperparameters (T and Q)  or worrying about local minima. What are the advantages of the optimization approach that outweigh this?

### Summary
The authors introduce GeoLoom, a novel framework for generating high-precision geometric diagrams from natural language descriptions. The method features a two-stage architecture: (1) an autoformalization module that converts natural language into a new formal language called GeoLingua, and (2) a Monte Carlo–based coordinate solver that generates spatially accurate diagrams by minimizing constraint violations. To support this framework, the authors construct GeoNF, a benchmark dataset of 4,730 aligned natural language and formal specification pairs. Experiments use both training-free (e.g., DeepSeek-v3) and fine-tuned LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen) for the autoformalization stage. Evaluation includes geometric constraint metrics (LCI, ADI), human judgment, user studies, and generation speed. GeoLoom consistently outperforms strong baselines like AutomaTikZ and Seedream 3.0 in structural fidelity, efficiency, and user preference.

### Strengths
1. **Strong and novel method.** GeoLingua presents a principled framework for geometric diagram generation. This suggested architectural design is well-supported by strong empirical results: GeoLoom achieves top performance in constraint satisfaction metrics (LCI, ADI), manual accuracy, and user preference in both diagram quality and alignment.
2. **Clear writing and presentation.** The paper is clearly written, with informative diagrams, making the method easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. **Some geometric constraint are hard to understand.** The paper introduces several evaluation equations (e.g., Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 for length/angle relations) using Iverson bracket notation and conditional terms, but does not provide intuition or derivations. It’s unclear how these metrics correspond to geometric correctness or what theoretical justification supports their formulation.
2. **No ablation study on GeoLingua components or constraint types.** The impact of individual constraint types (e.g., length ratio vs angle value) on final diagram quality is not explored, missing an opportunity to better understand what aspects contribute most to structural fidelity.
3. **No extrinsic evaluation.** Beyond constraint satisfaction and human preference, the authors could evaluate their system’s practical utility in downstream tasks. For instance, one could give the generated diagrams as auxiliary inputs to VLMs solving geometry problems (e.g., GPT, Gemini) and measure whether models solve more problems or do so more accurately depending on the diagram source. This would provide a task-grounded measure of diagram quality and educational value.

### Questions
1. It may improve clarity to use consistent terminology between Section 2 (L140–141: “basic geometric primitives”, “point dependencies”, etc.) and the formal language components listed later (L146–156: “shapes”, “dependence”, etc.).
2. In Algorithm 2 line 17, what does the constant 50 mean used for canvas sizing?

### Summary
The paper proposes GeoLoom, which converts natural language geometric descriptions into constrained coordinates through a newly designed formal language called GeoLingua. Then, Monte Carlo optimization is used to generate high-precision two-dimensional geometric diagrams, and a paired dataset called GeoNF and a structural deviation index are constructed. Experimental results show that its structural fidelity is superior to baselines such as Seedream3.0 and AutomaTikZ, and most samples are completed within 10 seconds.

### Strengths
1.For the first time, the "formal language + symbolic solving" paradigm of geometric problem-solving has been transferred to image generation, presenting a novel approach.

2.The self-developed GeoLingua explicitly encodes the construction sequence and constraints, facilitating subsequent coordinate calculations.

3.Quantifiable indicators such as LCI/ADI have been proposed to provide an objective evaluation benchmark for the community.

4.The two-stage process supports two modes: training-free prompts and fine-tuning, which is flexible and easy to use.

### Weaknesses
1.This is only applicable to 2D Euclidean geometry. Non-Euclidean, 3D or dynamic geometry need to be rewritten for constraints and solvers.

2.Monte Carlo random sampling relies on a large number of iterations, often taking over 50 seconds for complex graphs, and the convergence is slow.

3.The grammar of formal languages is fixed. If the description contains advanced concepts such as "similar" or "trajectory", it cannot be expressed.

4.The dataset size is still small, and it only comes from middle school questions. It is insufficient in covering university and competition-level curves and solid geometry.

5.There is no comparison with interactive drawing software (such as GeoGebra), and only compared with the generated model, the persuasiveness is limited.

6.The robustness under noisy text (oral, multilingual) has not been evaluated. Actual classroom input often contains typos.

7.The indicators LCI/ADI only measure relative deviation and are insensitive to topological errors (such as reversed point order), which may be overestimated.

8.No failure sample analysis is provided. Readers cannot know the system boundary and failure modes.

### Summary
This paper introduces **GeoLoom**, a novel two-stage framework for generating high-quality, geometrically accurate diagrams from natural language descriptions. The authors identify that existing text-to-image models fail at this task due to a lack of spatial precision.

The GeoLoom framework consists of:

1.  An **autoformalization module** that translates the natural language input into a newly proposed, generation-oriented formal language called **GeoLingua**.
2.  A **coordinate solver** that takes the formal constraints from GeoLingua and uses **Monte Carlo optimization** to find a set of precise coordinates that satisfy these constraints.

To support this framework, the authors also introduce the **GeoNF dataset**, which aligns natural language descriptions with their corresponding GeoLingua representations. The paper demonstrates that GeoLoom significantly outperforms baselines like AutomaTikZ and Seedream in structural fidelity, as measured by both automated metrics and human evaluation.

### Strengths
- **Significance & Motivation:** The paper tackles a well-defined and significant problem. The authors correctly observe that general-purpose text-to-image models are unsuitable for domains requiring high structural and spatial accuracy, such as mathematical diagrams. An automated tool for this task would have clear applications in education, research, and engineering.
- **Methodological Clarity:** The proposed two-stage, "parse-then-solve" pipeline is logical, interpretable, and well-structured. Separating the natural language understanding (autoformalization) from the geometric constraint satisfaction (coordinate solver) is a strong and principled design choice, drawing inspiration from advances in formal geometry problem-solving. The overall framework is clearly illustrated in Figure 2.
- **Novel Contributions:** The paper provides two valuable resources to the community:
  1.  **GeoLingua:** A formal language designed specifically for _generative_ tasks, which notably encodes constructive dependencies, not just static constraints.
  2.  **GeoNF Dataset:** A new dataset of 4,730 paired natural language and formal language descriptions , which addresses a key bottleneck of high-quality data for this task.
- **Strong Evaluation:** The authors perform a comprehensive evaluation, including:
  - Quantitative metrics (LCI, ADI) derived directly from constraint violations .
  - Manual verification of accuracy ("True" accuracy in Table 1).
  - A qualitative comparison (Figure 4) that clearly shows the limitations of baselines.
  - A human user study that measures both image quality and textual alignment.

### Weaknesses
Despite its strengths, the paper suffers from several weaknesses, primarily concerning the novelty of the paradigm, the scalability of the solver, and a lack of depth in key areas.

- **Missing Comparison to Key Baselines:** The core idea of a text-to-diagram pipeline based on formal language and constraint-based optimization is not new. The related work discusses GANs/diffusion and vector graphics generation, but omits a critical category: constraint-based diagram generation systems. A well-known example is **Penrose** (Penrose: From Mathematical Notation to Beautiful Diagrams, SIGGRAPH 2020), which also uses a formal language and stochastic optimization to generate diagrams. A comparison to this and similar systems is essential to properly contextualize GeoLoom's novelty and performance.
- **Scalability of the Monte Carlo Solver:** The choice of a Monte Carlo (MC) based solver raises significant concerns about scalability.
  - **Efficiency:** MC methods are stochastic and can be very inefficient in high-dimensional or highly-constrained search spaces. The paper claims "superior computational efficiency" and shows that _most_ examples are solved in <10 seconds (Table 3), but this does not constitute a proper scalability analysis. The efficiency will likely degrade exponentially as the number of points and constraints increases.
  - **Robustness:** The solver relies on probabilistically sampling to find a global optimum and avoid "suboptimal configurations". However, the paper provides no discussion of failure cases or an analysis of how often the solver gets stuck in a poor local minimum.
- **Vagueness in Loss Function Details:** The paper defines five types of geometric constraints and a final objective function. It is not clear how these five distinct metrics, which have different forms (ratios, Iverson brackets), are normalized and combined into the single set used in the final loss. For instance, "C_{lin\\_rel}" does not appear to be normalized around 1. This lack of clarity hinders reproducibility.
- **Oversimplified Evaluation Cases:** The examples shown in the qualitative evaluations (Fig. 4, 5, 9) are relatively simple geometric figures (triangles, quadrilaterals). The paper does not demonstrate that GeoLoom can handle highly complex problems with many interacting constraints, such as those found in geometry olympiads (e.g., IMO problems). This reinforces the concerns about the solver's scalability and robustness.
- **Lack of Ablation on Autoformalization:** The system's quality is highly dependent on the correctness of the autoformalization step. The paper mentions a "validation-based filter" to ensure syntactic correctness, but it does not discuss how semantic errors (e.g., misinterpreting a complex relationship) would propagate and affect the final diagram.

### Questions
1.  **Comparison to Penrose:** Could the authors elaborate on the novelty of GeoLoom compared to existing constraint-based diagram generation systems like Penrose, which also use a formal language and optimization-based solver?
2.  **Solver Scalability:** How does the Monte Carlo solver's performance (both in time and accuracy) scale with an increasing number of points and constraints (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 constraints)? The examples shown are simple; have the authors tested GeoLoom on more complex, "olympiad-level" geometry problems?
3.  **Solver Robustness (Local Minima):** Could the authors provide examples of failure cases where the MC solver gets stuck in a poor local minimum and fails to satisfy all constraints? How frequently does this occur, and are there any mechanisms besides random restarts to handle it?
4.  **Loss Function Clarification:** Could the authors please provide a more precise formulation of the objective function $\mathcal{L}(S)\_{max}$? Specifically, how are the five different constraint deviation metrics (e.g., "C_{lin\\_rat}" and "C_{lin\\_rel}" ) normalized and combined into the set $\mathcal{C}$?
5.  **Handling of Fully-Constrained Systems:** The solver is described as "iteratively perturbs the coordinates of free points ($P_f$)". What happens in the case of a diagram that is fully constrained or over-constrained and has no "free points" to perturb? How is the optimization initialized in such a case?
6.  **Error Propagation:** What is the impact of semantic errors from the autoformalization module? If the LLM generates a syntactically valid but _semantically incorrect_ formal description (e.g., `Perpendicular` instead of `Parallel`), the solver would presumably generate a "correct" diagram for the _wrong_ problem. How is this type of error handled or measured?
