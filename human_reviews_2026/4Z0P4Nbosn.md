# TandemFoilSet: Datasets for Flow Field Prediction of Tandem-Airfoil Through the Reuse of Single Airfoils

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 2, 6, 6, 4

## Abstract
Accurate simulation of flow fields around tandem geometries is critical for engineering design but remains computationally intensive. Existing machine learning approaches typically focus on simpler cases and lack evaluation on multi-body configurations. To support research in this area, we present **TandemFoilSet**: five tandem-airfoil datasets (4152 tandem-airfoil simulations) paired with four single-airfoil counterparts, for a total of 8104 CFD simulations. We provide benchmark results of a curriculum learning framework using a directional integrated distance representation, residual pre-training, training schemes based on freestream conditions and smooth-combined estimated fields, and a domain decomposition strategy. Evaluations demonstrate notable gains in prediction accuracy. We believe these datasets will enable future work on scalable, data-driven flow prediction for tandem-airfoil scenarios.

### Summary
The paper presents a dataset of fluid simulations around tandem airfoils, as opposed to single airfoils.  4000 simulations are included in the dataset.  The authors further demonstrate training models on single-airfoil datasets and then fine-tuning them on tandem-airfoil configurations.  This is done in Section 4.4 using multiple NNs as opposed to a single NN.  The datasets all appear to be two-dimensional.  OpenFOAM is used for the CFD simulations.  If I am reading the tables correctly, the errors of their NN predictions appear to range from 0.5-8% for various tests.  A DID discretization is used to represent the solids/flow field.

### Strengths
The paper presents some interesting analysis of what is needed to use a discretization like DID when multiple solids are present in a solid-fluid simulation.  This results in some thoughtful usage of multiple NNs and the "smooth combining" procedure in Section 4.1.

### Weaknesses
- The paper claims that the proposed dataset is more useful than single-foil datasets due to motivations from real-world engineering, yet, no demonstrations are provided of how this dataset helps solve any real engineering problems better than a single-foil dataset.  The paper is thus unconvincing on this point.
- 4000 is a relatively small dataset size in the era of deep learning.  It is not sufficiently justified why this is chosen.
- The data are 2D-only.  Again, the real world is 3D, so it does not seem very useful to have a dataset of mere 2D configurations.
- I also don't think tandem airfoils occur in isolation in the real world.  For instance, they should be attached to cars or airplanes.  A dataset of real-world objects that happen to have tandem airfoils, would likely be more useful.
- The paper appears to use a very niche discretization, DID, as opposed to the various FDM, FEM, FVM, or other discretizations that have been popular in CFD for many decades.  This may limit the usefulness of the analysis in the paper, although the tandem-foil geometries could still be used by other researchers (though that is a pretty trivial contribution).
- Regarding DID and the benchmarks, the high error rates of 0.5-8% would generally not be considered acceptable by CFD researchers.  Classical CFD solvers can get errors down to e.g. machine precision of like 1e-15.  That being said, other methods like PINNs also produce results with high errors.  But there is no comparison of this method to other AI-based methods to justify its performance - perhaps other PINN or similar NN-based methods would do worse, and it's just the size of the dataset that's the constraint.  There are no such comparisons in the paper, though.
- It is not clear that a method like DID is really practical for CFD when it becomes so much more computationally difficult with each object added to a simulation, when compared to typical one-way solid-fluid coupling algorithms that can handle hundreds of thousands of solids just about as quickly as one.

### Summary
TandemFoilSet introduces nine 2D CFD datasets (five tandem-airfoil and four single-airfoil counterparts; 8,104 total cases, 4,152 tandem) spanning cruise, takeoff (ground effect), and race-car regimes across wide ranges of NACA parameters, Reynolds number, Angle of Attack, stagger, gap, and height. The paper also proposes a curriculum/transfer pipeline that (i) pretrains on single-airfoil flows, (ii) smooth-combines single-airfoil predictions into a low-cost estimate of tandem flow, and (iii) uses residual training to refine tandem predictions. Benchmarks with MeshGraphNet (MGN) and an invariant edge-GCN (IVE) show significant MSE reductions and improved force-coefficient errors compared to baselines. Datasets, meshing/solver details (OpenFOAM, (k-\omega) SST), and verification/validation procedures are documented. A notable technical advancement is the extension of Directional Integrated Distance (DID) from single-object to multi-object geometry encoding via a fast “deviation-from-maximum” combination, yielding significant gains over shortest-vector (SV) features alone.

### Strengths
First paired single-to-tandem dataset collection enabling principled curriculum transfer for multi-body aerodynamics (including ground effect). The explicit coupling of dataset design with a smooth-combining + residual strategy is clean and practical. Extension of DID to two-body settings with an efficient approximation is a useful geometry-aware feature innovation.


Datasets cover diverse operating regimes (fixed and random (Re), AoA; stagger/gap/height sweeps), with mesh studies and literature validation for high-(Re) cases. Clear solver/BC documentation for reproducability! Careful ablations isolate contributions from pretraining, smooth-combining, residual learning, and multi-NN decomposition (front/back/upper/lower subgraphs). Reported gains are substantial and consistent across two GNN families. Includes aerodynamic QoIs (lift/drag, boundary-cell errors) in addition to field MSE which is helpful for practitioner relevance.


Timely step toward complex-geometry learning (tandem interactions, ground effect), a frontier problem for CFD surrogates. The “reuse single-airfoil data for multi-airfoil prediction” recipe is likely to influence future multi-body surrogate design.

### Weaknesses
*Scope: steady 2D only*:  All data and benchmarks are steady (RANS) and 2D. This limits conclusions for unsteady or 3D tandem interactions (e.g., vortex shedding, dynamic stall, tip effects), which are central in many applications. The authors acknowledge compute limits and suggest future 3D/multi-airfoil stages, but this remains my main issue

*Architecture diversity*: While the paper focuses on GNNs (MGN, IVE), the current SOTA for accuracy in many learned PDE settings often involves transformer-style operators. Even a small transformer baseline or a clear interoperability plan would bolster the benchmarking story. (See questions for concrete paths.)

*Geometry encoding design space*: DID/SV are well motivated, but the paper could better situate them versus (un)signed distance fields (SDF/UDF), level-set encodings, or constructive solid geometry (CSG) fusion; especially since combining distance fields is a natural operation when moving from single to tandem geometries.

### Questions
I enjoyed reading this paper and how it could encourage the CFD community to adopt more AI tools. Some of these suggestions are (understandably) difficult to execute on a short rebuttable period, but I provide them for the authors to consider for the future. The critical questions I highlight in bold below: 

*Distance-field representations (DIR) via SDF/UDF*: You extend DID to multi-object via a clever, fast combination. Have you considered using an (un)signed distance function as the core DIR, leveraging CAD/CSG-style Boolean merges (min/max, smooth-min) to combine primitives and airfoils? SDFs provide smooth gradients, exact surface normals, and robust interpolation; they could be directionally integrated post-hoc (compute DID on top of SDF), or used directly as multi-channel inputs (distance, normal, curvature). This might (i) simplify multi-body composition, (ii) reduce DID compute, and (iii) improve generalization to arbitrary multi-component layouts. Any reason an SDF-centric pipeline wouldn’t fit your smooth-combining and residual-training framework?

**Transformers on meshes / hybrid models:** Your results champion GNNs; however, many recent surrogate winners are transformer-flavored. Anyway to extend your results? Two concrete suggestions would be to try (a) global tokens atop MGN/IVE (attention across far-field neighbors or via landmark nodes) to better capture long-range tandem wake interactions, (b) Fourier/Transformer hybrids (global spectral mixing for long-range interactions, GNN for local inductive bias). This aligns with the multi-NN approach you already have. 

*Time-dependent extension*: Everything here is steady. How would you extend TandemFoilSet to unsteady flows (URANS/LES) and time-dependent learning? 

**Generalization beyond airfoils / shape systems** You include some non-NACA profiles and race-car ground-effect cases. Could the dataset (maybe in the future) be extended to include bluff-body to stress fundamentally different separation physics? Can you report on how the approach generalizes to configurations (shape, distances, offsets) that are not in the distribution?

**Compute/latency budgeting**: Residual training with freestream and combined-field estimates is appealing because the estimates are cheap. Could you publish wall-time and memory profiles for (a) baseline, (b) pretrain-only, (c) residual-only, and (d) full pipeline so others can match/compare your cost–accuracy tradeoffs?

### Summary
This paper introduces TandemFoilSet, a benchmark dataset for tandem airfoils, comprising five distinct configurations and paired single airfoil cases. The authors argue that no public benchmarks currently exist for these situations, which remain relevant in practical engineering contexts. This makes the dataset a meaningful and practical contribution to the CFD and ML-surrogate modeling community.
The paper further explores how single airfoil data can be used for data augmentation or as part of an incremental training strategy for a neural surrogate model based on the Mesh Graph Net (MGN) architecture.

### Strengths
- The main strength of the paper lies in the rigor and care taken in generating and documenting the dataset. The simulation parameters, convergence studies, and validation details are described thoroughly, which enhances the dataset’s reliability.
- Tandem configurations are still important for various engineered systems, and having a public dataset here fills a clear gap.
- The dataset covers both low and high Reynolds numbers (500 up to 5×10⁶), includes ground-effect scenarios, and reproduces results from established experimental studies (Figures 13–14), lending further credibility.

### Weaknesses
- The dataset is restricted to 2D, primarily NACA 4-digit geometries, and only two-body (tandem) configurations. It’s unclear how well the findings or models generalize to 3D or multi-body scenarios.
- Much of the paper focuses on the benchmark experiments using variants of MGN and a rather elaborate 4-stage transfer learning pipeline. This feels more like a methods paper, even though the main novelty and value lie in the dataset.
- Only MGN variants are tested. It would strengthen the results to include simpler transfer learning or surrogate baselines for context.

### Questions
- Can you confirm that the dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance? What format will it use (HDF5, VTK, or native OpenFOAM)? Will example loading scripts be provided?
- Why were only MGN-based variants considered? Could you compare against simpler transfer learning or domain adaptation approaches, or multi-task setups combining single and tandem cases?
- What do you think is the main contribution of the paper? Is it more a dataset paper or a method paper? The multi-nn inference procedure feels like a methodological description but is stated within a benchmarking setup. I have the impression that the benchmarking setup is somewhat a repurposed method section, and it is unclear why.

### Summary
This paper introduces TandemFoilSet, a new collection of CFD simulation datasets for tandem-airfoil configurations. It also proposes a novel curriculum learning framework designed to reuse single-airfoil simulation data to predict the more complex tandem-airfoil flow fields. This method is presented as a benchmark, involving techniques like freestream-based residual pre-training and a multi-network domain decomposition approach.

However, this paper seems rushed with many internal contradictions. It also blurs its own contribution (a benchmark, or a better training methodology?). In it's current shape, I have to issue reject. But I am open to rebuttal and reconsideration if authors can fix the problems.

### Strengths
1.  The primary contribution is a new, large-scale, public dataset for a complex multi-body aerodynamics problem.[1] This is a valuable artifact for the community, as tandem-airfoil configurations are critical in many engineering applications but under-represented in existing benchmarks.
2.  The dataset appears comprehensive, covering a variety of flow conditions (low and high Reynolds numbers), angles of attack, and geometries, including ground-effect scenarios (Takeoff, Race Car).

### Weaknesses
This paper is not ready for publication and suffers from significant flaws, ranging from internal contradictions to under-evaluated methodological claims.

1.  The paper is rife with basic contradictions, suggesting a rushed submission.
    *   **Dataset Count:** The text repeatedly claims the collection contains "five tandem-airfoil datasets" and "four single-airfoil datasets". However, the paper's own **Table 1** summary clearly enumerates a structure of **three** tandem-airfoil datasets and **six** single-airfoil datasets. This is a critical contradiction regarding the paper's primary contribution.
    *   **Dataset Size:** The abstract claims "over 4000 fluid simulations". The main body and appendix state a total of "8104 cases".
    *   **Dataset Naming:** The naming in Table 1 is ambiguous. For instance, the "TAKEOFF" dataset appears to contain *both* single and tandem cases, further confusing the "5 vs. 4" or "3 vs. 6" structure.

2.  The paper's focus is split. It presents itself as a dataset/benchmark paper, but its novelty is heavily invested in a new, bespoke "curriculum learning" method. A benchmark paper should ideally use established methods for a fair comparison, not a new method that is itself under-evaluated.
    *   This is problematic because the proposed method is not thoroughly tested before. The paper details a 4-part "Multi-NN" architecture (front, back, upper, lower) in Section 4.4.
    *   However, in the experiments (Section 5.3), only a 2-part (front, back) model was tested. The paper admits the "upper and lower fields were excluded due to memory limitations". This admission undermines the method's own claim of being "memory-efficient" and confirms that the paper's core methodological proposal was not actually validated.

3.   The paper's methodological contributions are overstated.
    *   The "First use of freestream condition... as a physics prior for residual pre-training"  is suspect and maybe automatically conducted by previous methods, because previous papers will usually adopt data normalization. If a standard Z-score (mean=0, std=1) normalization was applied, the mean velocity (which is likely the freestream velocity due to the large portion of surrounding meshes) would have been removed automatically. Hence, this "contribution" may simply be a implicitly-effect of standard preprocessing.
    *   Finally, this new method's inference, Table 15, is way to high (about 1/4th of the GT simulation, Table 14); this makes the whole "re-use" questionable due to its high inference cost.

### Questions
1.  Which is the correct dataset structure: the "five tandem / four single" datasets claimed in the text, or the "three tandem / six single" datasets shown in Table 1?
2.  What is the correct total case count for the dataset: "over 4000" (from the abstract) or "8104" (from the main text)?
3.  What specific data normalization (e.g., Z-score, min-max scaling, division by freestream velocity) was applied to the flow fields before training? This is essential for reproducibility and for validating the freestream residual claim.
4.  Given that the proposed 4-part Multi-NN architecture from Section 4.4 was not tested, can the authors clarify if *all* results in the paper were generated using the simplified 2-part model mentioned in Section 5.3?
5. Why is your new "re-use" method so slow? what can be the limitations?
