## Abstract
As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources, compensating data contributors has become a central concern. But how should these payments be devised? We revisit data valuations from a _market-design perspective_ where payments serve to compensate data owners for the _private_ heterogeneous costs they incur for collecting and sharing data.
  We show that popular valuation methods—such as Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley—make for poor payments. They fail to ensure truthful reporting of the costs, leading to _inefficient market_ outcomes. To address this, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namely Myerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We show that Myerson payment is the minimal truthful mechanism, optimal from the buyer’s perspective. Additionally, we identify a condition under which both data buyers and sellers are utility-satisfied, and the market achieves efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentive compatibility into data valuation design, paving the way for more robust and efficient data markets. Our data market framework is readily applicable to real-world scenarios. We illustrate this with simulations of contributor compensation in an LLM based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) marketplace tasked with challenging medical question answering.

### Summary
The paper considers the setting where data owners have private heterogeneous costs and seek to devise a mechanism that maximizes the social welfare while incentivising data owners to truthfully report their data unit costs. The paper shows that LOO and Data Shapley do not incentivise truthful reporting. The paper then adapt the Myerson and VCG payment rules and show that they are incentive compatible and can ensure individual rationality under some conditions. The paper demonstrates one experiment/application with a market for retrieval augmented generation.

### Strengths
1. The problem considered of incentivising data owners to truthfully report their data unit costs and maximise social/individual welfare is important and have real life applications.
2. The paper is generally easy to follow. The figures are helpful.

### Weaknesses
1. It is unclear what are the technical challenges involved and how this work novelly addresses them. It will be helpful to clarify them.
    * Myerson lemma and VCG auction are known to be incentive compatible. These are well-known results from game theory.
    * There are other related works that also ensures IC. What sets this work apart? The data markets paragraph in Sec 2 should be more in depth. 
    * Data Shapley and LOO are designed to ensure fairness and be cost-agnostic. Naturally, they do not incentivise truthful reporting of cost. It should also be clarified (and justified) that the Data Shapley and LOO in this paper differs from the original as social welfare is considered.
2. There should be further justification of the modeling framework in Sec 3, e.g., specific use cases where the buyer/seller interactions can be modelled by $W$.
3. The experiment considered is simple and each $w$ is either $0$ or $1$.

### Questions
1. What are some specific use cases where the buyer/seller interactions can be modelled by $W$? 
2. What is the challenge in this work when adapting Myerson lemma and VCG auction for data valuation?
3. Elaborate on “We note that most of these works often assume known simple structured valuation functions and combinatorial allocations, not suitable for machine learning worlds where the information sharing can happen in continuous space and the buyers’ valuations are directly connected to model performances, which is our focus.” With specific examples and citations.

### Summary
This paper addresses a challenge in data markets for large language models (LLMs): designing truthful and efficient payment mechanisms to compensate data contributors, as traditional data valuation methods fail to account for market dynamics. It demonstrates that popular data valuation methods—Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Data Shapley—incentivize strategic misreporting (over-reporting/under-reporting) when used as pricing rules, reducing social welfare. To solve this, the paper adapts two classic mechanism design frameworks—Myerson payment rule and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism—to data markets, proving they satisfy incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR), and social efficiency (SE). Additionally, it identifies that when buyers’ utility functions are subadditive, payments can be distributed to ensure buyers’ IR, and in unconstrained allocation scenarios, Myerson and VCG payments are equivalent.

### Strengths
1-It targets a timely, high-stakes problem—LLM data sourcing and contributor compensation—amid rising copyright litigation and data scarcity concerns. Unlike prior work focusing on data valuation for ML interpretability, it centers on market design, filling a critical gap between theoretical mechanism design and real-world data trading.

2-The paper’s framework is mathematically sound: it formalizes allocation, utility, and social welfare, provides complete proofs for key claims (e.g., Myerson’s minimality, VCG’s upper bound) in appendices, and derives closed-form solutions for mean estimation markets, ensuring theoretical trustworthiness.

3-The impossibility result clarifies what is unachievable (e.g., private buyer valuations), avoiding overpromises and guiding future research.

### Weaknesses
1-Unrealistic Assumption of Known Buyer Valuations: The main analysis assumes buyers’ performance functions (\(v_i\)) are publicly known, which contradicts real-world practice—LLM entities rarely disclose model performance gains from external data (to protect competitive advantage). While the paper acknowledges this and proves an impossibility result for private buyer valuations, it offers no mitigation strategies (e.g., approximate mechanisms, partial valuation disclosure), limiting the framework’s real-world applicability.

2-The paper only guarantees buyers’ IR when \(v_i\) is subadditive (diminishing returns from data; Theorem 5.3) but provides no solution for superadditive scenarios (e.g., complementary medical data, where combining datasets drives large performance gains). Superadditivity is common in LLM data sourcing, yet the paper labels this an "open question" (Remark 3) without exploratory analysis, weakening the framework’s comprehensiveness.

3-While Myerson is theoretically optimal, its integral calculation (\(\int_{\hat{c}_j}^{\infty} f_j(W^*(u,\hat{c}_{-j})) du\)) depends on optimizing social welfare for all \(u > \hat{c}_j\). For complex \(v_i\) (e.g., non-linear LLM loss functions) or large seller sets, this becomes computationally prohibitive. The paper mentions this issue but offers no approximations or efficient implementations, limiting Myerson’s practical use for large-scale data markets.

4-Most experiments focus on single-buyer settings (e.g., RAG with one user query) or small buyer sets (mean estimation with |B|=5). Multi-buyer data markets (e.g., multiple LLMs competing for the same medical dataset) introduce externalities (e.g., price competition) that the framework claims to handle but does not validate experimentally, raising doubts about scalability.

### Summary
This paper tackles a timely problem of designing a fair data-trading market where data creators are compensated fairly and data buyers are able to improve model performance.

Traditional data attribution methods like Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley incentivise data owners to misreport their data prices. This paper proposed to use the well-known Myerson payments and VCG mechanism to design fair data trading framework. The core analysis shows: (i) the Myerson payment rule yields the minimum possible payment, making it optimal from the buyer’s standpoint; and (2) when allocations are made to maximize overall market welfare in an unconstrained setting, the VCG and Myerson payments coincide.

As an example, the authors demonstrate contributor compensation in an LLM based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) marketplace for medical question answering.

### Strengths
1. The problem of fair and truthful compensation for data owners is extremely timely and impactful given the increasing infringement of copyright laws by large AI corporations.

2. While the strength of this work is not necessarily a contribution to the mechanism design literature, its novelty lies in adaptation of well-known VCG and Myerson mechanism to an important problem.

3. The application demonstrated in a RAG setting is practically useful.

### Weaknesses
1. For a non-expert reader, the theoretical parts of the paper are hard to read and understand especially since most proofs are deferred to the Appendix. While I have some background in mechanism design, I was not able to understand and verify all the proofs. 

2. The paper assumes that buyers' valuations are known, i.e., how valuable is a certain data point to improving a give model. How practical is this assumption given that most closed-source companies barely reveal anything about their modelling process? Some justification for this assumption should help.

3. While the pretext of the paper is designing fair data-markets, there is a gap between the theoretical results shown and the practical application demonstrated. The RAG application is more like an inference setup while a lot of the discussion leading up to the theoretical results seems catered to selecting pre-training data for models. I am not sure if the proposed VCG mechanism generalises to a pre-training setup since it is nearly impossible to quantify impact of (absence of) one data point in the train set.

### Questions
1. Can you provide some justification to the assumption of known buyer valuations? Perhaps some practical examples will help.

2. Have you thought about how this kind of a setup can be applied to a pre-training setup? Perhaps in each epoch, the buyer can choose data that is most helpful for the model to improve and the data buyers are compensated accordingly? In earlier epochs, perhaps simpler kinds of data (like school level math) will be compensated more than in later epochs, more advanced kinds of data (like olympial level math) can be compensated more?

### Summary
This paper revisits data valuation through the lens of market design, arguing that popular valuation methods such as LOO and Data Shapley are not incentive-compatible and thus lead to inefficient data markets. The authors adapt Myerson and VCG mechanisms to the data trading setting, proving that Myerson payments are the minimal truthful mechanisms optimal for buyers. Theoretical results are complemented by simulations in mean-estimation and RAG markets, showing that the proposed mechanisms maintain truthfulness and individual rationality while existing valuation methods do not.

### Strengths
1.	The paper provides a theoretically rigorous treatment of incentive-compatible payment mechanisms in data markets, grounded in formal mechanism design and supported by detailed proofs.
2.	The paper clearly identifies the limitations of existing valuation methods, such as LOO and Shapley, by showing their vulnerability to strategic misreporting and inefficiency in market collaboration.
3.	The paper effectively adapts classical mechanisms such as Myerson and VCG into a buyer-optimal framework and validates their practicality through an illustrative real-world RAG marketplace example.

### Weaknesses
1.	The paper lack analyze some related data pricing work, such as model-based data pricing[1]. This pricing approach may not present the challenges mentioned by the paper. 
2.	Myerson and VCG mechanisms can be expensive, but the article has no discussion of approximate or scalable variants.
3.	The known and continuous buyer valuation assumption is unrealistic for real-world ML markets; the impossibility result for private valuations reduces generalizability.

### Questions
1. Could the Myerson or VCG payments be approximated efficiently for large-scale data markets?
2. In the RAG experiment, how consistent are the payment outcomes across different LLM judges or domains?
3.Would the same results hold if multiple buyers had private valuations (i.e., two-sided uncertainty)?
