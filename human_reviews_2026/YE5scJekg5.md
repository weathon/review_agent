# DM4CT: Benchmarking Diffusion Models for Computed Tomography Reconstruction

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 2, 6

## Abstract
Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While Computed Tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark nine recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at zenodo.org/records/15420527, and the codebase is open-sourced at github.com/DM4CT/DM4CT.

### Summary
The manuscript introduces **DM4CT**, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating diffusion-model–based methods for CT reconstruction across medical, industrial, and synchrotron datasets. The work fills an important gap in benchmarking diffusion priors for CT, offering a unified taxonomy, shared backbones, and multi-regime evaluations, including a newly released real synchrotron dataset. The results are insightful: no single diffusion approach dominates, and the trade-off between data fidelity and prior strength is clearly demonstrated. The taxonomy of conditioning strategies—data-consistency gradients, plug-and-play, pseudoinverse guidance, and variational Bayes—is well-structured, and nine diffusion-based and seven classical baselines are compared under a fair setup. Shared latent and pixel diffusion backbones are trained per dataset to ensure fairness, and evaluations span multiple sparsity and noise regimes. Overall, the findings indicate that diffusion models are competitive with classical or MBIR methods but often fall slightly behind a supervised SwinIR baseline in PSNR/SSIM.

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive and impressive baselines.**  
The range of baselines included is remarkably complete, even surprisingly so. The authors compare not only traditional iterative methods but also a large set of mainstream DM-based inverse solvers, including those not originally designed for CT reconstruction. They further include state-of-the-art supervised models and even classical self-supervised methods such as DIP and INR. This level of comprehensiveness greatly enhances the paper’s value and allows readers to truly understand how much diffusion-based solvers advance CT reconstruction over prior paradigms. Such a thorough comparison is rarely seen in previous work.  

- **Unified framework for DM-based inverse solvers.**  
A major contribution of this work is the unification and implementation of recent state-of-the-art DM-based inverse solvers under a common interface. Many of these methods have never been applied to CT reconstruction but were validated in other imaging domains. Bringing them together under a consistent framework is a significant service to the CT community and will facilitate the development of more advanced inverse solvers in the future.

### Weaknesses
1. **Small-scale training data.**  
Although the authors trained both latent and pixel diffusion models within a unified Diffuser framework, a major concern is the extremely small size of the training datasets. Even the largest dataset, AAPM 2016, contains only about 5,000 slices. In contrast, diffusion models used in natural image inverse problems are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet, which contain millions of images. Models trained on such small data are likely to overfit or memorize training samples. While the benchmark may still provide relative performance comparisons among diffusion-based solvers, it cannot accurately reflect their true potential on large-scale data, nor the absolute advantage of diffusion priors over classical or learned reconstruction methods.  

2. **Missing key baseline DDS [1].**  
Although many DM-based solvers are included, the benchmark omits the crucial **DDS** method. While DDS can loosely be categorized as a pixel-domain data-consistency optimization, it does not strictly follow the plug-and-play paradigm. In fact, DDS empirically finds a strong balance between prior and data consistency through a conjugate-gradient scheme and empirically chosen step size. I strongly recommend including DDS in future comparisons.  

3. **Limited diversity of experimental settings.**  
Experiments are conducted under only four configurations. Although these capture different regimes, the experimental coverage still feels limited for such an ambitious benchmark.  

4. **Limited real-data evaluation.**  
The real-projection evaluation uses only two rock samples. I appreciate that the authors conducted real-data experiments, which indeed demonstrate the method’s applicability to high-resolution CT. However, for broader impact, it would be valuable to include real medical CT data. I noticed that the authors conducted medical CT reconstruction experiments in the appendix. However, these experiments mainly serve to illustrate the potential value-range mismatch issue between HU-normalized training and real-world data. Moreover, only quantitative results are provided, without any qualitative visualizations. I encourage the authors to include more comprehensive experiments on real medical projection data.

5. **Limited evaluation metrics.**  
The study mainly reports PSNR and SSIM. Although these are standard metrics, they do not capture diagnostic quality, which is critical in medical CT. For example, in Figure 13, particularly under Config 2 and 3, the supervised method achieves the highest PSNR and SSIM but produces reconstructions that are severely blurred and anatomically meaningless—an instance of “high scores but clinically useless results.” While the appendix includes LPIPS and data-fit metrics, these still fail to reflect whether key anatomical structures are correctly reconstructed. I encourage the authors to include more diverse evaluation strategies, such as downstream segmentation accuracy, organ-volume error, or even radiologist scoring.  

6. **Limited generalization analysis.**  
The paper does not address an essential aspect of generalization—cross-dataset robustness. I encourage the authors to evaluate across datasets collected under different protocols or vendor settings. Since AAPM 2016 volumes are relatively homogeneous, this would significantly enhance the completeness of the benchmark.

---
Despite these issues, the paper remains a valuable and well-structured contribution. I encourage the authors to address these concerns in a revised version, which would substantially improve the paper’s quality and impact. If these improvements are made, I would consider increasing my score. I genuinely hope this line of inquiry will continue, as it has strong potential to advance CT reconstruction research.

### Questions
1. For the medical CT configuration (Config 1), none of the methods seem to produce reasonable results for 40-view noiseless sparse-view reconstruction. Surprisingly, most DM-based methods almost completely fail, while the self-supervised INR baseline—though blurry—still reconstructs the main anatomical structures. Is such failure expected in this simplest setup?  
2. The INR-based approach consistently performs well across CT scenarios, especially in low-noise and real-data regimes. In Figure 2 (industrial Config 2), it is the only method that correctly reconstructs the main structural shape, while all others fail. This suggests that INR has a unique advantage in preserving structure, albeit at the cost of sharpness. This naturally raises the question: could combining INR with diffusion priors yield further gains? Recent works, such as **DPER [2]**, have explored this direction, and it may be valuable for the authors to discuss or reflect on this possibility.  
3. In my own experience training diffusion models on the AAPM 2016 dataset, I observed an interesting phenomenon: with such a small dataset (~ 5k slices), diffusion models overfit easily. Early-epoch models generate poor unconditional samples but produce better reconstructions when used as priors, while later-epoch models generate visually impressive samples yet degrade in reconstruction quality. This effect lessens on larger datasets (~100k slices). I encourage the authors to verify whether this occurs in their experiments, as it could be a useful observation and reinforces the need for larger-scale training.  
4. There is a typo in line 420 of the manuscript: “Figure 6a” and “Figure 6b” should be corrected to “Figure 7a” and “Figure 7b,” respectively.

### Summary
This paper provides a benchmark on CT reconstruction algorithms on different datasets and settings.

### Strengths
1. As far of my knowledge, this paper provides a first comprehensive benchmark of current SOTA CT reconstruction methods. This benchmark is very comprehensive, consisting of INR-based methods, pixel-diffusion methods, latent-diffusion methods, MBIR methods, traditional methods, and transformer-based methods.
2. The codebase is maintained very well and easy to use. The code is easy to follow and I can switch between different methods. The code style is great and different classes of methods are separated clearly. Furthermore, it combines a lot of algorithms very simply in just a couple of python files.
3. The benchmark on different datasets is comprehensive and easy to interpret. 
4. The analysis is also insightful. I appreciate the discussion on the tradeoff of latent gradient-based approach and external optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. Including some GAN-based methods will strengthen this paper. If authors have time, I would also encourage trying some Gaussian splat based methods as these methods are gaining more popularity recently. 
2. If authors have time, I am also interested in the performance of flow-based methods, such as FlowDPS or so on.
3. I would encourage the authors to fine tune from some pretrained autoencoder, specifically that from SDXL or SD3, instead of training from scratch, as training from scratch may lose some generalization capability. 
4. For external consistency optimization, there is usually a necessity of using early stopping by noise level adaptively based on diffusion timestep. Also, the choice of latent optimization v.s. pixel optimization can be crucial (more noise level probably more latent optimzation). I understand that this setting can be tricky, but I encourage authors to adopt some hyperparameter tuning to see whether this will solve the artifact problem in the external-consistency relied methods (Especially for latent diffusions).
