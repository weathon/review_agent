## Abstract
Antibodies are essential for viral neutralization and therapeutic applications. However, non-human antibodies can provoke anti-antibody immune responses, prompting the development of humanization strategies to reduce immunogenicity. Most existing approaches focus primarily on improving humanness scores from a sequence perspective,  often overlooking the structural stability of humanized antibodies, which is essential for preserving complementarity-determining region (CDR) conformations. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hu-MCTs, a two-stage framework comprising (1) a pretraining phase that learns latent representations of human antibody sequences, and (2) a humanization phase that optimizes murine sequences toward human-like sequences using a novel black-box optimization algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. This algorithm jointly considers humanness and structural integrity,  particularly minimizing disruption to CDR conformations. Experimental results demonstrate that Hu-MCTs outperforms baseline methods by achieving higher humanness scores while better preserving CDR structural stability. Moreover, the generated sequences exhibit the highest biological plausibility scores, closely resembling natural antibodies. These results suggest that Hu-MCTs is an effective solution for humanizing antibodies while preserving key structural features for functionality.

### Summary
This paper proposes a pipeline that combines PLM-guided initialization, CVAE-based generation, MCTS global search, and CMA-ES local optimization for antibody humanization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher humanness scores while better preserving CDR structural stability.

### Strengths
1.	It clearly clarifies the key issues in current antibody humanization work and proposes an integrated pipeline to improve antibody humanness while preserving structural integrity.
2.	The problem of antibody humanization is crucial for real-world therapeutic applications.

### Weaknesses
1.	Although I appreciate the real-world value of this work, the paper reads primarily as an application study that integrates existing AI techniques for use in the antibody domain. As such, it may be more suitable for a journal focused on antibodies or biotherapeutics, also given that all of the compared baselines are drawn from the bioscience literature.
2.	The writing of the technical part is not clear. Several symbols used in the algorithms are undefined, making the methods difficult to fully understand. In addition, the section describing the use of MCTS for latent space search (Lines 206–215) is hard to follow.
3.	The proposed method considers the structural integrity mainly by using the reward of structural stability. I am concerned that the paper may be overlooking more advanced sequence–structure co-design frameworks.

### Questions
1.	For training CVAE, are the $x$ and $c$ both extracted from the human sequences? If so, would it be a generalization issue when applied such a trained CVAE to humanization where $c$ would be from the murine antibody’s CDR.

### Summary
This paper introduces Hu-mAb, a novel model for antibody humanization that preserves structural stability. Hu-mAb integrates an antibody protein language model with a black-box optimization strategy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The model is first pretrained on extensive datasets of human antibody sequences to capture human-like sequence representations. During optimization, MCTS employs a composite reward function that jointly balances sequence human-likeness and structural stability. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that Hu-mAb effectively humanizes antibodies while maintaining their structural integrity.

### Strengths
This paper effectively integrates protein language modeling with optimization techniques, addressing the issue of structural stability degradation observed in previous approaches. The proposed model jointly optimizes for both human-likeness and structural stability, enabling balanced and biologically meaningful antibody design. Moreover, this multi-objective optimization framework holds promise for extension to additional antibody properties, paving the way for more versatile and comprehensive antibody engineering.

### Weaknesses
The paper shows the effectiveness of antibody humanization. However, most of the evaluations are humanization for murine antibodies. The humanization ability of other types of antibodies remains unknown.

### Questions
1. In Table 2, it seems many baseline methods have higher mutation precision than Hu-MCT. Could the author provide more explanation on this?
2. Table 12 shows that the humanization runtime of Hu-MCTs is significantly slower than that of many baselines. Could the author discuss this tradeoff between runtime and accuracy in more detail?

### Summary
This paper introduces **Hu-MCTs**, a structure-aware antibody humanization framework that combines:
- **Protein Language Model (PLM)** for initialization,
- **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** for paired heavy/light chain latent representation,
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** with CMA-ES for multi-objective optimization.

The key contribution lies in optimizing humanness and structural integrity simultaneously in latent space, explicitly penalizing CDR conformational disruption. Experiments on Humab25 and HuAb348 datasets show improvements over baselines (Sapiens, Hu-mAb, Humatch, CUMAb) in humanness scores (OASis, T20, germline identity) and structural RMSD.

### Strengths
- **Novelty**:
The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with CVAE-based latent space sampling for antibody humanization is novel and well-motivated. The multi-objective design that balances humanness and structural stability is a strong contribution.

- **Comprehensive benchmarking**:
The study compares Hu-MCTs against five baselines (Sapiens, Hu-mAb, Humatch, CUMAb, and experimental sequences) across multiple metrics including humanness, RMSD, pairing quality, and plausibility. Thorough comparision with the baselines clarifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of structural evaluation**:
The study does not evaluate whether the humanized antibodies maintain antigen-binding functionality. While structural RMSD is used as a proxy for stability, it does not guarantee binding affinity. Including computational affinity prediction would strengthen the practical relevance of the results.

2. **Lack of inference time evalutation**:
The framework does not report inference time breakdowns for each stage of the pipeline (e.g., PLM initialization, CVAE encoding, MCTS search, CMA-ES refinement, and structure prediction). This omission makes it difficult to assess computational bottlenecks and scalability in practical settings.

### Questions
1. **Structural evaluation**: Could the authors provide an analysis of antigen-binding affinity through computational prediction tools such as AlphaBind [1]? How well do the RMSD of CDRs correlate with binding affinity?

2. **Inference time evaluation**: Could the authors provide a breakdown of inference time across different stages of the pipeline? and how does each stage scales with antibody sequence length?

3. **Reward function sensitivity**: How sensitive is the MCTS reward function to the weighting parameters? It would be helpful to include a trade-off graph between humanness and structural metrics by varying the reward weighting parameters. This would help validate the robustness of the multi-objective design.

### Summary
The paper proposes Hu-MCTs, a two-stage framework for antibody humanization that combines a pre-trained conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for paired heavy/light chain modeling with a novel black-box optimization algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The method jointly optimizes humanness (measured via OASis, T20, and germline identity) and structural integrity (via CDR loop RMSD using Tfold-predicted structures). The authors claim their approach outperforms existing methods—including Sapiens, Hu-mAb, Humatch, and CUMAb—by achieving higher humanness while better preserving CDR conformations, especially in LCDR1 and HCDR3. They also report superior biological plausibility scores using AntiBERTy.

### Strengths
1. The problem is clinically and scientifically important: balancing immunogenicity reduction with structural/functional preservation in antibody humanization remains a key bottleneck.

2. The integration of structural metrics (RMSD) into the optimization loop is a notable step beyond purely sequence-based methods.

3. The experimental evaluation is reasonable, including multiple datasets (HuAb348, Humab25), diverse baselines, and post-hoc validation with AlphaFold3.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of true functional validation: While structural preservation (RMSD) is measured, there is no assessment of antigen-binding affinity or neutralization activity—the ultimate functional criterion. Without this, claims about “preserving functionality” remain speculative. Even CUMAb uses Rosetta energy minimization as a proxy; Hu-MCTs relies solely on geometric similarity.

2. Questionable reward formulation: The reward is defined as Reward(z)=α⋅Shuman−β⋅Sstab . However, the paper does not justify the choice of linear combination or hyperparameters α,β . This risks arbitrary trade-offs—e.g., the ablation shows humanness increases when structural terms are removed, suggesting the current weighting may be suboptimal or masking a fundamental tension.

3. Computational cost vs. practical utility: At ~50 minutes per antibody (vs. seconds for Sapiens/Humatch), Hu-MCTs is unlikely to scale to high-throughput settings. The paper does not discuss whether the marginal gains in humanness/structure justify this cost, especially since wet-lab validation would still be required.

4. Overstated novelty: MCTS for black-box molecular optimization has been used before (e.g., Yang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022, cited by the authors). The application to antibody humanization is new, but the core algorithmic components are repurposed rather than fundamentally reimagined.

5. Evaluation bias: The “Experiment” baseline includes only 25–348 examples, while Hu-MCTs is evaluated on the same set it was implicitly tuned on (via OAS training). There’s no cross-species or out-of-distribution test to assess generalization.

### Questions
1. Functional relevance: Can the authors provide any evidence—computational or experimental—that the humanized antibodies retain antigen-binding affinity? Even docking scores or paratope stability metrics would strengthen the claim of functional preservation.

2. Reward design: How were α and β chosen? Was a Pareto front explored? Could the method support user-defined trade-offs (e.g., prioritize structure over humanness for difficult targets)?

3. Runtime bottleneck: What fraction of the 50-minute runtime is spent on Tfold predictions vs. MCTS vs. CMA-ES? Could faster structure proxies (e.g., geometric constraints, distance maps) reduce cost without sacrificing fidelity?

4. Coudl you add the comparison with HuDiff?

5. Failure cases: Are there examples where Hu-MCTs fails to preserve CDR structure despite high humanness? Understanding failure modes would clarify limitations.

6. Comparison fairness: CUMAb uses Rosetta for energy minimization, yet Hu-MCTs uses Tfold (or AlphaFold3 post-hoc). Would CUMAb’s performance improve if evaluated with the same structural predictor? A head-to-head comparison using identical structure models would be more rigorous.
