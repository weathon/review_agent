## Abstract
We study the contextual pricing problem, where in each round a seller observes a context, sets a price, and receives a binary purchase signal. We adopt a semi-parametric model in which the demand follows a linear parametric form composed with an unknown link function from a $\beta$-Hölder class. Prior work established regret rates of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ for $\beta=1$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/5})$ for $\beta=2$. Under a uni-modality condition, we propose a unified algorithm that combines the stationary subroutine of Wang & Chen (2025) with local polynomial regression, achieving the general rate $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$ for all $\beta \ge 1$. This recovers and strengthens existing results, while also addressing a gap in the prior analysis for $\beta=2$. Our analysis develops tighter semi-parametric confidence regions, removes derivative lower bound assumptions from earlier work, and offers a sharper exploration–exploitation trade-off. These insights not only extend theoretical guarantees to general $\beta$ but also improve practical performance by reducing the need for long forced-exploration phases.

### Summary
The paper studies contextual dynamic pricing with binary purchase feedback under a semi-parametric single-index model: the expected demand takes the form $g\left(c_t^{\top} \theta-p_t\right)$, where $g$ is unknown and $\beta$ Hölder smooth, for some known $\beta \geq 1$. They design an algorithm based on local polynomial regression that achieves regret $\bar{O}\left(T^{(\beta+1) /(2 \beta+1)}\right)$ for all $\beta \geq 1$, matching previous works for $\beta=1,2$. Assumptions include bounded contexts, a strong unimodality/curvature condition around the revenue maximizer, and a context diversity condition only during the short exploration phase.

### Strengths
Overall, the paper's primary strength is that it achieves the semiparametric optimal regret rate uniformly for all $\beta \geq 1$, addressing a long-standing challenge since Fan et al. (2024). Two additional notable contributions are: 

(1) the demonstration that the use of local polynomial regression effectively shortens the exploration phase, achieved without imposing a boundedness assumption on the covariance of the context, and 

(2) the establishment of joint convergence of $(\theta, g)$, which I believe is of independent interest to the statistical literature.

### Weaknesses
The main limitation is that a similar result has already been achieved by [1]. Their approach is closely related, and their parameter $\mathrm{\beta}$ can also lie in $(0,1)$, not only on $[1,\infty)$. Additionally, $\beta$ might be unknown. In this latter case, they propose an algorithm that maintains the same lower bound $\Omega(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$. It would strengthen the paper to clarify how your contribution differs from or improves upon this prior work. A good position on this would raise my score.

### Questions
1. I find the content of the paper really interesting, but it could be arranged better; for example, by finding some space for the related works and conclusions, and by retaining only the essential material in the main text. In particular, I think that Algorithm 4 in Appendix C is important enough to be at least mentioned or summarized in the main part, since it plays a role in the exploitation phase.

2. It would be helpful to include an explicit remark in the main text explaining how the boundedness assumption on the covariance of the context can be avoided. If I am not mistaken, the key point lies in Equation (12), which essentially shows that the ``transformed'' $U$-based covariance matrix is controlled (specifically, equal to $[\beta] + 1$).

3. I am not sure about Footnote 3. It would be clearer if you specified which sub-results hold under the adversarial case and which do not. For instance, Theorem 9 (and subsequent results) hold under the stochastic setting (i.i.d. and stationary covariates). The sentence ``we keep our discussion in the stochastic setting mainly for clarity'' makes the scope somewhat confusing.

4. The usage of the term "uniformly" is somewhat confusing. For example, in Proposition 9, the uniformity over all $x$ appears to relate to $\sup_x \|\hat{g} - g\|$, but the upper bound itself depends on $x$. This made me think that you might instead be referring to the intersection of events over all $x$ as in (3). If that is the case, perhaps the phrase "simultaneously for all $x$'' would be less ambiguous. The same clarification applies to other results, such as Lemma 16.

5. In Proposition 8, do you mean that the sequence $\{\xi_i\}$ (instead of $y_i$) is mutually independent given $x$?

6. In Theorem 9, you use the notation $\mathcal{T}_j^{ro}$, but I could not find where it was defined.

### Summary
This paper studies the contextual dynamic pricing problem under a semi-parametric reward model. The authors propose a unified algorithm that achieves a regret bound of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (T^{(\beta+1)/(2\beta+1)})$ for general smoothness levels $\beta \ge 1$. The general setting with arbitrary $\beta \ge 1$ has previously been explored only by Fan et al. (2024), whose method attains a much slower rate of  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (T^{(2\beta+1)/(4\beta-1)} )$. The proposed rate therefore improves upon prior work and, in particular, matches the minimax-optimal rates for the special cases $\beta = 1$ and $\beta = 2$ established in the literature. 

The paper’s main theoretical contribution lies in an improved analysis that bypasses the dependence issue in the joint estimation procedure and relaxes the eigenvalue lower bound condition, thereby significantly shortening the required exploration period.

### Strengths
This paper makes a strong theoretical contribution to the study of semi-parametric dynamic pricing, extending sharp regret guarantees to general smoothness levels $\beta \ge 1$.
The theoretical analysis is ambitious and technically nontrivial, especially the part dealing with the dependence structure and the weaker eigenvalue lower bound condition.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper includes no numerical experiments, either simulations or real data. Adding such experiments and comparing the results with existing methods would help demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed algorithm, especially for smoother settings with $\beta > 2$.
    
2. The authors emphasize in the Contributions section that they address a key challenge: the dependence caused by reusing the same samples $\mathcal{T}_j$ to compute both $\widehat{\theta}_j$ and $\widehat{g}_j(\cdot \mid \cdot)$. However, the main text does not clearly explain how this dependence is theoretically handled. 

3. Section 5 is hard to follow. For instance, Proposition 11 is not sufficiently motivated or explained and only becomes understandable after reading Section 6.

### Questions
1. What is the performance of the proposed method under adversarial settings as studied in recent works such as Fan et al. (2024), Wang et al. (2021) and Tullii et al. (2024).
    
2. The theoretical results assume that the smoothness parameter $\beta$ is known.  Can the algorithm be adapted automatically to unknown $\beta$?
    
3. Could the authors provide simulation results or comparisons with existing algorithms to clarify the empirical performance of the proposed method?
    
4. Please clarify how the proposed analysis bypasses the dependence issue between $\widehat{\theta}_j$ and $\widehat{g}_j(\cdot \mid \cdot)$.

### Summary
This paper investigates the dynamic pricing problem, where a seller determines the price based on users’ contextual features (such as user information, time, and region) and learns the optimal pricing strategy from the observed purchasing behavior. The authors propose a semi-parametric model that combines a linear component with an unknown smooth function component to describe the variation of user demand with respect to price. They further develop a pricing algorithm that achieves a unified optimal regret bound across different smoothness levels β. Specifically, the study provides a unified treatment of contextual pricing problems under varying smoothness conditions β, overcoming the limitations of prior works restricted to β=1 and β=2. In algorithmic design, the method refines parameter estimation through local polynomial regression and constrained least squares, thereby improving convergence rates. The paper also reexamines the work of Wang & Chen (2025), identifies gaps in their proof, and provides stricter dependence control and theoretical analysis. Overall, the work demonstrates clear novelty in both theoretical depth and algorithmic design. By establishing a unified analytical framework across different smoothness levels β, it fills the theoretical gap in prior studies that only addressed specific values of β without a general analysis.

### Strengths
Relevance: The paper focuses on a contextual dynamic pricing problem of significant research value. By introducing semi-parametric estimation into dynamic pricing, it contributes to balancing model interpretability and flexibility.

Theoretical Work: The paper presents a unified upper bound on regret that continuously covers the entire range from β=1 to infinity. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the derivations are logically structured and well-organized.

### Weaknesses
Assumptions: The practical validity of assumptions is limited. (a) The strong uni-modality assumption (Assumption 3) may not hold in real pricing scenarios. The authors are advised to discuss the economic meaning, applicability, and necessity of this assumption in the main text. (b) The initial diversity assumption (Assumption 4) depends on the distribution of contexts, which may be difficult to guarantee in real-world deployments. The paper should discuss the potential effects when this assumption is violated.

Experiments: The experimental section is weak. (a) There is a lack of comparative baselines; the proposed method should be evaluated against representative approaches. (b) Purely theoretical results are insufficient to demonstrate robustness. It is recommended to include empirical comparisons under different smoothness levels β to strengthen the persuasiveness of the framework.

Validation: (a) While the research topic is practically meaningful, the paper mainly discusses theoretical pricing models, leaving a noticeable gap from real-world platform settings. (b) The absence of empirical or simulation-based validation makes it difficult for readers to assess the practical usability and robustness of the proposed algorithm on real data.

### Summary
This paper considers the contextual pricing problem with binary purchase feedback, where a buyer’s valuation is modeled as a linear function of the context plus an arbitrary noise term whose CDF is $\beta$-Hölder continuous. Depending on the smoothness parameter $\beta$ of the CDF, this semi-parametric contextual pricing problem exhibits varying levels of difficulty, resulting in different regret exponents as functions of $\beta$.

With an improved confidence bound analysis, the authors present a universal algorithm for semi-parametric contextual pricing with general $\beta$, achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$, which constitutes a uniform improvement over prior universal algorithms (previously $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{2\beta+1}{4\beta-1}})$ by Fan et. al.) and matches the optimal rates for specific cases such as $\beta = 1, 2$.

### Strengths
- Their upper bound is a uniform (i.e., over all $\beta$) improvement over the previous universal bound by Fan et al. (2024) (although there is a difference in assumptions between this work and Fan et al.). In particular, the new bound matches the optimal rates for $\beta = 1, 2$, where the previous bound had a gap.

- The technical contribution through an improved confidence bound analysis is solid. While the framework builds upon the analysis of Wang & Chen, the extension of the analysis to general $\beta$, especially $\beta \ge 2$, is non-trivial due to intricate dependency issues overlooked in Wang & Chen. The authors resolve this by directly using the analytical form of the local polynomial regression estimator and the Hanson–Wright inequality.

### Weaknesses
- While the bound matches the optimal rate in specific cases, there is no uniform (over all $\beta$) lower bound for this setting. Although a non-contextual lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$ exists and matches the claimed rate of this paper, that result does not rely on a strong unimodality assumption.

- The regret bound’s dependence on the feature dimension $d$ is quite large, $\mathrm{poly}(d^\beta, \log T)$ (Theorem 13), leading to exponential dependence on $\beta$. It is not clear how this dependency compares with previous works on semi-parametric contextual pricing. Moreover, the origin of this term is not well explained in either the main text or the proof of Theorem 13. The proof suggests that it stems from the burn-in time, but it is unclear where this burn-in time is formally established. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss the origin of this term and potential ways to mitigate this dependency.

- It would also be useful to provide numerical simulations supporting that this dependence is likely an artifact of the analysis rather than a fundamental limitation of the algorithm design.

### Questions
As mentioned in the weaknesses: where exactly does the $\mathrm{poly}(d^\beta, \log T)$ term come from? If it originates from the burn-in time, where is that proved? Or is it considered a standard knowledge in this line of work?

### Summary
This paper studies a contextual dynamic pricing problem, where the demand function is semiparametric (as single-index model) and Holder smooth. The key demand assumptions are: (1) strong uni-modality (2) positive definite covariate matrix (3) monotonicity of the link fucntion $g(\cdot)$. This paper claims the algorithm enjoys an optimal regret rate for general smoothness level $\beta$, which directly generalizes previous result of Wang and Chen (2025) with $\beta=2$.

I am generally positive about this paper in terms of the problem setup and claim contributions, but did not check the key technical proofs line by line, and therefore have limited assessment on the correctness, e.g., specific critique of prior proofs (Appendix K).

### Strengths
- The studied contextual pricing model is fundamental and the regret bound result is strong.
- The authors clearly articulates the difference compared to the prior work Wang and Chen (2025). Therefore, if correct, the result provides a solid contribution and fills the gap.
- The writing is good overall with clear explanation on the algorithm design and proof ideas.

### Weaknesses
- The numerical feasibility of the proposed algorithm is not very clear and no numerical study is shown. 
   - The LPSP algorithm (Algorithm 2) relies on key smoothness parameter.
   - In particular, Algorithm 1 produces an estimate $\hat{g}(\cdot | \theta)$ for $\theta$ lying in a continuous range. How is this facilitated in computation? Note that Algorithm 1 is called routinely in Algorithm 2.
- The strong uni-modality assumption is still relatively strong, even if given the fact that several prior works also invoked it.

### Questions
- The algorithm relies on the knowledge of $\beta$. There is recently work on achieving smoothness-adaptive dynamic pricing in the non-contextual and linear-contextual case [1][2]. Can their approaches be potentially adopted here?
- Can the authors comment more on the regret dependence on the context dimension $d$? Currently the dependence is $d^4$. One would expect the performances might deteriorate quickly as $d$ increases.
- I understand that this work is mainly of theoretical nature. However, more detailed discussion on the numerical implementation or even including numerical simulations would strengthen the work.
