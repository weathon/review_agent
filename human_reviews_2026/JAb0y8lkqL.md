## Abstract
Molecular representations (MRs) that capture 3D conformations are critical for applications such as reaction prediction, drug design, and material discovery. Yet despite the rapid development of molecular representation models, there is no comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their treatment of 3D conformational information.
We introduce 3DCS, the first benchmark for 3D Conformational Sensitivity in MRs. 3DCS evaluates whether representations within the same molecule (i) preserve geometric variation, (ii) capture chirality, and (iii) reflect the energy landscape. To enable this, we curate three large-scale datasets ($>$1M molecules, $\sim$10M conformers) spanning relaxed torsional scans, chiral drug candidates, and AIMD trajectories, and propose a unified Geometry–Chirality–Energy (GCE) evaluation framework.
Empirical analysis reveals that while modern data-driven MRs are highly geometry-sensitive, they inconsistently handle chirality and poorly align with energy, which is often overlooked. 3DCS thus provides the first rigorous benchmark for developing physically grounded, functionally reliable 3D molecular representations.

### Summary
This paper introduces three datasets designed to benchmark molecular representations in their ability to capture 3D structural information. The datasets encompass molecular geometries, chirality-related features, and energy values. The authors evaluate molecular representations by computing pairwise distances between molecules in representation space and correlating these distances with structural, chiral, and energetic differences. A suite of metrics is employed to assess whether the representations sufficiently encode essential 3D information.

### Strengths
Overall, the paper addresses an important and timely challenge in molecular machine learning: evaluating the 3D-awareness of molecular representations. The proposed datasets and evaluation framework are novel and potentially impactful.

### Weaknesses
## Dataset Quality and Methodology
1. Why was xTB chosen for generating molecular geometries? Does this level of theory provide sufficient accuracy for benchmarking purposes?
2. How does the quality of the xTB-derived geometries and energies compare to those in OMol25, which uses more accurate quantum chemical methods?
## Chirality Dataset Design
1. What is the rationale for introducing torsional perturbations in the chirality dataset? Could these perturbations inadvertently alter stereocenters, thereby confounding the intended chirality assessment?
## Correlation Metrics and Interpretability
1. While representation distances should ideally correlate with geometric, chiral, and energetic differences, such relationships are likely to be nonlinear or non-monotonic. What would constitute an ideal alignment between representation space and these physical properties?
Are the selected correlation metrics sufficient to capture these potentially complex relationships? A justification or discussion of metric suitability would strengthen the work.
## Benchmark Relevance to Downstream Tasks
1. Do the proposed benchmarks correlate with performance on real-world molecular property prediction tasks? It would be more compelling if representations that perform well on these 3D benchmarks also demonstrate superior performance on established benchmarks for practical property prediction.

### Questions
1. Please clarify the units used for energy and RMSD throughout the benchmarks.

### Summary
This work contributes a benchmark for assessing the capabilities of molecular representations to discern 3D conformers (of the same underlying molecule) in terms of geometric, stereochemistry (specifically chirality), and energy sensitivity (i.e., variability). The benchmark, called 3DCs, consists of three datasets: (1) a geometry dataset obtained by dihedral scan around the inter-ring single bond in small angular increments,  (2) a chirality dataset filtered from ChemBL based on annotation stereocenters, and (3) an energy dataset based on MD17. The authors advocate a two-layer framework: (a) reference alignment between pairs of conformers that takes into account the discrepancy in atomic positions after alignment, fraction of mismatched stereocenters, and difference in potential energy; and (b) manifold consistency between local neighbourhoods. Five baselines, namely, E3FP (classical, non-neural 3D fingerprints), UniMol, MolAE, GemNet, and MolSpectra that encode 3D information are evaluated.  Empirical results demonstrate that molecular representations can reflect the geometric variations rather well but struggle with chirality and energy.

### Strengths
--- The motivation for this paper is clear and important: having good datasets and evaluation strategies for benchmarking the quality of molecular representations is important to advance fields such as drug discovery. 

--- Geometry, chirality, and energy are all known to be important factors in the drug design pipelines due to their impact on binding, safety, and stability respectively (and efficacy as a whole).

--- The dataset on chirality seems particularly relevant. I'm not aware of other datasets for quantifying chirality in a meaningful way.

### Weaknesses
--- One of the reasons that hinders the ability of molecular representations to reflect chirality properly is due to equivariance [1]. Specifically, E(3)-equivariant models provably struggle with chirality, while learning chirality-aware features under SE(3)-invariance has high complexity in terms of the number of atoms (O(N^4)).  The current experimental setup already includes the UniMol baseline which implements an SE(3)-equivariant transformer. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the benchmark indeed shows improved performance with a field-based model [1] that is designed to handle chirality better than the equivariant representations. 

---The authors claim in the discussion section that “Neural architecture such as SE(3)-equivariant transformers and message-passing networks (MPNNs) capture long-range dependencies and global structure.” I understand why this should hold for SE(3)-equivariant transformers, but do not see how MPNNs capture long-range dependencies and global structure. This is very counterintuitive and goes against conventional wisdom, since MPNNs have a strong inbuilt locality bias and are known to struggle with global properties such as the number of substructures (e.g., cycles) etc.

--- It’s not clear whether/to what extent the estimated energy values pertaining to the geometry dataset obtained with relaxed scan are consistent with the ground truth in the absence of wetlab validation (in contrast to MD simulations, where DFT is employed for reasonably accurate estimates). 

--- The methods used for evaluation are not quite state of the art. For example, none of the best-performing methods for predicting energy and force of conformations in the molecular dynamics experiment (such as NequIP, TopNets, MACE) are included.  

--- All three aspects (geometry, chirality, and energy) seem to have been evaluated in unconditional settings (i.e., absent protein targets). In practice, one really cares about target-specific sensitivity of molecular conformations. 

--- There seems to be a discrepancy in terms of the stated number of conformers at different parts of the paper. Specifically, in the introduction the authors mention that "We curate three datasets that contain over 1M molecules and 110M conformers: (i) a relaxed scan dataset with∼1.5M molecules and almost 100 million conformers obtained by rotating an inter-ring bond and relaxing the rest
of the structure;". In contrast, in the corresponding section 3, the claim is "After processing, the dataset comprises 10,097,643 conformers, each annotated with its corresponding dihedral and energy values.

### Questions
--- Could you please include results with strong baselines for (1) chirality,  (2) energy/force, and (3) conditional settings that I mentioned in the weaknesses section? I would be willing to revisit my score if this requested empirical evidence is consistent with the claims of the paper. 

--- Could you please address my concerns about potential energy mismatch under relaxed scan and that particular claim about ability of MPNNs to capture long-range dependencies and global structure?

--- How many conformers does your relaxed scan dataset contain - 100 million or 10 million?

### Summary
The paper provides a dataset and benchmark for characterizing how molecular representations capture intra-molecular conformational sensitivity. The evaluation framework spans 3 areas of interest: geometry, chirality, and energy, each with their own large-scale datasets that measure how well molecular representations correlate with geometric changes, whether they distinguish stereoisomers, and how well they correlate to the underlying conformational energy landscape.  The empirical results show that while modern data-driven molecular representations are sensitive to geometry, they fail to capture chirality, and don't align with energy variation.

### Strengths
This is a useful collection of large datasets with a clear analysis process. The methodology is described in a clear fashion and the molecule dataset selection (including processing and augmentation) make sense. The benchmarks across a range of methods highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different types of approaches. The observed lack of proper handling of chirality by all methods aligns well with anecdotal observations and community experience, and the introduction of a specialized dataset for the characterization of this property is timely and important.

### Weaknesses
The current version of the paper lacks the associated dataset and codes, which are critical for reproducibility and use of this new dataset and benchmark.  The emphasis on correlation metrics may not fully capture non-linear relationships between the conformation of the molecule and the molecular representation space, potentially reducing the importance of complex but otherwise valid methods. Furthermore, the present work does not yet demonstrate any relationship between performance of this benchmark and downstream performance on practical tasks, say docking pose prediction, so the main use might would focus on characterizing rather than ranking, new molecular representations.

### Questions
The paper is generally clear.  One question is whether the proposed benchmark could eventually serve not only as a characterization tool, but as a metric to help design better molecular representations, for example by suggesting weaknesses that could be overcome by training or modifications of hyperparameters. Although this is beyond the scope of the current work, I would be curious to know if the authors envisioned such a use.

Have the authors thought about ways to link the performance in these benchmarks to the performance in downstream tasks?  For instance, once enough representations have been evaluated, a simple empirical cross correlation between these new metrics and downstream task performance (docking or property prediction) would provide additional insights and help increase the practical relevance of this new characterization.

### Summary
This paper presents 3DCS, a benchmark framework for evaluating 3D conformational sensitivity in molecular representations. It introduces three datasets (relaxed torsional scans, chiral drug candidates, and AIMD trajectories) and a unified GCE (Geometry–Chirality–Energy) evaluation framework. The benchmark assesses both handcrafted and learned molecular representations (E3FP, UniMol, MolAE, GemNet, MolSpectra) in a **zero-shot** setting, revealing that most models capture geometry well but struggle with chirality and energy alignment.

### Strengths
The problem studied is meaningful: how well molecular representation models handle 3D conformational variations, rather than just particular molecular properties.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of model training or adaptation on 3DCS. All models are evaluated in a _zero-shot_ setting using their pre-trained representations. Therefore, the poor chirality and energy performance might not reflect fundamental architectural deficiencies but rather distribution mismatch between 3DCS and their pre-training datasets (e.g., PCQM4Mv2). It would strengthen the claims to:
    - Split 3DCS into train/validation/test sets and retrain existing models on 3DCS to verify whether their performance improves under the proposed GCE metrics.
    - Further examine whether training on 3DCS enhances downstream molecular property prediction tasks (e.g., QM9, MD17).
2. Potential limitation in the geometry sensitivity assumption. The evaluation of geometry sensitivity relies on the assumption that _if two conformers have large atomic coordinate differences (high RMSD), their representation distance should also be large_. This assumption may not always hold physically: Two conformers with large RMSD can have very similar energies or functions. Conversely, small geometric differences can correspond to substantial energetic or functional changes. Thus, the current geometric metrics (Spearman/Kendall correlations with RMSD) may overemphasize purely geometric deviations without distinguishing physically meaningful conformational changes.

Please refer to my proposed weaknesses.
