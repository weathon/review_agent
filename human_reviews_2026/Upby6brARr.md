## Abstract
In this paper, we consider the constrained $k$-center problems.  Existing algorithms for these problems often rely on optimal radius guessing strategy, leading to an overall running time that is dependent on the aspect ratio $\Delta$ (the ratio between the maximum and minimum pairwise distances). This dependency may potentially limit the scalability of the algorithms for handling large-scale datasets. To overcome the aspect ratio dependency issue, we propose a multi-scaling method.  Multi-scaling partitions the clustering instance based on relative distances between data points. It then generates a set of candidate radii whose size is independent of $\Delta$, ensuring the existence of at least one radius that can closely approximate the optimal one for any constrained $k$-center instance. This narrows the search space for radius guessing  and removes the running time dependency on the aspect ratio. To further improve the efficiency of multi-scaling, we introduce a problem-specific data reduction method that allows multi-scaling to operate on a smaller unweighted instance while preserving theoretical guarantees. These techniques enable us to obtain approximation results for a series of constrained $k$-center problems with near-linear running time in the data size. Empirical experiments show that our proposed methods achieve better performances compared with the SOTA algorithms on both small and large-scale clustering datasets.

### Summary
Many algorithms for constrained $k$-center problems (such as those with outliers, fairness constraints, etc.) rely on the assumption that a near-optimal radius can be efficiently approximated. Typically, this step incurs a dependence on $\Delta$, the distance aspect ratio of the input. The paper proposes a preprocessing subroutine that eliminates this dependence by producing a list guaranteed to contain a near-optimal radius.
In Euclidean spaces, the proposed subroutine constructs a list of size $O(n \log (nd))$, which, when combined with a standard binary search, results in only $O(\log (n \log d))$ iterations of the downstream algorithms. The preprocessing itself runs in $O(nd \log^2 n)$ time (ignoring $\epsilon$-dependent factors). Consequently, the approach removes the $\Delta$-dependence from the running time of many existing algorithms.

The core idea is based on constructing a Hierarchically Separated Tree (HST) over the input points. For Euclidean settings, such trees can be built in $O(nd \log^2 n)$ time [Har-Peled, 2011], independently of $\Delta$. Once the HST is obtained, the authors introduce a bottom-up bucketing strategy that groups distances associated with each tree node. The key observation is that the distance between points represented by the children of a node is bounded in the HST, allowing both the bucket sizes and the number of buckets to remain independent of $\Delta$.

Additionally, the paper presents specific preprocessing schemes for certain problem settings, achieving faster running times for corresponding algorithms. Finally, the authors conduct an extensive set of experiments demonstrating the empirical speedups achieved by incorporating the proposed subroutine compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a single, unified framework that applies to a variety of constrained $k$-center problems in a consistent manner.

2. A comprehensive set of experiments is presented, clearly demonstrating the benefits and efficiency gains of using the proposed preprocessing framework.

### Weaknesses
1. I find it difficult to understand the practical motivation for designing such a preprocessing subroutine. From a theoretical perspective (real RAM model), the motivation is clear: $\Delta$ can be arbitrarily large, making such a subroutine useful. However, the paper’s motivation seems to be based on practical datasets. In such cases, the aspect ratio is typically bounded in terms of $n$, since the input precision is inherently limited. For example, assuming $n$ points with each coordinate represented using $O(n)$ bits is a reasonable practical assumption. In this case, $\Delta = 2^{O(n)}$, which leads to a multiplicative overhead (as mentioned in the paper) of $O(\log \log (n\Delta)) = O(\log n + \log \log n)$—comparable to the overhead obtained using the proposed methodology.

2. The techniques used are quite standard: constructing HSTs and applying bucketing. Similarly, the data reduction approach for $k$-center with outliers follows the classic Gonzalez algorithm.

3. The results appear to primarily target Euclidean spaces. Although the authors provide a short extension to general metrics in the appendix, the final theorem statement is not presented, leaving the precise bounds unclear. Moreover, for general metrics, the input already has $n^2$ distance entries, so sorting and applying binary search is already near-linear time, reducing the apparent benefit of the proposed approach.

### Questions
1. The data reduction technique used for $k$-center with outliers seems fairly standard. Could you highlight the challenges and techniques used for data reduction in the other problem variants?

2. Can you state the exact theorem for general metrics? (See Weakness #3.)

3. Could you provide a reference for the existing multiplicative overhead of $O(\log \log (n \Delta))$ mentioned on line 75? This seems surprisingly efficient. Does this result hold in general metrics as well?

4. Figures and Table are difficult to read; the font size is too small to interpret properly.

5. In Table 1, for the $k$-center with outliers row, why is the bicriteria algorithm denoted as $(A'(r_1), A'(r_2))$? Shouldn’t it be $(A'(r), A'(z))$, since the bicriteria refers to the approximation for $r$ and $z$?

### Summary
Optimal radius guessing is a widely used technique for solving the $k$-center clustering problem and its variants. This paper proposes a new optimal radius guessing algorithm—a multi-scaling method—along with problem-dependent acceleration strategies.
This method recursively constructs a hierarchical separation tree to generate a set of candidate radii. The authors prove that this set is guaranteed to contain at least one radius that approximates the optimal value. This candidate set can then be integrated with existing radius-guessing-based algorithms to solve specific $k$-center problems.

The list-generating algorithm returns a set of size $O(n\log n d)$ in $O(nd\log^2(n)/\lambda^2)$ time. To further accelerate this process. The authors first compute a data summary and then generate the radii based on this summary. This strategy reduces the overall time complexity.

This work has two main contributions: 

- the size of candidate radii set is independent of the aspect ration $\Delta$. Consequently, the running time of the k-clustering problem also becomes independent of $\Delta$.
- The concept of summaries is introduced to accelerate the radius guessing process.

### Strengths
- it is the first to remove the dependence on the aspect ratio $\Delta$ for the optimal radius guessing.

### Weaknesses
- The current comparison lacks clarity. Notations (e.g. $\mathcal{A}$) depends on the specific radius-guessing based algorithms selected, making it difficult to determine whether the presented framework truly induces a better algorithm for specific constrained k-center clustering variants.
- For the Individual Fair k-center and (α,β)-Fair k-center, the results are not competitive with those of existing methods.

### Questions
- The time complexity of existing radius guessing methods typically includes a factor of  $\log\log(\Delta)$. Could this be really large in practice or just theoretically important?
- The proposed data summary concept appears to have independent research value, particularly as it seems to differ significantly from the well-studied coreset concept. Can this summary be combined with other radius guessing algorithms, and what would be the resulting approximation guarantees and time complexities?

### Summary
This submission introduces a technique to make the radius guessing step for constrained k-center problems (e.g. k-center with outliers, individually fair k-center) independent of the aspect ratio $\Delta$, which is defined by the ratio between the largest and the smallest pairwise distance between two points.

The proposed multi-scaling method consists of two steps: First all data points get sorted into a hierarchical tree structure, where each point is represented by a leaf and any inner vertex of the tree represents a subset of points which is associated with an upper bound for the diameter. Then the tree is traversed in a bottom-up fashion and the points are partitioned into groups of well-separated clusters. The inter cluster radii of this partition are then used to build a candidate set of possible cluster radii of size $O(n log(nd)\lambda^2)$ in sub-quadratic running time that is independent of $\Delta$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\lambda$ is a parameter that decides the separation of the partition. It is proven that this radius guessing technique only loses an $\epsilon$ in the approximation guarantee for the underlying clustering problems. Later also problem-specific data reduction algorithms are proposed, which further improve upon the running time for the k-center problem with outliers.

The authors conclude the paper with experiments on multiple data sets, which show a runtime improvement in comparison with existing methods for the specific problems and instances, while getting slightly worse costs/fairness.

### Strengths
The technical contribution is quite involved and novel. The algorithm performs reasonably well in experiments.

### Weaknesses
The writing is quite condensed and particularly the partitioning step of the algorithm is quite confusing and hard to understand due to the large amount of parameters. It would be helpful to discuss the meaning of the parameters in more detail.

The proposed method is only interesting for data sets with very high aspect ratio. In the experiments the speed up in comparison to existing methods is only a small constant factor (often smaller than 2).

### Questions
Could you give an intuition why the high distortion $O(nd)$ of the HST is not a problem for the approximation factor?

The text within Figure 1 and Table 1 is too small to be readable.

In Table 6 the highlighted running times are often not the best.

### Summary
The paper studies constrained $k$-center in Euclidean space and eliminates runtime dependence on the aspect ratio $\Delta$. It introduces a multi-scaling preprocessing step that builds a hierarchically well-separated tree (HST) and performs a bottom-up tree mapping to produce a small set of candidate radii. By combining the obtained clustering radii into any radius-guessing routine, the proposed methods can yield nearly the same approximation (or bi-criteria) guarantees without $\Delta$ dependency on the runtime complexities. To further accelerate the multi-scaling process, a problem-specific data-reduction scheme is proposed, where near-linear time results can be achieved with similar guarantees by executing multi-scaling on a compact unweighted “coreset”. Experiments on $k$-center with outliers and fair $k$-center variants show consistent speedups over existing algorithms with essentially comparable cost. In general, this is a good paper with neat and sound techniques.

### Strengths
1.  The paper eliminates runtime dependence on the aspect ratio by replacing radius guessing with a multi-scaling process while preserving existing approximation guarantees. The proposed methods can be used to solve a series of constrained $k$-center problems. In my opinion, it  is a timely and practically important task to remove ∆ from the runtime for constrained k-center.

2.  The complexity, HST construction in O(d n log^2 n) and a candidate set of O(n log (nd)/\lambda^2), looks reasonable in high-dimensional regimes where ∆ can be huge.

3. Running on SIFT (100M points) and other large sets is compelling, and the 1.5–1.8× speedups over a strong greedy baseline is impressive.

### Weaknesses
1. Overhead remains $O(\log(n logd))$ even after multi-scaling, and it is unclear when data reduction should be used to beat strong $\Delta$-dependent approaches.

2. Although removing the aspect ratio dependency makes good contributions to theoretical analysis, the runtime improvements appear modest in several experimental settings.

3. For most constrained k-center problems the optimal radius is attained at a pairwise distance among the n input points. Hence one can sort the O(n^2) candidate pairwise distances and binary-search them with a feasibility oracle to obtain an approximate solution. Would you give more details about comparing your method with this standard binary-search approach?

4. Although this paper is well-written, there are still a few typos. The authors should fixed them in the future version (minor comments):

a) “Removing Aspect-Ratio Dependence *on* the Running Time” should be *in*

b) Line 34, page 1, "Among various mathematical *formulation*, " should be * formulations*

c) “even in a plane” → “even in the plane”

d) “To our best knowledge” → “To the best of our knowledge”

e) “where points in each Xi share a same color” → “where points in each Xi  share the same color”

f) Standardize “running time” vs “runtime” (pick one).

g) Replace “Due to space limit(s)” with “Due to space limitations” and move longer proofs to an appendix while keeping a proof sketch in the main text.

### Questions
1. In general, the paper primarily targets $k$-center. A direct question is: can the multi-scaling framework extend to $k$-median and $k$-means, and what modifications (if any) are needed so that comparable approximation and runtime guarantees can be achieved?

2. Besides the centralized Euclidean setting, can the multi-scaling and summary-based pipelines be extended to distributed or streaming settings and to other related problems?

3. See the weakness section.

### Summary
This paper addresses constrained k-center problems and identifies a key limitation in existing algorithms: their running time depends on the dataset's aspect ratio (Δ), which hinders scalability. To overcome this, the authors propose a multi-scaling method that partitions data based on relative distances and generates a compact set of candidate radii independent of Δ. This eliminates the need for exhaustive radius guessing.

### Strengths
The proposed multi-scaling method completely removes the runtime dependency on the aspect ratio (Δ), a significant bottleneck in prior work. This enhances the algorithm's scalability and makes it more suitable for large-scale datasets.

By combining multi-scaling with a novel data reduction technique, the method achieves near-linear runtime in data size while preserving approximation guarantees. This offers an excellent balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, as validated by empirical results.

### Weaknesses
While the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm generally achieves shorter running times and demonstrates competitive clustering loss, these advantages are not pronounced. This is particularly evident when compared to the Greedy algorithm, which was proposed six years ago. Consequently, I think the significance and novelty of this paper are marginal.
