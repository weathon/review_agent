# Layer-Wise Universal Approximation and Progressive Optimization for Residual Networks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 4, 6

## Abstract
This paper provides a theoretical analysis to bridge the gap wherein the classical UAT, originally developed for feedforward networks (FNNs), fails to directly apply to modern residual networks (RNs) like ResNets and Transformers. Our key contributions are: First, we prove a layer-wise UAT for residual networks by formulating ResNet and Transformer blocks in a unified form compatible with FNNs,
ensuring that each layer satisfies the UAT conditions (compact inputs and continuity). Second, using this layer-wise formulation, we demonstrate that RN training can be effectively modeled as a compensatory additive model, enabling sequential optimization where layers collaboratively reduce input-output divergence. Unlike conventional end-to-end training (which suffers from instability risks), our layer-wise approach ensures bounded learning and superior convergence. Third, we propose Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA), a training paradigm that operationalizes sequential optimization while increasing the probability of achieving UAT-compliant approximations at each layer. Experimental results across both synthetic datasets and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate LPA’s significant advantages: up to 8.31% higher accuracy alongside early-layer convergence and improved training stability compared to conventional end-to-end approaches. We further show that adding an adaptive criterion to LPA
automatically discovers the effective layers and prunes the remainder, enabling aggressive compression, reducing model size by up to 79.17%. This suggests that simply scaling up the model is often unnecessary. The source code will be released

### Summary
This paper extends the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), originally developed for feedforward networks, to ResNets and Transformers. The authors make three main contributions:

1. Demonstrate that layer-wise UAT can be applied to ResNets and Transformers by reformulating their block operations into matrix–vector form.

2. Propose a collaborative end-to-end and sequential training approach that leverages this theoretical connection.

3. Introduce Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA), a layer-wise training method that reportedly outperforms standard end-to-end methods on synthetic datasets, CIFAR-10/100, and Fashion-MNIST.

### Strengths
- The related works are appropriately cited.

- The Universal Approximation Theorem is explicitly stated, providing readers with the necessary theoretical background.

- Figures 2 and 3 provide visually clear and straightforward comparisons that help illustrate the experimental results.

### Weaknesses
**Motivation and conceptual clarity**: The motivation is weak and conceptually confusing. The paper conflates approximation (a representational property) with optimization (a training procedure), which are distinct things. The logic connecting UAT to the proposed method, especially in the last paragraph of Section 3, is unclear and unconvincing.

**Technical soundness**: Due to the above conceptual issues, the technical grounding of the paper is questionable, making it more like a heuristic tweak. The proposed LPA algorithm essentially performs layer-wise training (Algorithm 1) given that $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function. This has nothing to with UAT, which concerns function approximation that does not involve training.

**Presentation issues**: Figure 1 is difficult to interpret due to vague captions, and insufficient legends and labels. Experimental details on synthetic datasets are also missing.

**Limited validation**: The evaluation is restricted to small-scale datasets (CIFAR, Fashion-MNIST), without experiments on larger or more diverse tasks (e.g., ImageNet), making the practical significance unclear.

### Questions
1. The “gap” between prior UAT studies and the proposed approach is not clearly defined and well-motivated. The authors claim that prior works are architecture-specific (line 90). Does this mean those results were derived for modified versions of ResNet/Transformer architectures, while the authors target the vanilla versions? If so, what exactly differs, and why can’t prior results generalize?

2. What new insights are gained by stating that UAT is “feasible to RNs” at the layer level? How does this provide practical or theoretical value for understanding residual networks?

3. The terms “compensatory additive problem” and “oscillation risks” are undefined and unclear throughout the paper. Please provide formal definitions or intuitive explanations.

4. Section 3’s analysis appears trivial: it essentially restates that a multilayer fully connected network with residual connections is a universal approximator. The derivation in Eq. (15) does not seem to introduce new theoretical insight. Could the authors clarify what is genuinely novel here?

5. How does the layer-wise approximation analysis in Section 3 translate into the layer-wise training procedure in Section 4? These are conceptually different topics (representation vs. optimization).

6. The theoretical results primarily rely on fully connected networks with sigmoid activations. How do they extend to modern ResNets or Transformers with non-sigmoid activations and more complicated structures? The appendix (B.2) provides only textual justifications without explicit mathematical conversion from CNNs to FCNs. If it cannot, isn't the whole approach still architecture-specific, just falling into the limitations the authors pointed out in previous works? As such, the theoretical part does not fill the claimed gaps at all. 

7. What is the computational cost or time complexity of the proposed training procedure? Since each layer requires retraining previous ones, it appears computationally heavy.

8. Prior work (e.g., Greedy Layerwise Learning Can Scale to ImageNet, ICML 2019) already demonstrated over 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with layer-wise training, which I believe is the sequential training in this paper. Why does your sequential optimization yield significantly lower accuracy?

### Summary
The paper extends the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to modern residual architectures such as ResNets and Transformers. It formulates a layer-wise UAT showing that each residual block satisfies UAT conditions on compact domains, and introduces Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA), a hybrid between sequential and end-to-end training that enforces progressive layer convergence. Theoretical insights are supported by experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100, Fashion-MNIST), where LPA improves accuracy and stability, and an adaptive version enables large compression without accuracy loss.

### Strengths
1. The proposed Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA) is intuitively appealing. It aligns with layer-wise pretraining ideas. 

2. The paper offers an elegant reformulation of residual layers in a mathematically consistent way, connecting residual mappings to FNN form. This provides a novel, unifying theoretical link between classical approximation theory and modern architectures.

3. The adaptive layer-stopping rule offers a neat way to discover effective depth, leading to large parameter reductions without losing accuracy.

### Weaknesses
1. As described in Algorithm 1, a single training epoch appears to involve two full passes over the dataset. The first pass (lines 3-10) is itself computationally intensive, performing L nested backward passes for an L-layer network, resulting in roughly $O(L^2)$ computational complexity per batch. The paper provides no analysis of this overhead (e.g. training time vs. baseline). This makes it impossible to judge the practical efficiency of LPA.

2. LPA is not compared with methods such as Greedy Layer-wise Training [1], Deeply-Supervised Nets [2], and Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling [3]. Without this, it’s unclear if LPA’s gains stem from its theoretical design or from known stabilization effects of progressive optimization.

3. While the results on CIFAR and Fashion-MNIST are strong, these are relatively small-scale datasets. The paper's claims about improved stability and convergence would be far more convincing if demonstrated on a large-scale benchmark such as ImageNet. 

4. The writing can be improved. It is verbose and contains several typographical and grammatical errors (e.g., “Universial” instead of Universal, “Archtitectures” instead of Architectures, “Simutaneous” instead of Simultaneous, “patten” instead of pattern).

### Summary
The paper extends the universal approximation theorem (UAT) to residual networks and thus other architectures such as convolutional networks Transformer architectures. The extension is done by recognizing that each residual block itself is a one-hidden-layer network and thus we can apply UAT in a suitable fashion to show the universal approximation. Using this concept, a layer-wise progressive approximation (LPA) is proposed to train a residual network layer by layer. Two groups of experiments are conducted. One for verifying the approximation ability on synthetic datasets and the other one for real image recognition datasets. On the approximation side, LPA shows order of magnitude improvements over end-to-end training and sequential optimization. On the image recognition side, LPA shows better performance than the other two baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written with good clarity. Exploring different options for training is a very important research avenue and this paper compares three different training techniques on both approximation and generalization tasks, which is interesting and insightful.

### Weaknesses
It is trivial that a residual network can satisfy universal approximation and thus for other works due to the use of MLP or an equivalent form. I believe LPA has good approximation. However, I am not convinced that LPA has better generalization than end-to-end training due to the limited experiments. The CIFAR-10/100 and Fashion-MNIST are very small datasets. On the other hand, like proving UAT, it is also important to prove some generalization bounds for LPA if possible. If not, what is the main difficulty? From an optimization viewpoint, a reader would expect some guarantees or results on the quality of the solution or the optimization landscape. For example, can we show that by LPA, the network always outperforms certain strong predictors? Some related works are also missing in this aspect. There are some nice properties for the optimization landscape of a residual network. See the following references for instance.

### Questions
1.	In all the experiments, did we apply any learning rate scheduling to make sure different training strategies get their best learning rate schedule?
2.	The datasets used are very small. Have you tried ImageNet or some real datasets other than image recognition?
3.	In the ResNet architecture, there is a nonlinearity before the last linear layer. Eq. (10) does not include that. Is this a simplified ResNet?
4.	Do we use batch normalization in the experiments?
5.	How to theoretically study the generalization ability of LPA? Is it possible to derive some generalization bounds for it?

### Summary
The paper revisits the universal approximation theorem (UAT) from a layer-wise perspective, showing that residual and Transformer architectures can, in principle, achieve universal approximation through a recursive composition of continuous mappings. It further proposes a practical Layer-wise Progressive Approximation (LPA) algorithm inspired by this theoretical view. Overall, the theoretical framing is interesting and the exposition is clear.

### Strengths
1. The paper is readable, with equations and intuition laid out clearly.
2. The idea of connecting layer-wise residual updates with UAT is elegant and pedagogically valuable.
3. The paper provides a new viewpoint for understanding how deep residual structures build representations progressively.
4. Experiments, though small-scale, are well-organized and confirm the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper needs to be polished. Several typos exist, and there are notations that could be made clearer. 
2. I am not sure how strong the claim that 'prior work struggled to obtain generalizable conclusions because it attempted to model entire multi-layer architectures at once' is, because at least for ResNet, the UAT conclusion from a typical FNN could be easily adapted with minimal additional efforts.
3. Line 155, in the derivation from single-layer RN to two-layer RN, the argument implicitly replaces a target $f_{2}(x_0)$ (a function of $x_0$) to $G_2(x_1)$ (a function of $x_1$.) Even though the authors state that $x_1$ is fixed from $G_1^*$, it holds only when there's an explicit mapping or invertibility assumption between $x_0$ and $x_1$ so that the target function can be reparameterized in the $x_1$-domain. Interestingly, though it has been proved in Appendix G (Factorization Continuity Theorem), the authors do not mention it in the main text. I wonder why?

Just a minor suggestion: maybe the authors can consider compressing the image size in the paper. The current PDF size is 30MB, which is a bit large.
Several typos in the paper:
1. Line 80-90, should be 'various' instead of 'verious';
2. Line 134-135, 'continuous' instead of 'contineous';
3. A FNN/FFN -> An FNN/FFN;
