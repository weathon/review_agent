## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance but at the cost of extreme computational and energy demands, raising the question of how much of their capacity is truly necessary. This paper explores structural and weight redundancies in Transformer-based architectures, aiming to identify inefficiencies and leverage them through targeted compression techniques.
A central focus is assessing whether different modules perform overlapping functions. Although some degree of similarity is observed in the analyzed cases, redundancy proves to be lower than expected, challenging the assumption that weight matrices can be interchanged across layers without compromising performance. Additionally, an analysis of model matrices examines whether they exhibit an inherently low-rank structure.
To further explore these aspects, three novel compression methods are introduced: MASS, which enforces weight aggregation and sharing, along with two factorization-based techniques, GlobaL Fact and ABACO. Experimental results show that while these approaches achieve model compression, their ability to maintain performance is limited, reducing their practical viability.
The findings highlight the complexity of extracting redundancy from Transformer architectures, raising questions about its extent across layers and blocks. By addressing these challenges, this paper aims to contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of LLMs.

### Summary
The paper studies functional redundancy across Transformer blocks and proposes three compression strategies designed to exploit potential sharing: MASS groups same-shape matrices by type and replaces them with a simple average; GlobaL Fact introduces a shared global low-rank factor per group and per-layer local factors; ABACO couples low-rank adapters with an exponentially decaying contribution from the original weights during fine-tuning. The central empirical probe of redundancy swaps modules (primarily FFNNs) between blocks and measures downstream performance. Experiments show that direct sharing or factorization causes substantial accuracy drops and that inter-block redundancy is weaker than expected.

### Strengths
1. The paper takes a principled look at whether different blocks perform overlapping functions and adopts a concrete,  performance-based replacement test to operationalize "functional redundancy." The results verified some results that were in line with the intuitions of model training (such as the importance of the first and last layers of the model). This provides insght for the design of model compression algorithms.
2. The three proposed strategies are straightforward to implement, which lowers the barrier for follow-up work. The paper openly reports when methods collapse and does not overstate claims.

### Weaknesses
1. The analysis method of pairwise substitution one by one in Section 3 has an extremely high computational complexity ($N^2$) and is difficult to continue to be used on larger models. At the same time, the selection of datasets and tasks leads to strong task-specific conclusions (for example, outside the early layers of HellaSwag, attention is not so important), which may not hold true elsewhere.
2. Limited novelty of the proposed methods: MASS directly reduces to uniform averaging within groups of weight matrices without any alignment or importance weighting, so it is unsurprising that capacity is lost. GlobaL Fact is essentially shared low-rank factorization initialized from group SVD, a close cousin of standard truncated-SVD/LoRA-style factorization, with modest adjustments (shared/global vs local). Conceptual distance from known techniques feels small. ABACO is LoRA with an annealed scalar $\alpha$ on the original weights. While neat in practice, the mechanism is incremental rather than a new compression principle. Most importantly, these methods do not truly address the issue identified in Section 3 of the article (redundancy in the model), which is to remove redundancy while ensuring model performance.
3. The author only conducted tests on two benchmarks (HellaSwag and GSM8K) and models (Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B), and the reliability and comprehensiveness of the experimental results were insufficient. No further verification was conducted on models such as Qwen3 and DeepSeeking R1 for tasks like language modeling confusion, instruction compliance, or reasoning evaluation.
4. The paper does not provide a systematic report on the actual speed, memory usage, or throughput/latency changes of the proposed method, which is crucial for the model compression.

### Summary
This paper focuses on model compression for LLMs. Authors argue that the FFNN and attention module have pretty big redundancy and propose to ground the parameters that are close enough and use the average of it to merge into a shared layer using the mean aggregation of different layers. In addition, authors have conducted further experiemnts with local and global factorization as well as adapter-based approximation. Authors have conducted experiments on HellaSwag and GSM8K, where the results on the HellaSwag shows comparable results after finetuning.

### Strengths
+ The overall experiment is comprehensive and show reasonable analysis.

### Weaknesses
- The overall compression is showing serious degradation for the three introduced method for the final performance matrix, and in some case it is showing purely random results. It is not likely to be easily applied on other models for better generalizations and the downstream use case is limited.

- This paper is working as a paper to have negative results, while the exploration of the model and dataset selection is quite limited. As a paper with negative results, it is strongly suggested to have some wider selection of model and dataset, as well as multiple metrics, for further in-depth analysis. 

- Please consider change the presentation in the experiment part, as showing your results of aggregating all your models, and then showing different variations as ablations.

### Summary
In my opinion, this paper was written by an LLM without any review or editing.
The most critical issues are as follows.
1. Significant quality issue (lots of typos in all tables, and extremely small fonts in all figures).
2. Lack of experimental results (only HellaSwag and GSM8K).
3. Significant accuracy degradation after compression (Accuracy 0~0.01 on GSM8k).

Thus, I recommend "Strong Reject".

### Summary
This paper investigates functional redundancy in Transformer-based language models by systematically replacing modules (FFNNs and self-attention) across layers and measuring performance impact on HellaSwag and GSM8K benchmarks. 

The results show that redundancy in Transformer models is lower than previously assumed. When replacing layers, performance typically degrades more than when ablating layers. Based on this finding, the authors propose three compression methods: MASS (Matrix Aggregation and Sharing Strategy), GlobaLFact (Global and Local Factorization), and ABACO (Adapter-Based Approximation and Compression Optimization).

Experimental results on Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2 show that all three methods have limited success, with significant performance degradation even after fine-tuning. The authors conclude that Transformers exhibit less exploitable redundancy than expected.

### Strengths
The author addresses an important and timely issue of LLM efficiency and compression. They provide transparent reporting of negative results, which is valuable for the research community. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach and avoid overstating their results.

### Weaknesses
Limited novel contribution -- main finding is negative results without sufficient insights into why redundancy is hard to exploit. Experimental scope is limited: only 2 models, 2 benchmarks, no statistical significance testing or multiple runs. 
Replacement analysis methodology is relatively crude – swapping entire modules doesn't capture nuanced forms of redundancy or partial similarity. 

Missing comparisons with compression baselines (especially pruning and factorization methods). 
The paper doesn't explore more sophisticated grouping criteria or aggregation strategies despite acknowledging their limitations.
Authors cite sophisticated activation-aware factorization methods in Related Work but then use naive SVD in their own approach. This makes the comparison unfair and the negative results less meaningful -- of course basic SVD fails when papers like FWSVD, ASVD and SVD-LLM have shown you need activation (or gradient)-aware methods. 

The few cases of successful replacement (positive redundancy) deserve deeper analysis. The title promises exploration of redundancy, but the paper is really about "why (naive) compression methods fail"

### Questions
If the paper is about the level of redundancy being lower than expected, could you please clearly state what the previous belief in the field was?
Why were these datasets chosen? Based on previous research [1][2], there are assumptions about different levels of quality decline for tasks with varying levels of complexity.

Heat maps (Figures 1-4 and 7-18) are challenging to read and understand, as they lack clear visual patterns in dense numerical matrices. Could you please consider reformatting them or using other visualization techniques?
Do you have evidence that such a rough combination of modules into an FFNN module is generally compressible? Because there are articles that explicitly prove the importance of not just individual modules, but individual neurons [3].
Why not compare against modern compression baselines like quantization (GPTQ, AWQ), recent pruning methods beyond SparseGPT, or modern factorization methods?
