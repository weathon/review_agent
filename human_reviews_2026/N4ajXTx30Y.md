## Abstract
The connection between optimal transport (OT) and control theory is well established, most prominently in the Benamou–Brenier dynamic formulation. With quadratic cost, the OT problem can be reframed as a stochastic control problem in which a density $\rho_t$ evolves under a controlled velocity field $v_t$ subject to the continuity equation $\partial_t\rho_t + \nabla\cdot(\rho_tv_t)=0$. In this work, we introduce a velocity prior into the continuity equation and derive a new Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) formulation to learn dynamical probability flows. We further extend the approach to the unbalanced setting by adding a growth term, capturing mass variation processes common in scientific domains such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Importantly, our method requires training only a single neural network to model $v_t$, without the need for a separate model for the growth term $g_t$. Finally, by decomposing the velocity field as $v_\mathrm{total} = v_\mathrm{prior} + v_\mathrm{corr}$, our approach is able to capture complex transport patterns that prior methods struggle to learn due to the curl-free limitation.

### Summary
This paper introduces a method called VP-HJF that incorporates a velocity prior into Hamilton– Jacobi–Bellman flows to reconstruct single-cell trajectories. The approach also extends to unbalanced optimal transport by including a growth term and trains a single neural network to model the corrective velocity. The main claimed contributions are: (i) leveraging a velocity prior to capture complex transport patterns including rotational flows, (ii) introducing a growth term for unbalanced transport, and (iii) reducing learning complexity by only modeling the corrective velocity rather than the full dynamics.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an intuitive idea of incorporating a known or measurable velocity prior into the unbalanced OT / WFR formulation, resulting in the proposed Velocity-Prior Hamilton–Jacobi Flow (VP-HJF). The decomposition is natural and helps separate coarse drift from residual correction, potentially improving the results. 
2. The paper is well written and structured.

### Weaknesses
1.	The main weakness lies in the incremental nature of the contribution. Incorporating a velocity prior to improve trajectory inference is not entirely new; see, for example, (Gu et al., ICLR 2025), which also introduces prior-guided dynamics. Also, a very relevant reference is Curl flow matching (Petrović et al., NeurIPS 2025).  I think the author missed these important references. In addition, using a single network to solve (unbalanced) OT or RUOT (regularized unbalanced optimal transport)-style problems has already been demonstrated in (Neklyudov et al., ICML 2024; Sun et al., NeurIPS 2025), which derives and employs the general HJB formulation. Combining these two ideas naturally leads to the present method, making the contribution incremental in my view.
2. In Figure 2 (upper table), VP-HJF is reported to achieve lower total kinetic energy than OT-FM. However, its higher $W_2$ distance raises the concern that it might not have correctly mapped $\rho_0$ --> $\rho_1$, which could trivially explain the reduced energy. The authors should rule out this possibility. Moreover, the exact form of the velocity prior $v_{\text{prior}}$ used in this experiment is not clearly specified.
3.  For the synthetic Lotka–Volterra dataset, only mass error is reported, with no analysis of velocity accuracy. The ablation compares only a “Prior-only” baseline but not a “Total velocity (without prior)” counterpart. Again, the form of $v_{\text{prior}}$ is unspecified.
4. The paper claims that VP-HJF excels at modeling rotational flows. However, the biological datasets used—Embryoid Body (EB) and bone marrow—primarily reflect developmental and differentiation trajectories, which are largely monotonic rather than rotational. Demonstrating the method on a cell-cycle dataset with pronounced curl-like behavior (e.g., as in Curl-Flow Matching, NeurIPS 2025) would be more convincing.
5. The synthetic ablations show VP-HJF is sensitive to the orientation of $v_{\text{prior}}$. On real scRNA-seq data, the method uses RNA velocity as the prior, but RNA velocity is known to be noisy and sometimes reversed (Bergen et al., Molecular Systems Biology). This raises questions about robustness. In addition, the paper lacks comparisons to other unbalanced OT–based trajectory inference methods, such as uOT-CFM (Eyring et al., ICLR 2024) and DeepRUOT (Zhang et al., ICLR 2025).
6. In Figure 3, the learned growth rate appears to increase with time. Biologically, stem-like progenitor cells at early timepoints typically exhibit higher proliferation rates, so this trend seems inconsistent. This issue echoes the limitations of the WFR formulation discussed in (Sun et al., NeurIPS 2025), which could be discussed by the authors.

### Questions
1. Specify the prior velocity fields. The experiments should clearly describe the functional form or source of each v_{\text{prior}} used—particularly in the Gaussian Translation and Lotka–Volterra experiments. 
2. Validate the correctness of the Balanced Gaussian Translation experiment. Since VP-HJF reports lower kinetic energy but higher W_2 distance than OT-FM, could this indicate imperfect matching of $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$? Please confirm that endpoint constraints are satisfied and that the energy reduction is not an artifact of incomplete transport.
3. Report velocity error in the Lotka–Volterra experiment. Currently, only the mass ratio error is shown. Including velocity RMSE or trajectory error would clarify how accurately the model recovers the dynamic vector field itself.
4. Test on datasets with pronounced rotational dynamics. Since a central claim of the paper is that VP-HJF handles rotational (curl-dominated) flows, please consider evaluating on a biologically relevant cell-cycle dataset or a synthetic curl-flow benchmark similar to Curl-Flow Matching. This would better support the claimed advantage.
5. Discuss robustness to noisy or misaligned priors. The ablations indicate sensitivity to prior direction, and RNA velocity is known to contain substantial noise or reversed directions. Could the authors discuss possible regularization or self-consistency checks to mitigate such issues?
6. Discuss the biological plausibility of the learned growth field. Figure 3 shows high growth at terminal regions, which appears biologically implausible. The authors may wish to discuss this behavior in light of the limitations of the WFR formulation noted by （Sun et al., NeurIPS 2025).

Minor Issues
1. In Equation (6), v should be vcorr to match the decomposition.
2. Lines 305–308: references to Figure 1 middle/right do not match the actual figure panels.
3. Lines 410–411: The claim “This yields more stable gradients and low target variance than enforcing all time points jointly” lacks supporting experiments or citations.
4. Multiple references to “Table 2” in the text actually refer to the tables in Figure 2, which conflicts with the actual Table 2 and causes confusion.

In light of the comments, at the current stage, I lean toward a score of a clear rejection. I believe this work has merit. That said, I am still willing to revise my score if the authors can provide stronger empirical evidence (e.g., the datasets and the baselines), clarify the experimental setups (especially regarding the priors), and further discuss the biological interpretation issues.

### Summary
The authors tackle the problem of learning unbalanced population dynamics of physical systems. They propose a novel method, Velocity Prior-Guided Hamiltonian-Jacobi Flows (VP-HJF), which extends unbalanced action matching to use velocity information as a prior on the drift of the system. As a result, VP-HJF is able to improve modeling of unbalanced population dynamics in certain synthetic settings. The authors present a theoretical backing for the framework and evaluate their approach on a real data setting (modeling cell dynamics using single-cell RNA-seq data).

### Strengths
- In general, the authors present novel and principled method useful for leveraging prior "velocity" knowledge for guiding/learning unbalanced optimal transport dynamics. 
- The work is well motivated with many potential downstream applications for modeling population dynamics in physical systems.

### Weaknesses
I believe this work presents an interesting direction of research and has the potential to provide a useful contribution to the respective community. With that being said, there are several elements that I think need to be addressed to strengthen this work and provide fairer evaluation. Please see below.

- The proposed approach, VP-HJF, seems to require numerical simulation during training to compute the additional density matching loss-term, compared to counterpart methods which are simulation-free during training.
- Empirical experiments could benefit from additional attention, i.e. more datasets/applications/settings. For example, see [2, 4, 5] for some examples of applicable datasets related to the setting(s) considered in this work.  
- Moreover, some baselines which are applied to the same problem settings (especially in the scRNA-seq dataset) are missing. Please see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In addition, unbalanced action matching should also be considered as a baseline for the scRNA-seq experiment. To add, it does not appear the proposed method achieves the best performance on the scRNA-seq dataset, weakening the main claims of this work.
- In regard to what the authors label as a "velocity-based prior" approach, [5] directly addresses what appears to be a very similar problem, but with a simulation-free approach. Granted, they do not consider the unbalanced case, but nonetheless should be considered as a baseline as a velocity-based prior approach. 
- There is no experiment comparing the computational cost and efficiency of VP-HJF with existing baselines and should be included (especially considering the proposed method is not simulation-free during training).
- The paper at times feels unfinished. For example, the conclusion is only 1 sentence, the introduction is missing clear statements of contributions, the references are limited (apart from those I directly mentioned here, there are more related works pertinent to this field which need to be cited), and the appendix seems incomplete: i.e. additional details for experiments, models training and hyper-parameters, training time and compute usage, dataset information, etc ... are missing.

### Questions
- My questions are primarily oriented with the items I listed above under weaknesses, thus, I have no explicit questions at this time.

Minor comments:

- No references to locations for the proofs of Corollary 3.3 and Theorem 3.4.
- Lines 193-194: $\text{Unif}(\mathbb{S}^{d - 1})$ is introduced but not defined.

### Summary
The paper considers unbalanced optimal transport with a velocity prior for scientific applications where such information is often available and may encode divergence-free dynamics such as rotations and curls.   The paper proposes learning both a curl-free control vector field and state-and-time dependent growth factor using a single network, in line with the Hamilton-Jacobi optimality conditions.    The authors propose several optimization tweaks to ostensibly improve training stability and convergence.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a natural extension of matching objectives for flows to incorporate prior guidance available in scientific applications.   While this is natural in the framing of the Schrödinger Bridge problem, the authors consider the `optimal transport with velocity prior' setting , which to my knowledge was proposed in Sec 7 of Chen, Georgiou and Pavon 2014, "On the Relation between optimal transport and Schrodinger bridges", and extend to the unbalanced case.  

The paper proposes several optimization tweaks which improve training stability and convergence compared to directly solving the dual problem as in Neklyudov et. al 2023, 2024.   
- HJB residual squared error loss 
- temperature reweighting of HJB residual loss
- Sliced Wasserstein (intermediate) distribution matching
- endpoint total mass supervision

The authors ablate the endpoint total-mass supervision versus unbalanced AM, but several of the other choices lack ablation.

### Weaknesses
The clarity of the paper needs to be greatly improved.
- The velocity in the kinetic energy in Eq. 5 is not clearly specified, presumably corresponding to $v_{\text{corr}}$.  
- Please move Algorithm 1 earlier in the paper.
- The simulation scheme described in Lines 143-144 should be moved until after the optimality result below Eq 8 to make clear why $\dot{x} = v_{\text{prior}}(x,t) + \nabla s(x,t)$.     The authors should also consider expanding the discussion of the fixed $p_t$ parameterization, as previous work has sought to further optimize the interpolating $p_t$ with a further neural network.   
    - Algorithm 1 is unclear in specifying the samples on which we calculate the HJB residual loss.   What does sampling $[x, t, v_{\text{prior}}]$ mean?  It appears that RNA experiments may use local interval training with simulation from $x_t \sim p_{t, \text{data}}$ instead of $x_t \sim p_{t, \theta}$
    - HJB loss would benefit from explicit summation over K in the intermediate steps and and B in the endpoint expectations, as appropriate 

The sliced Wasserstein distance is presented as a loss on the final distributions $\hat{\rho}_1, \rho_1$ only.   However, Algorithm 1 implements this at intermediate steps using the pushforward from the previous timestep.
- The authors should discuss the differentiability of the Sliced W2 loss.   Do we backpropagate through the ODE dynamics?  How about the weights?  I presume these reweight the W2 calculation, but what about their gradients?


The proof of Theorem 3.4 is not provided.  I might prefer that this is presented before Corollary 3.3, since subsequent choices such as squared-residuals and reweighting in Eq. 10 do not necessarily yield the desired solutions.   Thm 3.4 appears to refer to the optimality of Eq. 8.


The description of the Gaussian Translation task should be improved (what is $v_{\text{prior}}$?).   The source distribution is not clear in Figure 1.

$v_{\text{ot}}$ is used in various places (L269, L624, 644)

### Questions
The importance weights in the HJB residual are calculated across different time points.   One could imagine that higher residuals in particular times would lead to the $s_t$ function nat these $t$ rarely being emphasized or optimized in the residual loss.   Does this occur?   Importance weighting $w_{t,b}$ across samples at a particular time point would require aligning times within a batch, but is a different, natural choice.


Is it reasonable to expect to have supervision on the total mass in unbalanced settings?  How is this ground-truth derived/estimated from data?

### Summary
The authors propose learning velocity prior-guided Hamiltonian-Jacobi flows, where they use velocity-prior to construct a velocity-informed variant of the HJB equation. They evaluate their approach on a range of synthetic and single-cell experiments, demonstrating their method is able to learn both curl-free and divergence-free velocity field and is compatible with unbalanced optimal transport setting. Moreover, the method is parametrized by a single neural network without a need to separately train growth term or the interpolant.

### Strengths
* **Motivation**: The paper strongly motivates learning velocity priors to capture more complex motion patterns such as rotational and cyclical motion
* **Use of single network**: The authors model non-straight paths in a complex dynamics setting with a single neural network used to to learn both transport and growth dynamics
* **Range of experiments**: The work is evaluated on wide range of real-world and synthetic experiments

### Weaknesses
* **Limited Novelty**: Work claims novelty over modeling cyclical and rotational patterns by using velocity-based prior approach. Recent work on Curly Flow Matching [1] already addresses this challenge by constructing velocity-prior informed stochastic interpolant, solving Schrödinger bridge problem with non-zero drift in a simulation-free setting. While Curly Flow Matching only considers balanced-distributional transport, two works should be compared and discussed in the related work section.
* **Presentation**: There are inconsistencies in notation across section 3. After reading carefully, I understand that $v_t^*$ in line 119 corresponds to learnable $v_{corr}$, and that $\dot{x}$ and $v_{total}$ match in line 144, but this could be simplified. The same applies to $g_t(x)$ vs $g(t,x)$ or $s(t,x)$, vs $s_t(x)$ vs $s(t, x(t))$ or $v$ in equation 6, which I believe should be $v_{total}$. In the petal example when showing overlay of vector fields, I would strongly recommend separating $v_{prior}$, $v_{ot}$ and $v_{total}$ as it is very hard to distinguish them.

### Questions
* Could you provide computational cost comparison across baselines in table 2 to proposed method? Could you also report EMD/W2 metrics and compare to other baselines in EB experiments?
* Could you provide baseline comparison (same set of baselines as in table 2) on bone marrow single-cell data and also report EMD/W2 metrics? How do you evaluate how close to the ground truth the learnt growth dynamics (shown in figure 3) is?
* It would be very interesting to see some robustness analysis of the proposed method further tested in a toy setting. I wonder if authors tried running a simple case of velocity-prior applied in classic OT-CFM [2] or SF2M [3] matching setting with balanced-distribution transport and with sliced Wasserstein objective. Does this still allow you to learn cyclical patterns? In the balanced toy experiments where I assume Action Matching without unbalanced transport is used as an FM algorithm, have you tested this in a toy setting where $\mu_0 = \mu_1$ to show whether model can learn fully cyclical trajectories under $\omega=const$ rotational field?
* Line 258 mentions work by Sun et al (2025) [4] which also uses single network to train velocity field and growth dynamics. Could you expand this comparison and explain in which cases VRUOT would fail due to the lack of velocity priors? As mentioned above, it would be great to include empirical comparison across SW/EMD/W2 as well as computational cost on EB and bone marrow examples, if possible.
* Are the weights in lines 174 to 180 same as weights in line 161? If not it would be good to add different notation to separate them. How does importance reweighting depend on the choice of temperature $\tau$? It would be good to provide an ablation study.
* Could you provide a further commentary on trade-off between using two separate networks used to model transport and growth? What is the guarantee that $s_t$ recovers correct growth dynamics in chosen experimental setting? It would be good to evaluate the quality of learnt growth dynamics in a synthetic setting and compare to baselines such as Sun et al (2025) [4]
