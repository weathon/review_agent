## Abstract
Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

### Summary
This paper studies the multivariate time series forecasting problem and focus on modeling cross-channel correlations, handling misalignment in sampling frequencies and periods, and dealing with missing data. Based on the challenge that no existing methods properly considered all these three aspects together, this paper proposed a new unified framework for doing that simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework against existing methods.

2. The proposed framework is straightforward and should be easy to replicate.

### Weaknesses
1. While the presentation of the existing challenges is quite detailed and straightforward, the paper could improve on the presentation of the design choices of the proposed method. Right now it is unintuitive how the proposed framework and its core design choices is effective at tackling the aforementioned challenges.
2. The paper could elaborate further on the technical contribution of the proposed method, how it advances on top of existing methods and techniques.

### Questions
Could the authors elaborate on the motivation of their proposed framework, so that it is clearer how their proposed framework can effectively tackle the listed challenges and introduce technical contribution?

### Summary
This paper introduces ChannelTokenFormer (CTF), a novel Transformer-based framework for multivariate time series forecasting designed to be robust to real-world data challenges. The authors identify three key challenges that often co-occur in practice but are typically addressed in isolation by existing methods: (1) complex inter-channel dependencies, (2) channel-wise asynchronous sampling (different channels having different sampling rates), and (3) block-wise missing values at test time.

The core contribution is a unified model that handles these three challenges simultaneously without relying on interpolation, which can introduce spectral distortion. The key components of CTF are: 1.Channel Tokens: Repurposed from prior work, these tokens act as global summaries or "attention anchors" for each channel. 2. Frequency-Based Dynamic Patching: Each channel is patched non-uniformly based on its dominant frequency (detected via FFT) and sampling rate, naturally accommodating asynchrony. 3. Unified Mask-Guided Attention: A single attention mechanism processes both local (patch) tokens and global (channel) tokens. A carefully designed attention mask controls information flow, allowing local tokens to attend only within their channel, while channel tokens can aggregate information from their own local tokens and other channel tokens, enabling cross-channel communication. 4. Patch Masking: Missing blocks are handled by simply removing the corresponding local tokens from the input, a strategy for which the model is prepared via random patch masking during training.

The authors conduct extensive experiments on "practical" versions of four standard benchmarks (ETT, Weather, SolarWind) and two real-world datasets (EPA-Air, LNG Cargo Handling). The results demonstrate that CTF consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art models in settings with asynchronous sampling and test-time missingness.

### Strengths
1. The paper tackles a crucial, real-world problem by addressing channel dependency, asynchrony, and missingness in a unified manner, moving beyond the idealized assumptions common in much of the literature.
2. The proposed ChannelTokenFormer, with its unified mask-guided attention, offers an elegant solution that avoids signal-distorting interpolation. The integration of frequency-based dynamic patching is a smart way to handle heterogeneous sampling rates.
3. The paper is exceptionally clear, well-written, and illustrated, making the contributions easy to understand and appreciate. The detailed appendix further underscores the quality and care put into the research.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors compare their method with mainly channel-dependent transformer-based methods. However, many methods have achieved SOTA performance with non-transformer architectures [1] [2]. Comparison with these methods is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.

2. The section introducing the research methodology lacks essential mathematical formulas and specific descriptive details, which creates certain difficulties for readers to fully understand the implementation logic and operational steps of the proposed method. It is recommended to supplement the core formulas and elaborate on key technical parameters or procedural details to enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the methodology.

3. The unified attention mechanism has a computational complexity that is quadratic in the total number of tokens (patches + channel tokens). The authors' own analysis shows OOM at 280 channels on a 24GB GPU. While sufficient for many applications, this could be a limitation for very high-dimensional problems with thousands of channels, such as the Traffic prediction problems [3]

4. This article uses frequency-domain information for assistance, but it does not conduct a comparison of frequency-domain methods [4][5].

### Summary
A practical forecasting setting is introduced where three core real-world challenges occur simultaneously: channel-wise asynchronous sampling, block-wise missing intervals, and complex crosschannel dependencies. Instead of interpolation, this approach handles both missing segments and sampling gaps through masking and frequency-based dynamic patching.

### Strengths
1、Multivariate time series forecasting is important to various domains.

2、There are quite a few nice illustrations.

3、This work focuses on an important problem that could have real-world applications.

4、The figures and tables used in this work are clear and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
1、The proposed algorithm has notable limitations. The authors should further clarify whether their method can effectively handle missing values during training, especially in scenarios where missing values appear in a discrete rather than continuous manner. It remains unclear how the model ensures robustness and applicability under such conditions.

2、In addition, although the authors claim that their method addresses three key challenges in real-world scenarios—variable modeling, multi-source asynchrony, and missing values—many other critical issues in time series analysis are not discussed, such as non-stationarity, concept drift, and probabilistic forecasting. As a result, the paper’s overall logic appears somewhat fragmented, lacking a coherent and systematic research focus.

3、In the comparison section, the authors only include several Channel-Dependent methods from 2023 and 2024. However, as a paper submitted to ICLR 2026, it fails to compare against more recent representative works published in 2025, which weakens the experimental credibility and timeliness.

4、In lines 295–296, the authors claim that their method ensures computational efficiency. However, from an implementation perspective, introducing a mask mechanism does not actually reduce computational costs. On the contrary, when the dataset contains a large number of variables, the computational overhead of the proposed method may increase significantly, potentially reducing overall efficiency.

5、In the NIPS 2024 workshop[1], some researchers pointed out that current methods sometimes use the "drop-last" trick [2] to improve performance. Therefore, It is recommended that you clarify whether the "drop - last" operation was used in your paper in the implementation details section of your paper for transparency.

If my problem is solved, I am willing to improve my score.

### Questions
1、The proposed algorithm appears to have notable limitations. Can the authors clarify whether their method can effectively handle missing values during training, especially when the missing values occur in a discrete rather than continuous manner? How does the model ensure robustness and applicability under such conditions?

2、Furthermore, while the authors claim that their method addresses variable modeling, multi-source asynchrony, and missing values, have they considered other equally important challenges in time series analysis, such as non-stationarity, concept drift, and probabilistic forecasting? Could the omission of these aspects make the overall logic of the paper appear fragmented and lacking a coherent research focus?

3、In the comparison section, the authors only include Channel-Dependent methods from 2023 and 2024. Why are more recent representative works from 2025, such as **TimeFilter** and **DUET**, not included in the comparison? Would the absence of these up-to-date baselines weaken the credibility and timeliness of the experimental results?

4、Lastly, in lines 295–296, the authors claim that their method ensures computational efficiency. However, does introducing a mask mechanism actually reduce computational costs? When the dataset contains a large number of variables, wouldn’t the computational overhead instead increase significantly, thereby affecting the overall efficiency?

If my problem is solved, I am willing to improve my score.

### Summary
This paper introduces ChannelTokenFormer, a unified Transformer-based framework targeting robust multivariate time series forecasting under three often neglected but crucial real-world conditions: channel-wise asynchronous sampling, block-wise missingness at test time, and complex cross-channel dependencies. The model employs a mask-guided unified attention mechanism with channel tokens, frequency-driven dynamic patching per channel, and explicit patch masking for missingness during training and inference. The approach is evaluated on several benchmark and real-world datasets (including channel-heterogeneous resamplings and a large-scale industrial application), consistently demonstrating improved performance versus state-of-the-art baselines, both under idealized and challenging practical setups.

### Strengths
1. The paper formalizes a comprehensive and realistic forecasting challenge: simultaneous handling of dependency, asynchrony, and missingness, as illustrated clearly in Figure 1, moving beyond isolated treatment of these aspects in prior works.
2. The paper introduces a unified mask-guided attention mechanism for channel tokens (see Figure 2 and Figure 3) that elegantly separates local intra-channel modeling from cross-channel global aggregation, supporting asynchronous and missing inputs naturally.
3. The model integrates frequency analysis (FFT-driven patch length selection) to respect per-channel periodicities and sampling densities, supported by theorized and empirical evidence (Appendix, Table 9).
4.  Patch masking for both training and test scenarios is well-motivated and shown to bolster model robustness. The ablation studies reinforce the necessity and effectiveness of each mechanism, especially for structured block-wise missingness.
5.  Detailed quantitative experiments across a rich collection of public and industrial datasets, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2, show state-of-the-art performance. Ablations in the appendix clarify the interplay among model components.
6.  The paper provides in-depth analysis of interpolation-induced spectral distortion justifying the benefits of the interpolation-free approach and thoughtfully connecting theory with practical modeling.
7. The method's scalability to high channel counts and long sequences is empirically demonstrated (**Table 12, Table 13**), supporting claims of practical deployability.

### Weaknesses
1.  While practical motivation for the mask-guided attention and frequency-based patching is strong, the formal theoretical analysis is somewhat lacking.  For example, the impact of frequency-based patching on generalization is empirically supported but not mathematically justified.
2. The bulk of the validation is empirical, with most arguments for effectiveness given by ablations and performance gains. The absence of principled theoretical results or proofs (e.g., why the particular masking scheme is optimal or robust under certain classes of missingness) is noticeable. For example, the construction of attention masks (as shown in **Figures 7, 8, 9**) is justified via heuristic motivation rather than analytical optimality or formal properties.
3. The manuscript provides a detailed exposition of the proposed method; however, certain sections are densely structured and may be difficult for readers to follow. In addition, the notation conventions—such as the definitions of the mask matrix, channel tokens, and sampling factors (see Sections 3 and 4)—are somewhat cumbersome and could benefit from simplification or clearer explanations. Moreover, some formulas are embedded directly within the main text, which further hinders readability and could be better presented as numbered equations or in a dedicated formula environment.
4. The modification of canonical datasets into "practical" versions (e.g., Weather-practical, SolarWind) relies on synthetic resampling and missingness injection, which may bias the comparison to baselines. While the intention and utility of these datasets are strong, it is unclear how they reflect real-world statistical complexity versus controlled synthetic heterogeneity, and possible overfitting to constructed artifacts cannot be ruled out.
5.  While the main architecture is described at a reasonably high level, some key hyperparameters are not specified in detail and are only provided as approximate ranges. Given the relatively complex pipeline and variable-dependent model configuration, this may hinder independent replication.
6. Appendix B discusses the spectral effects of interpolation (with supporting figures), but the argument remains somewhat qualitative. Providing a more comprehensive, formal, and comparative mathematical analysis, including its impact on prediction accuracy and data outcomes, could enhance the scientific value and make the frequency-related discussion more broadly applicable.
7.  The paper acknowledges some scalability and generalization challenges in the conclusion but otherwise does not engage deeply with possible failure modes or cases where ChannelTokenFormer might underperform (e.g., non-stationary environments, highly irregular or bursty missingness patterns, or settings with weak cross-channel structure).
8. Limited Superiority in Conventional Settings: Although the model is evaluated on regularly sampled multivariate time series without missing values to demonstrate its general applicability, the results shown in Table 15 indicate that it does not consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art baselines in this conventional forecasting setting. This suggests that the architectural advantages of ChannelTokenFormer—designed primarily for handling asynchrony and missingness—may not translate into clear gains when data are fully observed and regularly sampled.

### Questions
1. Can the authors provide more insights or theoretical grounding for why the proposed mask-guided attention scheme is robust to a wide variety of missingness patterns and channel asynchrony, beyond heuristic and experimental support?
2. How sensitive is the model to hyperparameters governing patch size selection—especially when the dominant period is weak or ambiguous? Could a poorly tuned FFT threshold degrade performance?
3. Regarding dataset construction: can the authors clarify to what extent the practical benchmark setups (modified from canonical datasets) reflect organic missingness and sampling asynchrony found in the wild, rather than synthetically controlled structures? Can the robustness of CTF be validated on additional non-synthetic real-world datasets?
4. Could the authors expand on which failure modes arise with their approach (e.g., with highly bursty, uncorrelated missingness, or in scenarios with low cross-channel redundancy)?
5. As shown in Table 15, the model does not achieve state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon forecasting tasks under conventional multivariate settings. Does this indicate that its practical effectiveness may be limited when the data are fully observed and regularly sampled?
