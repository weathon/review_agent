## Abstract
Full-waveform inversion (FWI) estimates physical parameters in the wave equation from limited measurements and has been widely applied in geophysical exploration, medical imaging, and non-destructive testing. Conventional FWI methods are limited by their notorious sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial models. Recent progress in continuous representation FWI (CR-FWI) demonstrates that representing parameter models with a coordinate-based neural network, such as implicit neural representation (INR), can mitigate the dependence on initial models. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear, and INR-based FWI shows slower high-frequency convergence. In this work, we investigate the general CR-FWI framework and develop a unified theoretical understanding by extending the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for FWI to establish a wave-based NTK framework. Unlike standard NTK, our analysis reveals that wave-based NTK is not constant, both at initialization and during training, due to the inherent nonlinearity of FWI. We further show that the eigenvalue decay behavior of the wave-based NTK can explain why CR-FWI alleviates the dependency on initial models and shows slower high-frequency convergence. Building on these insights, we propose several CR-FWI methods with tailored eigenvalue decay properties for FWI, including a novel hybrid representation combining INR and multi-resolution grid (termed IG-FWI) that achieves a more balanced trade-off between robustness and high-frequency convergence rate. Applications in geophysical exploration on Marmousi, 2D SEG/EAGE Salt and Overthrust, 2004 BP model, and the more realistic 2014 Chevron models show the superior performance of our proposed methods compared to conventional FWI and existing INR-based FWI methods.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a unified theoretical analysis framework based on the wave kernel and
wave-based NTK to investigate the convergence and robustness of both conventional and continuous representation FWI. Their analysis reveals the distinct eigenvalue decay patterns, which explain why traditional FWI has fast convergence but lacks robustness, while INR-based CRFWI has improved robustness but with slower convergence. Motivated by theoretical analysis, they introduce a hybrid
representation that integrates INR with a multigrid strategy for FWI, aiming to balance robustness
and convergence. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a unified wave-based Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework that connects conventional FWI and CR-FWI. It provides a solid theoretical explanation for observed differences in convergence and robustness across FWI variants.

2. Across multiple benchmarks, the proposed methods show strong performance and robustness under different conditions (e.g., noisy data, poor initial models, missing low-frequency content, etc).

3. For the most part, the manuscript is generally well written, clearly organized, and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Missing discussion of weighting factor $\alpha$. The weighting factor α in IG-FWI is introduced but never discussed or ablated. Since it determines the balance between Robustness and Convergence, its selection strategy and sensitivity analysis should be provided.

2. Lack of convergence evidence. Although the convergence rate is repeatedly discussed in the paper, the paper does not show any related results, e.g., convergence curves, generated velocity visualizations corresponding to different iterations, or the number of iterations required to converge.

3. The claim that “IG-FWI achieves an optimal trade-off between robustness and convergence rate” is overclaimed. The paper provides no formal definition or proof of optimality.

4. The multi-grid parametric encoding module is largely adapted from the existing INR paper. While this integration is effective, it somewhat limits the originality of the methodological contribution.

5. The Figures 10-15 in the Appendix are in very low resolution. Replacing them with high-resolution or vector graphics would improve readability.

### Questions
1. Missing experiments about $\alpha$ and convergence. Please refer to Weakness for more details.

2. The introduction of LR-FWI seems insufficiently motivated and conceptually detached from the main theoretical analysis. Its role within the paper is unclear. Could you please clarify its motivation and the connection of the LR-FWI with other parts of the paper?

### Summary
The authors study full waveform inversion (FWI), in particular the case where the material field is parameterized with a neural network (the "continuous representation FWI"). Previous work has identified challenges such as slow convergence for high frequencies, but good performance and fast convergence for smooth fields. Two main questions are adressed: how to explain the differences in robustness and convergence between conventional and network-based FWI, and how to find a continuous representation (e.g., neural network) that can achieve a good trade-off between accuracy in the high frequency domain and convergence speed.
The authors use the neural tangent kernel perspective to study the frequency domain properties, and introduce a combination of representations tailored to FWI problems, including multigrid approaches, to resolve the frequency issues.
The theoretical results are supported by several computational experiments in seismic imaging, where the approach works well.

### Strengths
1) The authors employ NTK theory to study the spectral bias problem when using neural networks in an FWI setting. This is a very well defined problem, and has not been addressed in a lot of previous studies; even though the idea of using neural netowkrs for the material field is used in several works. This makes the study particularly relevant, not just for seismic imaging, but also nondestructive testing.
2) The authors not only analyze the issues of FWI in this setting, but also propose a new method using multigrid, and demonstrate its performance in 2D examples. This makes this work a significant advancement in the field.
3) The appendix includes a thorough explanation of the proof, as well as details on the experiments.

### Weaknesses
* The manuscript contains the term "nonlinear partial differential equation" multiple times (l011, l046, l104, l107, l232), but equation (1) is a linear PDE (the classical wave equation). The linearity of the wave equation does not matter for the inverse problem being nonlinear, but it is strange that the authors refer to the nonlinearity so often.
 * More literature on FWI with neural networks material fields should be cited.

 * Only 2D examples are considered, not 3D. There is a significant computational challenge in FWI going from 2D to 3D, and it is not clear if the proposed method can still be used there.

### Questions
1) Why do the authors refer to the wave equation being nonlinear, and then state it as a linear PDE? There are nonlinear wave equations, but eq. 1 is not.
2) What is the time and memory complexity of the method introduced in the manuscript? FWI is used beyond seismic imaging (e.g. in nondestructive testing), in 3D domains, where the computational challenge is much larger than in 2d domains.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of full-waveform Inversion (FWI) and investigates the mechanisms that cause the differences between conventional FWI and continuous representation FWI (CR-FWI) in robustness and convergence. Through a series of theoretical analyses from the perspective of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), the authors identified that these differences arise from different eigenvalue decay behaviors. Based on these observations, the authors further proposed LR-FWI, MPE-FWI, and IG-FWI, which aim to achieve a trade-off between robustness and convergence. Experimental results on several datasets and scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. I think the insights regarding eigenvalue decay behaviors are valuable to the community for future algorithm development.
2. The authors provided solid, step-by-step derivations of the theories proposed in the paper. 
3. The proposed methods (MPE-FWI and IG-FWI) have clear theories to explain their performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and convergence. 
4. The proposed methods achieved superior performance on the public benchmark datasets, which is convincing.

### Weaknesses
1. Among the proposed methods, LR-FWI lacks an analysis of its eigenvalue decay behavior and is discussed much less than the other two methods (MPE-FWI and IG-FWI). I think it is important as LR-FWI yields promising performance, and it even outperforms IG-FWI in some cases.
2. Although data-driven and physics-informed FWI methods are covered in the related works section, they are missing in the experiments. The experiments can be more solid by including a few of them as the additional baselines.

### Questions
1. The authors proposed to integrate a tiny INR and MPE in IG-FWI. Can the tiny INR be replaced with other INR-based methods such as LR-FWI?
2. In IG-FWI, the features from the tiny INR and MPE are concatenated with a weighting factor $\alpha$. What are the values of $\alpha$ in different experiments? Is the algorithm sensitive to the value of $\alpha$?
3. In Table 1, given smooth initial models, MPE-FWI performs worse than CR-FWI baselines except for Marmousi, but it should have slower eigenvalue decay. Could you please provide an explanation or analysis of these results? 
4. [minor] In Equation 4 and Equation 7, there is $(\mathbf{x}’, t’)$ before $dt’d\mathbf{x}’$. What’s the meaning of this notation? From my understanding, they are redundant.

### Summary
The paper develops a wave-based Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis for continuous-representation FWI (CR-FWI), explains why INRs help (and why they converge slowly at high frequency), and proposes practical CR-FWI variants (including a hybrid INR + multiresolution grid, IG-FWI). The submission claims strong empirical results on standard FWI benchmarks (Marmousi, SEG/EAGE Salt & Overthrust, 2004 BP, 2014 Chevron).

### Strengths
- Interdisciplinary theoretical contribution. The wave-based NTK framework is a thoughtful specialization of NTK tools to FWI that helps explain observed phenomena (robustness to initialization, spectral bias / slow high-freq convergence). This new perspective can guide architecture and sampling choices.

- Use of standard, realistic benchmarks. The authors report results on well-known FWI models (Marmousi, SEG/EAGE Salt & Overthrust, BP, Chevron). Using these makes the claims more credible to applied communities and shows practical intent.

- Actionable design proposal (IG-FWI). The hybrid INR + multi-resolution grid is a practical idea that directly follows from the kernel eigenvalue arguments and aims to trade off robustness vs convergence speed.

### Weaknesses
- Ablation & failure modes. The paper claims IG-FWI is an “optimal trade-off” — I’d expect ablations that vary eigenvalue decay (e.g., different INR frequency bases, different grid scales) and show how performance changes. Please also show failure cases.

- The paper does not compare CR-FWI or IG-FWI with data-driven inversion methods (e.g., supervised CNN-based methods) on synthetic datasets such as OpenFWI. These baselines are now standard in the ML-driven FWI literature. The omission limits the ability to judge the practical competitiveness of the proposed framework relative to current deep-learning-based inversion systems.
