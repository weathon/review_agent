# Prompts to Proxies: Emulating Human Preferences via a Compact LLM Ensemble

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 2, 6

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) often collapse toward average responses, obscuring the diversity needed to model different population-level preferences. While prompting can steer models toward diverse responses, it remains a non-trivial challenge on how it can be used to efficiently align with the preference of a target population. We propose a new theoretical lens, preference reconstruction theory, which formalizes population preference alignment as the construction of a functional basis of proxy agents. We implement this via Prompts-to-Proxies (P2P), a framework for preference reconstruction that formulates alignment as a two-stage problem. First, we use structured prompting with entropy-based adaptive sampling to construct a diverse set of endowed agents, each representing a vector in the latent preference space. Second, we reconstruct the population preference by estimating sparse weights over these agents via L1-regularized regression, aligning resulting aggregate response distribution with observed data. This yields a compact proxy population that captures both scope and distribution of preferences without demographic conditioning. P2P offers a cost-effective alternative to large-scale personalization and a principled testbed for studying pluralistic alignment. We validate the approach through an empirical evaluation on 14 waves of the American Trends Panel, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, substantial diversity, and cross-domain generalization.

### Summary
This paper introduces Prompts-to-Proxies (P2P), a framework to emulate population-level preferences through a two-stage process. Importantly, grounded in preference reconstruction theory, the authors argue that instead of learning a one-to-one mapping from human subgroups to model personas, it is sufficient to construct a functional basis of diverse proxy agents and learn sparse aggregation weights that reconstruct aggregate responses. Specifically, stage 1 employs generation of endowed agents using entropy-based adaptive sampling to create diverse agent personas from a structured attribute bank. Those agents are used to generate diverse basis. Stage 2 uses L1-regularized regression over agent responses to match population aggregates and select a parsimonious ensemble. The approach is validated on American Trends Panel (ATP), showing lower test MSE and higher response entropy than baselines with modest cost.

### Strengths
< Strength >

- The preference reconstruction theory provides an mathematical justification for the approach. The formalization that population preferences can be represented via multiple ensemble configurations without requiring one-to-one demographic mapping is both theoretically sound and practically impactful. 
- The paper addresses a real social science challenge with a theoretically grounded solution, and tested on realistic dataset (ATP) compared to existing alignment method papers.
- The paper presents concrete ablation studies examining key components covering endowment budgets, regression methods, and model backends
- The two-stage architecture cleanly separates diversity generation from preference reconstruction, enabling independent improvement and modification of each component. The attribute bank structure is also extensible.

### Weaknesses
< Weakness >

- Main concern
    - Although the method is theoretically attractive, the proposed method doesn’t address the core motivation of avoiding averaging out minority perspectives. The paper didn’t demonstrate how the proposed method can address and model minor preference more accurately either theoretically or empirically.
    - Similarly, The motivation of declining public willingness to participate in surveys for specific regions/demographics (in line 69-72) raises a question that are not empirically proven. If certain groups are underrepresented in training data, how can the proposed method reliably emulate their preferences?
- About the metric and evaluation
    - One of the main statement, "captures both scope and distribution of preferences" in abstract, is not empirically supported. The paper motivates the work around preserving minority preferences, but the evaluation metric (MSE on averages) cannot verify this claim. The evaluation metrics used, MSE, cannot guarantee capturing the true distribution's variance or tail behaviors.
    - The proposed stage1 mostly focus on generating diverse persona, and entropy is also used for the evaluation metrics. Unlike simple data construction, higher entropy alone doesn't guarantee distributional fidelity as the paper is aiming of emulating human preferences. High standard deviation in generated samples may not reproduce the true population distribution. The method maximizes entropy without theoretical justification for why maximum entropy leads to better population representation.
- About design choice
    - While the functional perspective sidesteps one-to-one mapping requirements, the latent personas lose the practical benefit interpretability.
    - As state in Line 214, "attributes are typically viewed as reflections of latent preferences" in humans, yet P2P uses them generatively for models. This inversion needs stronger justification as the paper previously concretely define the decision-making process in Equation 1. What is the advantage of generating the basis with this inversion?
- About the experiment
    - Based on the concept of generating multiple persona, simple embedding clustering (e.g., k-means on persona embeddings) could serve as a stronger baseline than the current Vanilla approach
    - Table 1 shows Elastic Net performs better, contradicting the method section's focus on Lasso for selection and keeping essential basis. Elastic Net is not strictly a variable selection method.
- Concern on clarity
    - The paper introduces extensive new terminology (mode, variability score, tracker, attribute learner, question patching, mixed mode) without sufficient intuitive grounding. Table 6 only shows high-level categories. Additional material such as an intuitive example for a single scenario or unified flow diagram showing how all components interact, or table that summarizing the concept would greatly improve the clarity.
- Minor issues
    - I guess the sentence should be combined to be more fluent, “As the prompt space is far too vast to explore in an unstructured manner. To address this, we adopt a structured prompting strategy based on attributes” (Line 205)

### Questions
- Lines 473-474 claim the method can support "survey design, question testing, and nonresponse mitigation", which is valuably practical, but provide insufficient detail on implementation. How would practitioners actually deploy the proposed method for these applications?
- The motivation stresses avoiding “averaging out” minority perspectives, but the evaluation focuses on MSE of means. Could authors add metrics or analyses that directly test this recovery? Simple toy experiment with ground truth sub-groups would be sufficient.
- Table 1 shows that Elastic net performs better. Do authors have a explanation on that, as it contradicts to the role of Stage2? If the authors think Enet is better method than Lasso on their purpose, it would be better to modify abstract/intro, as they are focused on Lasso method.
- Does the author has a rationale of Stage1 compared to simple approach such as generating multiple prompts and combining them with simple embedding clustering? It would be even greater if author can add it as a baseline.

### Summary
Pluralistic alignment is a relatively new research area within LLM alignments. These methodologies attempt to alignLLMs with a diverse set of human preferences in comparison to standard LLM alignment methodologies which attempts to align LLMs with a single gold-standard set of human preferences. In this paper, the authors formulate a two staged process for pluralistic alignment - (1) an endowment generation process that attempts to form a functional basis for the human responses (2) a regression based aggregation which attempts to ensure that the net aggregation models the population level preferences. The paper examines this methodology using the revealed preference theory.

Through empirical experiments, the authors show that the two staged process shows better results when measured by MSE in comparison to baselines - (1) a single agent and (2) 300 agents from the PERSONA dataset. The paper further shows ablation studies over various design choices and several LLM backend

### Strengths
1. The novelty in this work is clear. The two staged process - using an endowment generation process to form a functional basis over the human preferences followed by a regression step to aggregate the agents responses is a novel idea.
2. The empirical results shows that this method shows better alignment in comparison to the baselines selected in the paper

### Weaknesses
1. A strong limitation of this method is that this is limited to survey style problems with multiple choice questions. It is not clear how this method could be applied to problems which require free text generation
2. As discussed in the related works, there are existing papers tackling pluralistic alignment problems. It is not clear how this solution performs relative to existing works. I would encourage the authors to add empirical results comparing this performance to Chen et al 2025, Feng et al 2024, Sorensen et al 2024b.
3. There is room for improvement in presentation of this paper. It is particularly difficult to parse through Sections 3.2 and 3.3. The authors could formalize the end-to-end algorithm which would make it easier to understand the proposed solution.

### Questions
1. Why have LLMs led to a shift away from SFT and RLHF? [Lines 033-035]
2. How can this method be applied to LLMs where free text generation is required?
3. Are the modes in the experiments consistent across all three models - the vanilla baseline, the PERSONA dataset and P2P model?

### Summary
In order to predict population-level human averages to survey questions, the paper learns an ensemble of agents (defined by prompts steering to diverse attributes). It then fits a regression on top of the agents' responses to approximate the true population average. The authors evaluate their method on data from OpinionQA.

### Strengths
The paper attempts to recover the population-level average survey responses through a weighted basis of "agents", which is a potentially interesting idea, though there are several weaknesses in the execution, listed below.

### Weaknesses
# Minimal theoretical contribution
In the introduction, the paper states as one of its contributions that it provides a "theoretical foundation" for their approach. However, the theoretical content presented in Section 3 is superficial.

For example, the authors state "A direct consequence is that if human population preference is learnable in the revealed sense, so is individual human preference—we defer the proof to Appendix A."  However, it does not make sense that they "defer the proof" because the deferred proof is one line and follows directly from the Defn 2.2. There is no need to create a proposition for this; the authors can simply state this observation.

Similarly, Thm 1 and Thm 2 also follow directly from Defn 2.2.

Additionally, the theorems are not written in a formal manner. For example, the statement “If human population preference is learnable in the revealed sense, the ensemble of LLM agents that can learn this is not unique” lacks preciseness. In general, clarity could be significantly improved.

Overall, the theoretical contributions are minimal and do not add substantial value to the paper.

# Greater contrast to distributional alignment
The authors focus on developing a method that matches the population mean of survey responses. However, this appears to be strictly less powerful than constructing a model whose responses are calibrated to the full distribution of the population, as one could simply sample from such a model and compute the average. Maybe there is a computational efficiency argument to be made here about requiring fewer samples from the model, but I think the authors need to do more to justify why they take their approach and better situate their work in the literature on distributional alignment.

# Experiments

The authors compare their method to two baselines, both of which fit within the overall framework of their approach: (1) constructing a set of diverse agents, and (2) running a regression on the agents' responses to match the observed population mean. The two baselines differ only in how the agents are constructed in step (1), and both use less comprehensive methods than the authors’ full approach. The evaluation would be more compelling if the authors compared their method to entirely different approaches, such as the one proposed in Cao et al. (2025), which is already cited in the paper. It would also be helpful to report the performance of the original model backend to better contextualize the potential improvement.

It is strange to me that the authors evaluate their method across 14 waves, but only evaluate against the baselines for a much smaller subset---just one of the waves. This raises the question of whether the method actually improves compared to the baseline across the larger dataset. I recommend that the authors provide baseline results for all waves to allow for a more comprehensive comparison.

Additionally, the evaluation is limited to OpinionQA, which focuses solely on the American population. This raises questions about the generalizability of the method to other populations. The evaluation could be strengthened by including results on GlobalOpinionQA and assessing the method’s ability to approximate population responses across different countries. If the experiments are not possible, this should at least be acknowledged as a potential limitation.

### Questions
- What model is Table 1 using?

Btw since the paper is focused on human attributes, this paper might also be a relevant reference:

### Summary
The authors propose Prompts-to-Proxies (P2P) as a way to reconstruct population preferences for LLM alignment. P2P is a two-stage framework for pluralistic alignment that 1) generates a diverse basis of LLM agents via attribute-driven prompts with entropy-guided sampling and 2) reconstructs a target population’s response distribution by learning weights over the agents outputs. The authors motivate this via preference reconstruction theory where they argue that population preferences are learnable by non-unique ensembles that span the revealed preference space. They also share empirical results comparing aggregated responses with the American Trends Panel survey showing better performance in MSE and avg entropy vs baselines.

### Strengths
S1. The two-stage framework is clearly defined and has a principled diversity objective. The active endowment generation is guided by normalized question entropy and a mode-level variability score over training questions, with adaptive sampling and question patching for targeting low-entropy questions. This approach seems simple and effective in relation to the pluralistic alignment goals and is well-backed up by the theoretical development of the preference reconstruction theory the authors present.

S2. The authors present useful ablations of the technique across endowment budget, the regression-based aggregation module, and different model backends. The finding that model performance is highly variable is not surprising and may contribute to challenges in replicability over the long-term but it seems the authors have tried to mitigate this well wherever possible.

S3. The research shows broad empirical results and the cost considerations help with adoption and impact assessment. Cost comparisons against PERSONA baseline support the claims of the authors on the cost-effectiveness of the approach.

S4. The authors present a useful analysis against a well-validated survey in the form of the American Trends Panel work from Pew. Although this work is restricted in applicability to the US, which already shows higher alignment from current model training than other areas in the world, the setup allows for easy scaling to other locales.

### Weaknesses
W1. Despite the strengths there are a number of weaknesses to the synthetic data generation approach and validation through survey methods. In particular: limited evaluation metrics or good diagnostics. There is not any analysis of the calibration of the responses against human reviewers or any other spot checking of the endowments to validate the metric-driven results.

W2. In section 4 the comparison set omits key survey response distribution simulation baselines. While PERSONA and a vanilla generator are useful references, recent methods closer in spirit like Cao et al (2025) “Specializing Large Language Models to Simulate Survey Response Distributions for Global Populations” are not empirically compared. A head-to-head on shared survey tasks would strengthen claims about efficiency and fidelity and inclusion of standard metrics like Jenson-Shannon divergence and Earth Mover Distance on the distribution accuracy would help validate.

W3. In the current paper there is some risk of overfitting to the survey artifacts of the American Trends Panel. Because training and selection operate over distributions of responses to specific items from the same panel, the agents could be learning survey-specific heuristics rather than stable latent preferences. Cross-dataset generalization (e.g., OpinionsQA -> a distinct polling corpus) is not shown and understanding if this method could scale to multiple survey types and structures would be very beneficial in validating the impact of this work.

W4. These evaluations are also all tied to multiple-choice labeling. The current pipeline only handles categorical options and binarizes heterogeneous scales to fit the regression system, implicitly up-weighting multi-point Likert items. This design choice can bias what the model learns as “preference,” and the authors themselves note reweighting/format transformation might be needed but no sensitivity analysis is conducted.

W5. The connection between model steerability and a given models’ ability to represent the response distribution for a given population mixture of human responses is not fully explored. Although ablations on different models are conducted. As shown in Kirk et al (2024) “The PRISM Alignment Dataset” there are quite a range of group dimensions beyond the core/thematictheoretical template groups which can be used as attributes for group representation. Different models have different default steerability across these dimensions. Developing a measure of model steerability for group attributes would help ground the model selection for this use-case and for the general problem of pluralistic alignment.

### Questions
Q1. How sensitive are results to the attributes selected for the attribute bank? Reporting a variance analysis where you 1) shuffle or replace entire modes 2) vary attribute counts per endowment or 3) ablate the free-form survey/question-derived attributes would help with understanding the impact of this selection. Measuring the change in entropy, sparsity, and test MSE would be useful?

Q2. The authors mention that response rates to surveys are dropping across regions and demographics (i.e. human behavior is continuing to change) and synthetic agents can offer a way to simulate public opinion. How can we continue to validate that the synthetic agents maintain their distributional representation over time if they are developed for a single moment-in-time?

Q3. Since a key part of pluralistic alignment is the ability to avoid excluding minority perspectives in larger groups, it would be helpful too understand if the P2P method has any benefits or regressions with respect to subgroups (e.g. age / education-level) in the case where that subgroup may not be represented directly in the ensemble.
