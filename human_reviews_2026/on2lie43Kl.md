## Abstract
Recent years have seen rigorous proofs of quantum advantages in machine learning, particularly when data is labeled by cryptographic or inherently quantum functions. These results typically rely on the infeasibility of classical polynomial-sized circuits to evaluate the true labeling function. While broad in scope, these results however reveal little about advantages stemming from the actual learning process itself. This motivates the study of the so-called identification task, where the goal is to ``just'' identify the labeling function behind a dataset, making the learning step the only possible source of advantage. The identification task also has natural applications, which we discuss. Yet, such identification advantages remain poorly understood. So far they have only been proven in cryptographic settings by leveraging random-generatability, the ability to efficiently generate labeled data. However, for quantum functions this property is conjectured not to hold, leaving identification advantages unexplored. In this work, we provide the first proofs of identification learning advantages for quantum functions under complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our main result relies on a new proof strategy, allowing us to show that for a broad class of quantum identification tasks there exists an exponential quantum advantage unless BQP is in a low level of the polynomial hierarchy. Along the way we prove a number of more technical results including the aforementioned conjecture that quantum functions are not random generatable (subject to plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions), which shows a new proof strategy was necessary. These findings suggest that for many quantum-related learning tasks, the entire learning process—not just final evaluation—gains significant advantages from quantum computation

### Summary
The authors provide a theoretical proof of the hardness of a class of identification problems, thus constructing a classical–quantum separation in the context of PAC learning theory under widely believed complexity conjectures. This result can be considered a generalization of Huang et al. (2021) and Gyurik and Dunjko (2023), and it deepens our understanding of the power of data in quantum learning algorithms. However, for the reasons below (please refer to the Weaknesses section), I cannot recommend accepting this paper in its current form. If the authors adequately address my concerns, I may change the rate.

### Strengths
This paper is well written and logically clear. The chosen topic is highly significant, as it helps to characterize the classical–quantum boundary within the framework of computational complexity.

### Weaknesses
1. Regarding your first two results (Theorems 1 and 2): these statements seem quite unsurprising. Since the target function f essentially defines a BQP language, it follows that a polynomial-time classical algorithm cannot generate such samples. I do not find these two results surprising.

2. The main claim appears in Theorem 5, which establishes classical hardness. But to demonstrate a classical–quantum separation one must also show an efficient quantum algorithm. In fact, even if f is produced by a quantum device, that does not imply a quantum-machine-learning (QML) algorithm can solve the problem. For example, if the dataset encodes ground-state properties that reveal complex topological order, QML algorithms might still struggle to recognize it. Thus the authors have only proven classical hardness; they have not demonstrated quantum efficiency. As a result, an exponential quantum advantage is not rigorously established.

### Questions
Here are some questions:

1. Can the authors give some examples of the average-case-smooth concept class, especially in the quantum computing setting?

2. Regarding Theorem 5: why does L, unif \in BPP^{3NP} lead to a contradiction? To the best of my knowledge, the relationship between these two classes is not known.

3. Could the authors provide an efficient quantum algorithm for learning the classically hard cases indicated in Theorem 5?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new regime of quantum machine learning that focuses on potential advantages in solely the learning/training step while foregoing the testing steps. The authors analyze the hardness of the learning task itself with theoretical learning frameworks (proper PAC learning) to hypotheses in complexity theory that are believed to be true (BQP not contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy). Their main result shows that there exists a broad class of identification tasks of quantum functions that are quantumly-easy and classically hard.

### Strengths
1. This paper shows that quantum-hard functions are not generally classically generatable, and certain quantum generated data may only be learned by quantum learners.
2. Formal connections of learning theory and complexity theory regarding this task are constructed in this paper.

### Weaknesses
1. While the existence of separations are shown, to my understanding, the paper does not provide a potential path to the construction of a quantum learner that can provide such learnability results.
2. Minor typo in last line of Appendix A.3: $\mathtt{HeurBPP}^{\tt NP}$

### Questions
1. How applicable are the main theorems to existing QML problems? The paper shows that Hamiltonian learning does not apply, but how does the results apply to problems like state/process tomography, circuit learning or (quantum-assisted) circuit compiling?
2. Does the paper provide any implications on QAOA-type algorithms, which has been shown to be universal?

### Summary
A central question in quantum machine learning is to determine which learning problems admit a genuine quantum advantage. In recent years, there have been rigorous proofs of quantum advantage for learning properties of functions, typically relying on the classical intractability of evaluating the labeling function. In this paper, the authors instead focus on the identification task—the problem of identifying the correct label from a dataset—which has not been thoroughly explored in prior work.

The authors provide the first rigorous proof of a quantum advantage for identification learning under well-founded complexity-theoretic assumptions. In particular, they show that if BQP is not contained in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, then there exists a family of quantumly-samplable functions—computable by a quantum polynomial-time algorithm—that cannot be identified by any classical efficient algorithm. The proof proceeds by contradiction: assuming the existence of a classical efficient identification algorithm, the authors construct an evaluation algorithm in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, contradicting the initial assumption.

### Strengths
The authors introduce a new task in quantum machine learning: identifying a function within a given concept class. At first glance, this appears easier than standard learning tasks, which typically require the learner not only to infer the target function but also to evaluate it on unseen data points. In contrast, here a classical learner need only output a description of the unknown function. Surprisingly, the authors show that even this seemingly simpler task remains hard for classical learners when the function is quantum-computable—assuming that BQP is not contained in the fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy.

### Weaknesses
This work lacks sufficient motivation from quantum physics or quantum information. Although the paper is titled quantum machine learning advantages, the main result is proved entirely using classical complexity-theoretic arguments. Specifically, the hardness argument proceeds by constructing a classical algorithm that evaluates the function in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, assuming the function can be efficiently identified classically, and then combining this with the heuristic separation result of Ran and Raz between PH and BQP. The authors include several physics-motivated examples of identification hardness in Appendix G, but the arguments are relatively straightforward: Appendix G.1 closely follows the approach of Molteni et al., while Appendices G.2 and G.3 present heuristic arguments that are not clearly explained or integrated into the main text.

In addition, the treatment of complexity-theoretic assumptions in the paper lacks precision. For example, in Theorem 15, the authors claim the existence of a quantum-computable learning task that is not classically identifiable by any approximately correct algorithm. The proof relies on showing that an efficient classical identification algorithm would imply BQP lies in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP. However, the theorem’s statement does not explicitly mention any complexity-theoretic assumption, leaving the claim misleading in the standard (unrelativized) world where no such containment is known. Furthermore, while the authors refer to oracle separations between BQP and PH, their proof relies instead on the assumption BQP not in HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP, which is a heuristic class not known to be contained in PH and about which relatively little is understood. Clarifying these assumptions and aligning the theorem statements accordingly would significantly improve the precision and correctness of the presentation.

### Questions
Do we have any known separation between HeurBPP^NP^NP^NP and BQP, or we just believe in this separation intuitively?

### Summary
This paper studies quantum-classical separation for the identification problem. Learning advantages for quantum functions are shown under complexity-theoretic assumptions. This is a problem in the context of PAC in learning theory, where the objective of the learner is to identify if a given labeled dataset is predictable with any member of a concept class of functions. 

The authors prove a series of interesting results, for instance, showing that quantum functions are not randomly generable unless BQP is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

### Strengths
Overall, this is a solid paper studying an interesting problem regarding the quantum-classical separation under a complexity theoretic framework.
The authors establish a set of theoretical conditions under which such separation arises in learning problems, offering a solid foundation for understanding the boundaries between classical and quantum computational capabilities. In addition, the paper explores a few relevant applications where quantum-classical separation may manifest, providing practical contexts that highlight the significance of the results.

### Weaknesses
While the paper presents strong theoretical contributions, its accessibility may be limited due to its specialized focus and technical depth. The exposition appears tailored primarily for experts in quantum computing and theoretical learning, which could pose challenges for the broader ICLR audience. To enhance its impact and reach, the paper would benefit from revisions that clarify key concepts, provide more intuitive explanations, and better contextualize the results within mainstream machine learning frameworks.

### Questions
Can elaborate on how your results can contribute to classical quantum separation in the context of the PAC learning framework?
