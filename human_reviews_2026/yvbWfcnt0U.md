# Max-Min Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 8, 4, 4

## Abstract
The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing objects across different metric spaces, but its high computational complexity limits its applicability. Although the Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) discrepancy addresses this issue by projecting onto 1D distributions, it sacrifices key isometric properties, such as reflection and rotation invariance. In this work, we introduce the max-min Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (MSGW), a new variant that preserves the computational efficiency of SGW while ensuring essential isometric properties. This method can be viewed as an adversarial game and is closely tied to the Hausdorff distance. Empirical results demonstrate that MSGW achieves competitive performance with a limited number of projections and excels in scenarios with varying dimensions, making it a practical and robust alternative to existing
methods.

### Summary
The paper presents a max–min formulation of a sliced Gromov–Wasserstein (SGW) variant that aims to avoid optimization on the Stiefel manifold while (theoretically) preserving rotational-invariance properties, and more importantly isometric invariance properties. The idea is to use a max-min formulation and to optimize only over directions in the hypersphere.

### Strengths
The manuscript contains several interesting contributions: the metric property stated in Theorem 3.4 is notable, since prior work only established a one-directional result for the basic SGW; and the connection to the Hausdorff distance between projected measures (Theorem 3.6) is also interesting. Moreover, the definition of MSGW itself is sound and quite elegant, as it theoretically preserves all the desirable properties of the original Gromov–Wasserstein (GW) formulation while avoiding optimization on the Stiefel manifold.
The literature review is thorough, and the paper is generally well written.

### Weaknesses
Despite these strengths, the paper based itself on a false premise. The authors rely on a closed-form expression for one-dimensional Gromov problems; however, recent work (acknowledged in [1]) shows that this closed form is incorrect — there is no general sorting algorithm that solves the 1-D Gromov problem. What the manuscript actually computes is therefore not the true GW distance but a related divergence that essentially evaluates the GW loss on either the identity or anti-identity permutation. Appendix B tells that these two permutations commonly appear in practice, but this empirical claim is not supported by a theoretical statement. The paper should explicitly acknowledge at the beginning that the computed quantity is a different divergence, and clarify its interest (see below).

Another concern relates to the novelty of the paper. Although the proposed formulation is interesting, it remains overall rather incremental compared to [1]. This issue is most apparent in the experimental section, which exactly reproduces the same setups and results as in [1], providing very little additional insight or validation.
I believe that including a comparison with the sliced Wasserstein distance could significantly strengthen the experimental part. One could define an analogous metric by replacing GW with W in the formulation, which would help clarify the true added value of this approach. Positioning the proposed method relative to sliced Wasserstein would better highlight the practical and conceptual interest of building a “sliced” metric based on an approximation of GW (using the identity or anti-identity permutation).

Finally a last concern is algorithmic and numerical: MSGW is formulated as a max–min problem, unlike RISGW. Max–min problems are notoriously difficult to optimize in practice, and the paper does not discuss optimization stability or convergence. Convergence curves, sensitivity to initialization, and practical runtime/iteration counts would be important to assess optimization behavior and the claimed benefits of avoiding the Stiefel manifold.

### Questions
Appart from the previous remarks I have technical concerns about the argument in Appendix C.2.1 that GW = 0 implies MSGW = 0. The proof appeals to the claim that a measure-preserving isometry is linear and bijective and thus represented by an orthogonal matrix. I believe that this seems to implicitly invoke results like the Mazur–Ulam theorem, which require hypotheses: in particular, one typically needs Euclidean metrics on both spaces for GW, and Mazur–Ulam gives that surjective isometries between normed vector spaces are affine not linear, so one must ensure the map sends 0 to 0 to conclude linearity.
More importantly, the argument should check issues about supports of the measures: I believe Mazur–Ulam works between spaces that are vector spaces. So in this case, in order to work, I believe the support of the measures should be the entire space $\mathbb{R}^p$ (which is not the case for discrete measures). I suggest the authors (i) make the exact assumptions explicit, (ii) cite the appropriate functional-analytic result because I could not find (Berger, 2009, Theorem 9.1.3) (I belive it is like Mazur–Ulam) and state whether they require the map to be affine or linear, and (iii) discuss any needed assumptions on supports of the measures.

Minor remark: stating “GW is $O(n^3)$” is misleading. The GW problem is NP-hard in general; the cubic runtime refers to a particular algorithmic routine (e.g., a cubic implementation of the GW solver per iteration) rather than complexity of solving GW exactly.

### Summary
This paper introduces the max-min Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (MSGW) discrepancy as a computationally efficient surrogate for the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. It overcomes limitations of previous sliced GW methods, which are either computationally expensive or sacrifice rotational and reflection invariance.

### Strengths
- The novelty is simple yet clever, and well explained (even with the aid of a figure): there is no need to embed the measures into a common space (as for RISGW), since different projections are used. Thus, the idea aligns more naturally with the fundamentals of GW and is well-suited for future generalizations beyond measures supported on Euclidean spaces.

- Theoretical results are clearly presented. They study important properties of the methodology, including the metric property, the relation with the Hausdorff distance, and the error incurred by finite sample approximations.

- Several well-designed experiments demonstrate the rotation and reflection invariance of MSGW, its efficiency compared with existing GW variants, and its performance as a loss function in the generator of a GAN architecture. In addition, sensitivity analyses under different numbers of slices and noisy data are provided, showing both error control (utilizing theoretical error bounds) and robustness.

### Weaknesses
(a) Assumptions 3.3 for Theorem 3.4 are rather strong:

1 - The measures must be essentially supported on the same ambient space. This undermines the fundamentals of GW, where the ambient space should not matter. Moreover, under this assumption no embedding $\Delta$ is required.

2 - The measures must be empirical with the same number of points.

(b) The main text would benefit from including short sketches of the proofs of the main results (theorems and propositions).

### Questions
- Table 1, row 1: How is the $\mathcal O(n^3)$ complexity calculated? Solvers for GW usually achieve $\mathcal O(n^4)$; see, for example, Kerdoncuff et al., Sampled Gromov-Wasserstein. I would also suggest adding the regularized version of GW (entropic GW) to such table, since it is later used in the experiments section.
- The cited paper by Vayer et al. on SGW contains an error acknowledged by those authors in a revised version. Is this what the authors of this manuscript intended to refer to in line 171?
- What can the authors say about translation invariance?
- Can the authors comment on a possible dynamical framework as a byproduct of their work, if any?
- Why is RISGW not included in Figures 6 and 7?
- Is there any theoretical evidence connecting MSGW and GW, such as equivalence results or bounds?

Typos and stylistic issues:
- Revise quotation mark symbols.
- Footnote 3 lacks a period.
- Revise punctuation in line 353.

### Summary
Problem: Comparing data that live in different metric spaces is expensive with the Gromov–Wasserstein (GW) distance (non-convex). Existing sliced approximations speed things up but either lose rotation/reflection invariance (SGW) or become computationally costly/unstable when they try to restore it.

Motivation: Keep the speed of slicing while preserving the isometric properties of the original GW, and avoid the high-dimensional Stiefel-manifold optimization used by RISGW.

Contributions: (1) Propose Max–min slicing game: For each projection of one distribution, choose the “best” projection of the other to minimize 1D GW; then take the worst case over directions, and symmetrize. This yields a rotation/reflection-invariant sliced discrepancy. (2) Under standard discrete, uniform conditions, MSGW is a metric up to measure-preserving isometries (same as GW). In general it is a pseudo-metric. (3) Computation: Use a finite set of directions and evaluate all pairs (LxL) of 1D GW problems. Complexity is O(L^2 n log n) (slightly above SGW’s O(L n log n), far below RISGW). An error bound quantifies the approximation from finite projections.

Experiments are simple, not much practical.

### Strengths
- It aims for SGW-like cost while avoiding the expensive Stiefel-manifold optimization of RISGW; experiments show modest runtime vs RISGW and that entropic GW can hit memory limits.
- The adversarial slicing game is conceptually simple: minimize 1D GW for paired projections and then take the worst case; this is what yields the invariance while staying efficient.
- The paper proves MSGW preserves GW’s metric properties (up to measure-preserving isometries) and gives a finite-projection error bound; it also interprets MSGW as a pseudo Hausdorff distance between sets of 1D projections.
- To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first sliced GW that keeps rotation/reflection invariance while remaining computationally efficient.

### Weaknesses
- Assumption-heavy theory. Metric guarantees (“MSGW is a metric up to measure-preserving isometries”) rely on Assumption 3.3 and specific conditions; outside these, the distance is only a pseudo-metric.
- The experimental setting is poor. I don't understand why the authors try to test the method on GAN experiment. What are the reasons/motivations of experimenting the new method on GAN?
- Limited empirical scope. Experiments focus on spiral point clouds, a horse-mesh dataset, and a GAN toy setup; there’s no large-scale real-world benchmark to test scalability or downstream tasks.

### Questions
- What is the motivation for evaluating MSGW specifically in a GAN setup? Which property of MSGW (e.g., rotation/reflection invariance, noise robustness) is the GAN test meant to stress?

- Please provide quantitative GAN results for the MSGW-loss experiment, not just loss value. Report across several L values and random seeds.

- Can you add a large-scale, real-world benchmark (e.g., point-cloud registration on ModelNet/ShapeNet) to test scalability and downstream accuracy?

- The experiments are somewhat limited. Can you think of other useful downstream tasks and provide it?

### Summary
**Summary**  
This paper proposes the **Max–Min Sliced Gromov–Wasserstein (MSGW)** distance, a new sliced approximation to the GW distance that is both **rotation/reflection invariant** and **computationally efficient**. The method introduces a **max–min formulation** over two different projection directions. 

By allowing different projection directions for the two measures, MSGW restores the isometric invariance lost in standard Sliced GW (SGW) while avoiding the high cost of Rotation-Invariant SGW (RISGW). The overall complexity is $O(L^2 n \log n)$, and the distance can be interpreted as a Hausdorff metric between sets of 1D GW projections. Experiments show that MSGW achieves rotation-invariant, stable performance and compares favorably with SGW and RISGW in both accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths
Strengths
The paper introduces a novel and well-justified formulation, Max–Min Sliced Gromov–Wasserstein (MSGW), which effectively resolves the long-standing limitation of rotation and reflection sensitivity in sliced GW methods. The proposed max–min structure allows the two measures to project onto different directions, achieving isometric invariance while maintaining linear-time complexity in each 1D GW computation. This formulation is theoretically elegant, connecting MSGW to the Hausdorff distance over sets of one-dimensional GW projections. The paper provides solid analytical results, including invariance proofs and conditions under which MSGW coincides with GW, offering a clear theoretical foundation.

Empirically, the experiments demonstrate that MSGW achieves the intended invariance and stability without the heavy optimization cost of RISGW. On both synthetic and geometric datasets, MSGW consistently outperforms SGW in robustness to rotations, reflections, and noise, while remaining computationally efficient. The results confirm that MSGW is a practical and theoretically principled alternative to existing sliced GW variants, with strong potential for downstream applications in shape matching and generative modeling.

### Weaknesses
Theoretical Weakness
In Remark 4.1 and Appendix B, the authors claim that the 1D GW problem can be solved in $O(n \log n)$ time by sorting or anti-sorting the projected points. However, this statement is not theoretically valid in general. The assumption that sorting provides the exact optimizer holds only in very specific cases and lacks general proof. In fact, it has been shown that 1D GW does not admit a closed-form solution based solely on sorting. Counterexamples have been rigorously presented in “On Assignment Problems Related to Gromov–Wasserstein Distances on the Real Line”, demonstrating that the optimal permutation can differ from both the identity and reverse mappings. Moreover, even the original Sliced Gromov–Wasserstein paper (Vayer et al., 2019) — cited in this work — later acknowledged that its main theorem supporting this property was disproved.

Therefore, the reliance on sorting or anti-sorting as an “exact” solver for 1D GW introduces a significant theoretical inconsistency. While it may work as a practical heuristic, presenting it as an exact and universally efficient solution undermines the rigor of the proposed complexity analysis and the claimed $O(n \log n)$ efficiency. The paper would be stronger if it explicitly discussed this limitation and clarified whether MSGW’s theoretical properties still hold when the 1D subproblems are only approximately solved.

- Lack of approximation error analysis. 
The paper introduces a finite-direction approximation of MSGW but does not provide a clear analysis of how the approximation behaves as the number of sampled directions $L$ varies. In theory, MSGW replaces continuous optimization over the unit sphere with discrete sets of directions $(\Theta, \Phi)$, but the paper does not quantify the rate of convergence or the sensitivity of MSGW to the number of sampled directions. This is particularly relevant in high-dimensional settings, where the number of directions required for a stable estimate can grow rapidly, potentially offsetting the claimed computational benefits.

Empirically, no ablation studies are provided to show how the choice of $L$ affects accuracy, invariance quality, or runtime. Without such analysis, it is difficult to assess the robustness of MSGW under realistic computational constraints. A more systematic investigation of how direction sampling impacts performance would make the method’s practical reliability much clearer.

### Questions
- How sensitive is MSGW to the number of sampled projection directions $L$ in practice? It would be useful to see ablation experiments showing how varying $L$ affects both computational cost and accuracy, especially in higher dimensions.

- The experiments mainly involve 2D synthetic and shape-matching tasks. Have the authors tested MSGW on more complex or higher-dimensional datasets (e.g., point clouds or graph domains) to evaluate its scalability and robustness in realistic scenarios?

Other comments: 
Theorem 3.2 claims MSGW is pseudo-metric. In my opition, the author can claim it is a metric in a quotient space G/\sim, where  G  is the set of all mm-spaces with probability measure, \sim is the  equivlent relation defined by GW(X,Y)=0. 
In Theorem 3.4 the authors prove MSGW=0 implies GW=0. Thus, MSGW can be treated as metric (where identity is defined by \sim ).
