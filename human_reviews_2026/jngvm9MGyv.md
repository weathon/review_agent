## Abstract
Resource allocation (RA) is critical to efficient service deployment in Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a transformative networking paradigm. This task is termed NFV-RA. Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing promising potential to address this combinatorial complexity of constrained cross-graph mapping. However, RL-driven NFV-RA research lacks a systematic benchmark for comprehensive simulation and rigorous evaluation. This gap hinders in-depth performance analysis and slows algorithm development for emerging networks, resulting in fragmented assessments. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to accelerate the research and application of deep RL for NFV-RA. Virne provides customizable simulations for diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that integrates over 30 methods of various types. Virne also establishes a rigorous evaluation protocol that extends beyond online effectiveness to include practical perspectives such as solvability, generalizability, and scalability. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions. Overall, with its capabilities of diverse simulations, rich implementations, and thorough evaluation, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications. The code and resources are available at https://github.com/GeminiLight/virne.

### Summary
The paper introduces Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate RL-based Network Function Virtualization (NFV) Resource Allocation (RA) algorithms. Virne aims to bridge the gap in current NFV-RA evaluations, which lack comprehensive, standardized benchmarking methods. It provides highly customizable simulations for diverse network environments (e.g., cloud, edge, 5G), incorporating over 30 algorithms, including both traditional and RL-based approaches.

### Strengths
1. The Virne framework is a significant contribution to the field, addressing the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for RL-based NFV-RA solutions.
2. Virne is highly customizable, allowing users to simulate different network topologies, resource availability, and service requirements. This versatility enables testing across various real-world conditions, including energy-efficient, latency-sensitive, and resource-heterogeneous networks.
3. The paper provides extensive experimental results, evaluating over 30 different NFV-RA algorithms across multiple topologies and network conditions.

### Weaknesses
1. More emphasis on real-world network scenarios (such as live 5G networks or dynamic, large-scale production environments) could further strengthen the validity and practical applicability of the framework.
2. The NFV-RA problem often involves strict resource constraints (e.g., computing power, bandwidth, latency, etc.). RL agents may face challenges when dealing with these constraints, especially as the network scale increases, causing the solution space to grow rapidly and leading to inefficiencies in the agent's learning of optimal strategies. It is recommended to introduce a detailed discussion on handling constraints: further analysis and discussion on how to manage these complex resource constraints during the RL training process.
3. It is worth discussing how to enhance the agent's transferability across multiple NFV-RA tasks through a multi-task MDP framework or meta-learning. For example, does the Virne framework support training a general strategy across different network environments and evaluate its generalization ability in new environments?

### Summary
This paper presents VIRNE, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for reinforcement learning-based network function virtualization resource allocation (NFV-RA). The framework unifies diverse simulation environments (cloud, edge, 5G), integrates over 30 algorithms (including RL, heuristic, and exact solvers), and introduces new evaluation perspectives such as solvability, generalization, and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that advanced RL agents (especially dual GNN-based PPO variants) outperform traditional baselines. The benchmark is open-sourced to promote reproducibility and standardization in the NFV-RA community. Overall, the work provides strong engineering value and community impact but offers limited methodological novelty.

### Strengths
+ VIRNE represents the most systematic and extensive benchmark for NFV-RA to date. It consolidates numerous algorithms, diverse simulation environments, and multiple evaluation perspectives into a unified, open, and reproducible framework. This kind of infrastructure contribution fills a long-standing need in the NFV and RL communities.
+ The modular design, well-documented implementation, and thorough experimental setup reflect a high level of technical maturity. The open-source release with detailed appendices ensures reproducibility, aligning with ICLR’s best practices.
+ The experiments cover diverse network scenarios, real-world topologies, and multiple metrics beyond traditional performance, offering a valuable empirical reference for future work.
+ The paper is well-structured and logically consistent. Figures and tables are well-presented, helping readers understand the system architecture and experimental findings.

### Weaknesses
- The paper’s contribution is primarily infrastructural rather than algorithmic. The RL formulations (e.g., MDP setup, PPO training, GNN encoders) follow standard designs without introducing new theoretical insights or model innovations.
- While experiments are comprehensive, most results are reported as single averages without statistical significance tests or error margins. This weakens the strength of empirical claims.
- Several sections (notably Sections 3–4) emphasize implementation details at the expense of high-level conceptual insights. The paper reads more like a system report than a research contribution.
- Terms like solvability, generalization, and scalability are described qualitatively but lack formal or quantitative definitions, limiting their interpretability and comparability.

### Questions
How are the “solvability,” “generalization,” and “scalability” metrics formally defined and measured? Are they normalized or directly comparable across different network topologies?

Are the results averaged over multiple runs or random seeds? If not, could the authors report standard deviations or confidence intervals to support claims of superiority?

Can the proposed benchmark be easily extended to other RL-based network optimization problems (e.g., SDN routing, SFC placement)?

What are the main limitations of VIRNE when applied to real-world NFV systems — for example, partial observability, dynamic resource noise, or latency constraints?

Beyond engineering value, is there a potential direction for new algorithmic or theoretical insights enabled by this benchmark (e.g., constrained or meta-RL for NFV-RA)?

### Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for resource allocation (RA) in Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It enables a modular, standardized, and customizable pipeline for the implementation of reinforcement learning (RL)-based NFV-RA methods, and offers an in-depth analysis of the design principles behind different RL components. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the performance, solvability, scalability, and generalization of these methods.

### Strengths
The paper decomposes the implementation of RL into three parts, the RL algorithm, the neural network architecture, and the implementation techniques, and provides multiple design options for each component to investigate their underlying design principles, offering valuable insights into the application of RL in NFV-RA.

The benchmarking framework proposed in the paper provides a comprehensive platform that includes diverse NFV application scenarios, implementations of over 30 RA algorithms, and supports the evaluation of a wide range of research metrics.

### Weaknesses
Considering that this is a unified benchmarking framework, assuming a one-to-one mapping from virtual networks to physical networks in the system model seems unreasonable. In general, multiple virtual nodes should be allowed to map to the same physical node to enable flexible deployment.

There is a lack of research on emerging network architectures, such as Transformers and diffusion models.

The paper repeatedly selects virtual nodes from the virtual network and maps them onto the physical network using a RA policy, then applies a shortest-path algorithm to determine the deployment of virtual links and identify feasible embedding solutions. However, the paper lacks an explanation of the selection order of virtual nodes.

The mathematical formulation of the system model in Appendix A has some issues, for example, 
	n_p  may be N_p in Constraint 1;
	If the directionality of path mapping is not considered, the left-hand side of Constraint 5 will always be zero.
Please check it carefully.

### Summary
This paper introduces Virne, a benchmark designed to accelerate research and application of deep RL for network resource allocation in NFV. The authors address a critical gap in the field by providing a unified, modular, and extensible framework that supports diverse network scenarios (e.g., cloud, edge, and 5G), integrates over 30 algorithms (including traditional and RL-based methods), and evaluates them with rigorous metrics such as solvability, generalizability, and scalability. Through experiments, the authors provide insights for future research directions.

### Strengths
a) The Virne framework supports a wide variety of network scenarios and resource types, including heterogeneous resources and latency-sensitive environments.

b) The authors conduct experiments across diverse topologies (e.g., Waxman, GEANT, BRAIN) and network scales, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms.

### Weaknesses
a) The authors use a fixed 50% random probability for interconnections between virtual nodes. A fixed interconnection probability may not accurately reflect real-world VN topologies, which often exhibit more structured (sequential or hierarchical) connectivity patterns. To better align with real-world NFV scenarios, the authors should consider adopting more dynamic and realistic VN topology generation methods (e.g., using real-world datasets).

b) The computing and bandwidth resource configurations in physical and virtual networks are modeled using uniform distributions, which may oversimplify real-world resource dynamics. Actual NFV systems often have more complex, non-uniform resource distributions influenced by hardware constraints and workload patterns.

c) The abstract lacks clarity and precision. The abstract includes terms and phrases that are not clearly defined, which may confuse readers. For example, the abstract mentions "this complexity" without explicitly explaining what aspect of complexity it refers to. Similarly, "the field" does not specify whether it refers to NFV or RL research. Also, key terms such as "NFV-RA" are not clearly defined in the abstract.

d) Given the rapid development of NFV, some relevant literatures are necessary to be compared in the context of related work, e.g., NFVdeep: Adaptive Online Service Function Chain Deployment with Deep Reinforcement Learning, iwqos’19; Adaptive VNF Scaling and Flow Routing with Proactive Demand Prediction, infocom’18, etc.
