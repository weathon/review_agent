## Abstract
Federated graph learning (FGL) has rapidly gained prominence as a privacy-preserving collaborative paradigm. However, the increasing prevalence of backdoor attacks presents significant challenges to federated systems. These attacks rely on the injection of carefully crafted triggers that lead to erroneous predictions. Recent research has shown that the diversity of trigger structures and injection locations in FGL diminishes the effectiveness of traditional federated defense methods. Notably, existing defense strategies for FGL have yet to fully exploit the unique topological structures of graphs, highlighting opportunities for improvement in countering these attacks.

To this end, we propose a tailored topology- and distribution-aware backdoor defense against federated graph learning method (FedTD). At the client level, we introduce an energy function to integrate the underlying data distribution into the local model, assigning low energy to benign clients and high energy to malicious clients. By combining topological features with the energy function, we establish a more comprehensive energy estimation. At the server level, we construct a virtual graph based on estimation of each client to evaluate the maliciousness score of each client. The homophily level of each local graph is considered to ensure the reliability of the virtual graph. During aggregation, we assign lower weights to clients with high malicious scores and higher weights to clients with low malicious scores, thus achieving a more robust FGL. FedTD remains robust under both small and large malicious client ratios. Extensive results across various federated graph scenarios under backdoor attacks validate the effectiveness of FedTD.

### Summary
The paper presents FedTD , a new robust defense mechanism to counter backdoor attacks in Federated Graph Learning (FGL). Unlike other defenses which the authors describe as 'topology blind’, and as ignoring under and over graph homophily levels across clients, FedTD manages this at the client (TDCE) level by having each client create a fully summarized estimation vector that makes a weighted combination of its data distribution (modeled with an energy-based GCN) and topological features (node degree and centrality). Server side (TDGC) also provides a ‘virtual client graph’ by clustering estimation vectors based on cosine similarity. 
The authors’ main contribution on this is the adjustment of similarity score with client homophily levels, which gives a reliable anomalous behavior score. In the virtual graph, malicious clients are identified as low degree outliers, and are given lower weights during model aggregation, nullifying the attack. FedTD under these conditions on five datasets, with small stealthy triggers and varying malicious clients ratios has shown to significantly outperform 14 baselines.  Robustness to hyper-parameters has been shown and the proposed topological features in conjunction with distributional energy and energy shift loss homophily adjustment showed the necessity of each component in ablation studies.

### Strengths
- A homophily aware virtual client graph coupled with a topology augmented energy based client estimator (TDCE+TDGC) integrates structure and distribution in a manner not seen in previous defenses within the federated graph learning (FGL) space, like FedTGE. 

- Extensive experimentation across five disparate datasets under both IID/Non IID Louvain configurations and varying malicious client ratios demonstrates significant and consistent improvements relative to strong federated learning and federated graph learning baselines, which is further substantiated through ablation studies, convergence training curves, and hyperparameter optimization.  

- It uniquely considers backdoor defenses within federated node classification, a significant, under covered threat paradigm to which both topology and homophily are critical, which underpins its applicability to resilient, distributed GNNs.

- The method's lightweight constituents (classical graph topology features, single hidden layer MLP, degree based weighting, N=1 perturbation) imply minimal operational burden and ease of adoption into current federated graph learning workflows.

### Weaknesses
-	While the paper claims to be the first integration of topology and distribution for robust FGL, topology aware aggregation and other related FGL works exist (though not for backdoor defense). 

-	The paper grids over R and $\tau$ but it’s unclear whether the competing methods receive the same level of tuning or recommended parameters from their works. Furthermore, all experiments utilize a 2 layer GCN for node classification; it’s unclear if GAT/GraphSAGE/heterophily oriented GNNs or other tasks would yield consistency in the gains reported.

-	The formulation explicitly enforces $V=⋃_kV_k$ with $V_i∩V_j=\phi$, ignoring cross-client edges/overlaps common in practical FGL; the paper does not discuss how FedTD would handle inter-client connectivity.

-	The document keeps mentioning a “comprehensive metric B” along with accuracy (A) and backdoor failure rate R without discussing how B is calculated (weighted average, harmonic mean, etc.). This makes it hard to interpret and reproduce.

-	The evaluation considers fixed, randomly placed, size-4 triggers and only changes trigger type and the malicious-client ratio. There is no counter evidence against adversaries who adapt to FedTD signals (e.g., topology-mimicking or homophily-aware triggers), leaving the proof of robustness against stronger attacks unverified.

-	While the method touches on efficiency options, such as using a single-layer MLP for the estimator, it still lacks reported timing and communication costs, as well as scalability studies (clients × graph size), and therefore the deployment cost-benefit remains ambiguous.

### Questions
1.	Solve the points hightlighted in weaknesses
	
2. The experiments appear to use full participation each round with fixed K, yet in practice, FL frequently utilizes partial participation and suffers client churn. What happens with FedTD when some clients only partially attend a few rounds, or when a few clients who are active in some rounds changes continuously? Please include results that demonstrate varying participation rate (e.g., 10/30/50%) and number of clients K and also describe the stability of the virtual graph (edge density/connected components) over rounds in the situations described.

3. Section 3.2 introduces the energy shift loss $L_{ESC}$ with gradients $\nabla_{v_i} S(v_i)$ while Perturb(⋅) includes discrete edge add/remove operations (Eq. 3–4). Please clarify: (i) what variables the gradient is actually taken with respect to (node features only, logits, or a relaxed adjacency); (ii) the full training objective (is cross entropy combined with $L_{ESC}$? with what weight $\lambda$?). A short pseudocode snippet plus a wall time/overhead table would make the method much easier to reproduce and reason about.

### Summary
The manuscript introduces a topology- and distribution-aware backdoor defense framework FedTD, which integrates topological information and data distribution characteristics to enhance both client- and server-level robustness. At the client level, an energy-based modeling mechanism assigns low energy values to benign clients and high energy values to malicious ones by jointly capturing structural and distributional features. At the server level, a virtual graph is constructed to estimate the maliciousness score of each client while considering homophily levels to ensure the reliability of topological assessment. During aggregation, clients with higher malicious scores are assigned smaller weights, thereby suppressing poisoned updates and improving model resilience. Extensive experiments across diverse FGL scenarios demonstrate that FedTD maintains strong defense capability even under high ratios of compromised clients.

### Strengths
This manuscript presents a novel and well-motivated contribution to the filed of FGL. It effectively combines graph topology and data distribution information through two complementary modules TDCE and TDGC. This dual-level design introduces a principled mechanism for distinguishing benign from malicious clients.

Methodologically, this manuscript is technically sound and clearly articulated. It provides formal definitions, derivations, and algorithmic explanations of the energy-based modeling and homophily-aware similarity estimation. The inclusion of homophily level adjustments is particularly insightful, as it captures structural diversity inherent to federated graph settings.

The authors benchmark FedTD against a wide range of baselines, including classical FL defenses and FGL-specific methods, across five datasets under both IID and Non-IID-Louvain settings. Results consistently demonstrate that FedTD outperforms competitors in both accuracy and backdoor resistance, showing robustness across varying malicious client ratios and trigger types. Ablation studies and hyperparameter analyses further confirm the contribution of each component, enhancing the paper’s empirical credibility.

### Weaknesses
While the methodology is conceptually strong, the theoretical foundation of the proposed energy-based estimation and the connection between energy distribution and malicious behavior remain largely empirical. The paper does not provide formal guarantees or analytical insights into why the proposed energy–topology fusion should generalize across heterogeneous graph distributions.

The computational and communication overhead introduced by constructing and maintaining the virtual client graph and computing homophily-aware similarities is not analyzed in detail. For large-scale FGL scenarios with numerous clients, the scalability and real-time feasibility of FedTD may be a concern. Additionally, the sensitivity to hyperparameters (e.g., threshold $\tau$, energy perturbation strength, temperature $\gamma$) is only briefly discussed without exploring stability across different environments.

While the experiments cover multiple datasets, they focus solely on node classification. The generality of FedTD to other FGL tasks (e.g., link prediction, graph classification) remains untested. The attack baselines also primarily rely on traditional trigger designs, without evaluating against adaptive or dynamic backdoor strategies, which could better test the method’s robustness.

The paper’s related work discussion, though broad, lacks deeper contrast with recent graph-specific robust learning frameworks (e.g., defense via certified aggregation or representation smoothing). This limits the clarity of FedTD’s position within the broader robustness landscape.

### Summary
This paper proposes FedTD, a defense method against backdoor attacks in federated graph learning. It combines graph topology, data distribution, and homophily information to detect malicious clients and reduce their impact during aggregation. Experiments show that FedTD outperforms existing methods under various datasets and attack scenarios

### Strengths
1. The paper clearly points out two major limitations of existing FGL defenses—neglecting topology and homophily differences—with a clear research motivation. 

2. The experiments are extensive, covering both IID and Non-IID settings, and comparing with 14 SOTA methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks a clear threat model. It is recommended that the authors provide a detailed description of this part.

2.  The authors could include models other than GCN for comparison to demonstrate the generality of the proposed defense across different architectures.

3. In the main text, the defense is evaluated against random backdoor attacks rather than SOTA ones, which does not fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is recommended that the authors test against more advanced backdoor attacks such as Opt-GDBA [Yang et al' 2024].

4. Although efficiency is emphasized, the paper does not provide concrete comparisons of FedTD with baseline methods in terms of computation time or communication cost.

### Questions
It is unclear how metric B is calculated; some implementation details should be provided.

### Summary
This paper proposes FedTD, a novel topology- and distribution-aware defense framework against backdoor attacks in Federated Graph Learning (FGL). To effectively identify malicious clients, FedTD introduces a client-side estimation module that jointly leverages data distribution and five complementary topological features to capture structural signatures of backdoor triggers and enhance robustness across diverse attack patterns. At the server level, FedTD constructs a virtual client graph that explicitly accounts for varying homophily levels across local graphs, enabling more reliable similarity measurement and maliciousness scoring. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets under both IID and Non-IID settings demonstrate that FedTD significantly outperforms existing baselines, validating the effectiveness of its integrated design.

### Strengths
1. The propsoed method integrates five complementary topological features like node degree, PageRank, clustering coefficient into client estimation to capture structural signatures of backdoor triggers and enhancing robustness against diverse attack patterns.
2. The method  proposes the topology and distribution aware graph construction to address the limitation of existing approaches, which fail to account for the varying homophily levels across clients.
3. The effectiveness of the proposed module is validated on both real-world and synthetic graph datasets.

### Weaknesses
1.	The threshold τ is crucial for constructing the virtual graph and the paper lacks analysis of the choice of τ  in methods and experiments.
2.	The methodology section introduces several design choices like constructing virtual graphs and selecting five specific topological features, however, the paper lacks a complexity analysis of the proposed method.
3.	The experiment lacks a comparative analysis of running efficiency between the proposed method and the baselines.
4.	Although the paper provides an anonymous code link, the corresponding files are missing.

### Questions
1. The structural information aware is crucial to the proposed method. However, the paper lacks detailed explanation and justification regarding why  "Node Degree, Local Clustering Coefficient, Degree Centrality, PageRank Score, and Standard Deviation of Neighbor Degrees" can help "mitigate the potential noise." or further clarify why these particular features were chosen as structural-aware descriptors?
2. Could the proposed method be compared with more recent baseline methods?
