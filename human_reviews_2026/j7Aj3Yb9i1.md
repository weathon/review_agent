- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 4, 4

## Abstract
Time series foundation models (TSFMs) require diverse, real-world datasets to adapt across varying domains and temporal frequencies. However, current large-scale datasets predominantly focus on low-frequency time series with sampling intervals, i.e., time resolution, in the range of seconds to years, hindering their ability to capture the nuances of high-frequency time series data. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dataset that captures millisecond-resolution wireless and traffic conditions from an operational 5G wireless deployment, expanding the scope of TSFMs to incorporate high-frequency data for pre-training. Further, the dataset introduces a new domain, wireless networks, thus complementing existing more general domains like energy and finance. The dataset also provides use cases for short-term forecasting, with prediction horizons spanning from 100 milliseconds (1 step) to 9.6 seconds (96 steps). By benchmarking traditional machine learning models and TSFMs on predictive tasks using this dataset, we demonstrate that TSFMs perform poorly on this new data distribution in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Our work underscores the importance of incorporating high-frequency datasets during pre-training and forecasting to enhance architectures, fine-tuning strategies, generalization, and robustness of TSFMs in real-world applications.

### Summary
This paper investigates the important challenge of adapting TSFMs to high-frequency data, a domain that is currently underrepresented in standard pre-training benchmarks. The authors introduce a new millisecond-resolution dataset from a 5G wireless network and benchmark several TSFMs and traditional models.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a new, real-world dataset with millisecond-level resolution, addressing a significant gap since most existing benchmarks focus on low-frequency data
2. It brings the domain of wireless networks (5G) into the scope of TSFM.
3. The study effectively demonstrates that current TSFMs perform poorly on this new high-frequency dataset.
While the direction of this work is commendable, I have several major concerns that prevent me from recommending acceptance at this time.

### Weaknesses
While the direction of this work is commendable, I have several major concerns that prevent me from recommending acceptance at this time.
1. the paper's scope and claims seem overstated. The title and introduction promise to "Bridge the High-Frequency Data Gap" , but the contribution is a single dataset from one specific domain (5G wireless networks). It is a significant leap to assume this one dataset can adequately represent the diverse challenges of all high-frequency data, which might include high-frequency finance, industrial sensor readings, or biometrics, each with unique properties. The authors should be more precise in their claims, positioning this as a valuable benchmark for high-frequency communication network data, rather than a general solution for the entire high-frequency gap.
2. I found a jarring inconsistency in the description of the experimental methodology. In Section 4, the authors state that the multivariate setting uses "four input features". However, the corresponding Table 2, which is supposed to list these features, only provides descriptions for three (CQI, MCS, and pkt ok/nok). Besides, 3/4 features for multivariate forecasting seems too few.
3. the figure quality looks poor, which should be improved.

### Summary
This paper introduces and analyzes a new millisecond-resolution time series dataset derived from a real-world operational 5G wireless network environment, focusing on wireless and traffic measurement data. Unlike existing large-scale time series foundation model (TSFM) benchmarks, which are dominated by low-frequency domains and traditional sources such as finance, energy, and general sensor data, this dataset captures high-frequency wireless conditions and supports short-term forecasting tasks, with horizons spanning from 100 milliseconds to nearly 10 seconds. The authors perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation using several shallow learning baselines (RF, XGBoost, ARF, Naive) and modern TSFMs (TTM, Chronos, Lag-Llama), assessing their performance on both univariate and multivariate tasks, and provide detailed analysis of the unique data characteristics involved. The key finding is that TSFMs, even after fine-tuning, perform poorly on this data compared to adaptive shallow learners, highlighting fundamental gaps in TSFM generalization to high-frequency, irregular environments.

### Strengths
**S1** The paper addresses a major gap in the current TSFM landscape by introducing a uniquely high-frequency (millisecond-level) real-world dataset from the wireless networking domain, as clearly contrasted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The data provides a new benchmark for both model development and evaluation.

**S2** Strong empirical analysis is presented demonstrating, with quantitative rigor (see Table 4, Table 5), that state-of-the-art TSFMs underperform relative to adaptive shallow learners, particularly ARF, in the irregular and bursty environment of 5G wireless bitrate prediction.

**S3** Figure 4 and the associated discussion show thorough exploration of the dataset’s temporal and statistical characteristics—decomposing trend, seasonality, residuals, stationarity, heavy-tailed behavior, and autocorrelation structure—a critical diagnostic for understanding challenges in model generalization.

### Weaknesses
**W1** Empirical Scope – Dataset Subset and Generalizability: While the raw dataset is described as highly diverse (various mobility and traffic patterns, including adversarial traffic), all primary experiments focus on a filtered subset (static mobility, benign video traffic). Results may thus lack generality for the broader dataset or for "active" network regimes expected in practice. See Section 3.2 and Section 4.3 for specifics. Although an ablation is provided in Appendix A.3, it is minor relative to the main paper’s claims and only briefly covers a single alternative pattern (train mobility, DoS-Hulk-C traffic class).

**W2** Limited TSFM Fine-tuning and Adaptation: The TSFM models are mainly used in zero-shot and vanilla fine-tuning modes, with little attention given to recent adaptation/transfer techniques (e.g., domain adaptation, LoRA, sophisticated feature engineering, deep calibration, or per-task tuning). While Limitations (Section 5) mention this, the omission is significant, especially since ARF’s advantage may partly stem from online adaptation absent in the TSFM attempts.

**W3** Baselines: Shallow models use modest hyperparameter tuning, and TSFM implementations are described as "default." More systematic and rigorous HPO or ensembling (which is routine for robust time series baselines) could potentially close some of the reported performance gap, as acknowledged in Section 5, raising questions about the finality of the reported results.

**W4** Metrics and Fairness of Comparison: Although considerable care goes into aligning horizon evaluation, there are differences in how the models exploit input features, prediction structure, and context. For example, Chronos is omitted from the multivariate analysis, potentially limiting the claim of absolute TSFM underperformance—the models may simply not be fully leveraged in this regime.

### Questions
**Q1** Can the authors provide a more thorough examination of why adaptive shallow methods (e.g., ARF) outperform TSFMs? Is the primary issue lack of high-frequency data in pre-training, or are the architectural/modeling choices themselves inadequate for volatility and concept drift?

**Q2** What experimental results, if any, are available for larger-scale TSFMs or multiscale/transfer models? Could these models narrow the observed gap with more targeted fine-tuning or adaptation?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new, real‑world, millisecond‑resolution time‑series dataset collected from a 5G Open RAN deployment with a focus on short-horizon forecasting. The authors benchmark traditional shallow models (RF, XGB, ARF) and several TSFMs (TTM, Chronos‑bolt‑small, Lag‑Llama) on univariate and multivariate forecasting of downlink bitrate, showing that an online/streaming approach outperforms both static shallow models and current TSFMs on this high‑frequency, spiky, non‑stationary data. The paper argues that existing TSFMs generalize poorly to this regime and calls for incorporating high‑frequency domains like wireless networking in pretraining corpora.

### Strengths
1. The figures contrasting timescales and domains make a strong case that current pretraining corpora underrepresent millisecond‑level data and the wireless domain
2. Measurements are from an operational O‑RAN (with near‑RT RIC) using USRPs and diverse mobility/traffic profiles, which increases ecological validity over synthetic lab traces.
3. The paper analyzes non‑stationarity, heavy tails, weak or absent seasonality and clustered extremes using STL/rolling stats/Q‑Q/SNR/ACF explaining why generic TSFMs struggle.

### Weaknesses
1. Chronos is evaluated only univariately (Section 4.1), while shallow models in multivariate mode leverage exogenous features
2. For Chronos, zero‑shot and fine‑tuned metrics are identical to four decimals (0.0313 MAE 0.0185). This is suspicious and suggests fine‑tuning may not have actually changed the model or was evaluated incorrectly.
3. For TTM, fine‑tuning is worse than zero‑shot in the multivariate setting (Table 4), which deserves diagnosis beyond claiming suboptimal.
4. Section 5 acknowledges minimal HPO for RF/XGB and default TSFM configs. Given the strong claim about “TSFMs perform poorly,” a modest, targeted sweep (e.g., context length, learning rate, adapter size) and a couple of online baselines (e.g., simple online linear/Kalman filters) would increase credibility
5. It’s unclear how train/val/test splitting is done (“80:20” is given, but is the split strictly temporal and by UE?). Seed control and repetition are not discussed; many ± values in Table 4 are 0.0000, suggesting a single deterministic run or missing variance estimation.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new high-frequency (millisecond-resolution) time series dataset collected from a real-world 5G Open RAN deployment, targeting a significant gap in existing time series foundation model (TSFM) resources. The dataset extends temporal coverage to very fine granularity and offers a benchmark scenario for short-term forecasting tasks relevant to wireless communication networks. The authors provide a detailed characterization of the dataset, positioning it against standard low-frequency TSFM benchmarks, and perform comparative evaluation of traditional shallow models and several prominent TSFMs. Results indicate substantial challenges for current TSFMs when applied to high-frequency wireless data, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned setups. The work highlights the need for broader data diversity—including high-frequency wireless contexts—in future TSFM research.

### Strengths
1. The presented dataset addresses a clear and important gap in the current TSFM ecosystem, focusing on an underrepresented, high-frequency (millisecond-resolution) regime that existing benchmarks neglect (see Figures 1, 2, and 3). The clear presentation of this gap is a notable strength.
2. The data collection methodology is well described, leveraging a fully operational 5G O-RAN setup with diverse traffic types and mobility patterns. This realism and diversity enhance potential research utility for modeling real-world dynamics.
3. Explicit quantitative and qualitative analyses (Table 4, Figure 5) convincingly show how existing TSFMs struggle with this form of data, particularly emphasizing weaknesses in handling abrupt shifts, volatility, and concept drift compared to dynamic shallow learners (e.g., ARF).

### Weaknesses
1. The analysis is largely focused on a filtered subset (static mobility + video streaming) of the wireless dataset for primary benchmarking (Section 3.2, Section 4). The multivariate scenario has only four features, and the diversity of forecasting settings is quite restricted. This sharply limits the generality of conclusions and prevents deeper insight into the strengths and limitations of models under wider operational variations (mobility, adversarial traffic). 
2. The fine-tuning protocol for TSFMs is only minimally described and does not explore more advanced adaptation mechanisms such as LoRA or domain-aware feature engineering, despite suggesting this in the limitations. Results in Table 4 may therefore understate TSFM potential. 
3. A critical flaw in the paper's experimental design is the incomplete evaluation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) in the multivariate forecasting scenario. The authors introduce a multivariate dataset, making multivariate prediction a core and essential application. However, in Table 4, the performance results for TSFMs in the multivariate setting are provided only for TTM, while the results for Chronos and Lag-Llama are conspicuously absent.

### Questions
1. Given the observed poor performance of TSFMs, to what extent do pretraining corpus choices (domain/frequency/resolution) dominate over architectural differences? Could the authors provide more nuanced ablation on TSFM pretraining regimes?
2. Were advanced TSFM fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, domain adaptation, feature normalization) attempted, and if so, with what result? If not, does the team plan to pursue these in future benchmarking?
3. Considering the analysis in Figures 6–10 of the appendix: Can the authors explicitly discuss what feature types (seasonality, volatility, autocorrelation) drive performance differences between models?
