## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced graph classification, yet they remain vulnerable to graph-level imbalance, encompassing class imbalance and topological imbalance. To address both types of imbalance in a unified manner, we propose UniImb, a Unified framework for Imbalanced graph classification. Specifically, UniImb first captures multi-scale topological features and enhances data diversity via learnable personalized graph perturbations. It then employs a dynamic balanced prototype module to learn representative prototypes from graph instances, improving the quality of graph representations. Concurrently, a prototype load-balancing optimization term mitigates dominance by majority samples to equalize sample influence during training. We justify these design choices theoretically using the Information Bottleneck principle. Extensive experiments on 19 datasets-including a large-scale imbalanced air pollution graph dataset AirGraph released by us and 23 baselines demonstrate that UniImb has achieved dominant performance across various imbalanced scenarios. Our code is available at GitHub.

### Summary
In this submission, a unified framework, UniImb, for handling both class imbalance and topological imbalance in graph classification tasks is prposed. The core innovation lies in the introduction of a dynamic balanced prototype module, coupled with a prototype load-balancing regularizer, which ensures equitable influence from tail graphs. Theoretically, the authors provide an information-theoretic justification for the prototype balancing mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck principle. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniImb achieves competitive performance.

### Strengths
S1. The authors are the first to unify the modeling of class imbalance and topological imbalance in graph classification, filling a notable gap in existing research. 

S2. The proposed dynamic prototype method is elegantly designed and well-grounded theoretically. And the proposed UniImb framework is highly versatile and plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into various GNN backbones. 

S3. Another key strength of this work is its exceptionally comprehensive and thorough experimental evaluation, encompassing 13 datasets, over 20 baselines, and the introduction of a new large-scale graph classification benchmark. Across all settings, UniImb delivers significant performance improvements.

### Weaknesses
W1. The model contains several key hyperparameters. Although the authors analyzed the sensitivity of each individually in the original paper, a sensitivity analysis of combinations of two hyperparameters is also necessary.

W2. While the overall framework is interesting, most individual components seems like incremental.

W3. All datasets are from common benchmarks. It would be stronger to include an industrial-scale or biomedical use case with real-world imbalance.

### Questions
Q1. What does "Basis" mean in Table 1?

Q2. What is the final form of the model's loss? How is the classification loss combined with Equation 11? 

Q3. Why do the authors claim that "Methods focused on topology imbalance adapting to small graphs but typically ignore imbalanced class distributions"? Why can't existing models handle these two types of imbalance effectively?

Q4. Imbalance learning baselines such as upsampling have only been evaluated on GNNs; can their effectiveness be extended or improved when applied to graph Transformers?

Minor errors:

(1) The red boxes in the article's appendix can be deleted; they seem to serve no purpose.

(2) The table caption content is overly redundant.

(3) Bold text in table captions should be used with caution.

### Summary
The paper presents a method for improvements in imbalance learning on graphs. Specifically, the problem is the graph classification setting that assumes the data can have both class and topological imbalance. The method contains multiple components, but the key innovations are the learned augmentations and dynamic prototypes. Across a large set of datasets the authors show significant improvements over prior work in this domain.

### Strengths
S1. The motivation for not applying graph augmentations/perturbations uniformly makes sense, which leads to their proposed personalized strategy to learn them based on the graph characteristics. 

S2. The dynamic balanced prototype strategy is interesting, having solid theoretical support, and appears to provide great empirical gains. 

S3. The level of detail in conducing such comprehensive experimental results is very appreciated and provides the community with rich results to further understand the present method beyond a typical work.

### Weaknesses
W1. Generally the problem of imbalance classification on graphs is interesting, but at this point in time there have been numerous works in this direction. Thus, although there is empirical performance gains, the problem itself is well established and the methodology is somewhat lacking key novelty by combining so many techniques in an attempt to obtain the highest performing method (as compared to just focusing on the core innovations of the work). 

For further less critical weaknesses, please see the comments and questions below.

### Questions
1. Was there any issue with running the TopoImb baseline? The results there look unreasonably low. 

2. Is it possible to compare against more recent methods, e.g., [1] or others that have shown performance gains over ImbGNN?

3. Although focused on graph-level tasks, providing a bit more related work on other imbalance problems could be beneficial (e.g., representative works in node, edge, and potentially subgraph), but the discussion in relation to the vision domain seems less relevant. 

4. Can you elaborate more on specifically why a contribution is unifying class and topological imbalance? Note that the prior work ImbGNN also discusses this innovation when building the connection between them. 

5. As compared to cherry picking the best result to make claims like "UniImb delivers up to 41.62% relative improvement on ..." providing averages across all datasets would be a preferred and less biased approach for the reader to consume the summarized information (note that already the average improvement is quite significant and need not just report the "up to" results here to show the empirical success/benefits of the proposed method).

6. The work "DPGNN: Dual-Perception Graph Neural Network for Representation Learning" is cited as providing a prototype based approach, but does not appear to present such method.  

7. Most of the datasets are binary classification and have overlapping domains. Are there datasets with more classes that could be explored (potentially diverse domains)? How would this prototype-based framework handle many classes? You may consider looking here [2]. 

Based on the response to the comments and questions above, I am open to revising my score.

### Summary
This paper addresses a comprehensive graph classification scenario involving both class imbalance and topological imbalance, and proposes a method named UniImb. Specifically, UniImb integrates multiple carefully designed techniques and introduces a prototype learning strategy to capture representative features, while a balancing constraint ensures its effectiveness in such imbalanced settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achives better results.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method to extracting prototype features is skillfully designed to address the challenge of graph imbalance. 
2. The experimental evaluation is convincing, demonstrating consistently performance gains over existing methods.
3. Mathematical notation is clearly defined and used consistently throughout the manuscript, which is overall well-structured and clearly written.

### Weaknesses
1. Adding an algorithm pseudocode box can more clearly show the technical details.
2. Why can't existing models comprehensively handle both types of imbalance? Although the authors provide an explanation in the introduction, a more intuitive clarification would be helpful.
3. The primary experimental results (Tables 1 and 2) evaluate these two problems in isolation. While Section 5.4 does introduce an "intertwined" scenario. This makes it difficult to assess the framework's synergistic advantages. The current evidence in the manuscript demonstrates that Unilmb performs well on two separate tasks, rather than a truly unified solution whose main strength lies in handling their complex co-occurrence.
4. The paper introduces a Personalized Graph Perturbation Strategy, claiming it customizes augmentation for small graphs or minority-class graphs . However, the paper fails to explain or validate why a perturbation strategy based on average degree would be suitable for addressing class imbalance. 
3. The AirGraph dataset, which exhibits strong practical application potential, is newly introduced; thus, a more detailed exposition of this experiment is warranted in the main body.

### Summary
The paper introduces UniImb, a unified framework tackling both class and topological imbalance in graph classification. The core novelty lies in the Dynamic Balanced Prototype (DBP) module that learns balanced prototype representations to reduce bias toward majority graphs. UniImb enhances graph representations and achieves up to 41.6% and 20.6% gains on class- and topology-imbalanced tasks, respectively.

### Strengths
(1) The experimental results are comprehensive.

(2) The imbalance graph classification is a very important problem, and the imbalance phenomenon is very widely encountered across many real-world applications, such as drug discovery.

(3) The paper also introduces another air-pollution graph classification dataset, which might be of interest to the following research.

### Weaknesses
(1) The main weakness is the novelty of the study. Although imbalance graph classification is indeed a very important problem, the more realistic setting, as the field advances, should focus on graphs aligned more with reality, such as graphs with 3D structures.

(2) The proposed method stacks many different techniques together, which makes the core contribution hardly justified. Although the ablation study has demonstrated that the most critical part is DBP, it might be more interesting to intuitively demonstrate how DBP can benefit the imbalance graph classification. Specifically, what new signals have been learned by introducing DBP techniques?

### Questions
(1) Since the main contribution lies in DBP, it might be more effective to focus solely on this technique rather than stacking it with multiple others, such as TopoEncoding. Emphasizing DBP’s independent efficacy would strengthen the justification of its contribution—particularly if experimental evidence can directly show that DBP alone mitigates class imbalance.

(2) It would also be valuable to provide an intuitive and visual illustration of how DBP alleviates both quantitative and topological imbalance. For instance, does the learned DBP reflect specific topological patterns that are desirable for minority-class test graphs but absent in the minority-class training data? Such visualization could make the mechanism and impact of DBP more tangible and convincing.

(3) My main concern, as noted in the weakness section, lies in the real-world practicality of the study. While the analyzed graphs are important, they do not capture realistic structural properties, such as the 3D conformations of proteins and molecules, which are crucial in real-world applications. This limitation raises concerns about the method’s applicability to domains where complex structural dependencies and class imbalance are pervasive.
