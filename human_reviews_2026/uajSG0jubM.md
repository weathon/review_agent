- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 4, 4, 6

## Abstract
Accurate whole-brain computational modeling grounded in single-neuron resolution connectivity is crucial for understanding how large-scale brain structures give rise to complex behaviors and cognition. Conventional mouse whole-brain models are typically constructed from coarse-grained regional or voxel-level connectivity, without considering single-neuron biological plausibility in the mouse brain connectome. In this study, we build a mouse digital twin brain (mouse DTB) at single-neuron resolution with large-scale spiking neural network, able to support complex behavioral tasks at whole-brain scale. We developed the mouse brain connectivity at single-neuron resolution through a data-driven pipeline that integrates high-resolution axonal projection data and spatial distributions of cells from the mouse brain cell atlas. The resulting neuronal connectivity is coupled with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and conductance-based synapses to form a large-scale spiking neural network of the mouse brain. The mouse DTB successfully reproduced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals observed in both resting state and olfactory Go/No-Go discrimination task with high correlation, and exhibits correct behavioral responses aligned with perceptual odor inputs. This model leverages diffusion ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) and hierarchical Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Our work provides a single-neuron resolution, whole-brain mouse DTB, offering a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics, behavior and cognition underlying mouse intelligence during complex tasks.

### Summary
The paper presents a simulation spiking network attempting to match the statistics, connectivity and properties of an actual mouse brain.
The method consists of 3 steps:
1. Taking amount of cells and there positions from the Allen brain spacial transcriptomics dataset and model connectivity between this cells based via kernel regression using voxel connectivity as a target. At this step the method also assigns the cells excitatory (E) or inhibitory (I) type based on  E/I ratio of neurons in each brain region based on some biologically available estimates.
2. Balance in- and out- degrees per neuron for better biological plausibility
3. Sampling local connections from Gaussian distribution to compensate for big injection volume.

The method also simulations the current for resting state and olfactory stimulations and comapres it with the BOLD signals from the real experiments

### Strengths
1. **Ambitious scope and integration**. The paper attempt to solve a challenging and meaningful problem, creating a simulation for the whole mouse brain at a single cell resolution.
2. **Valid minimal assumptions and data-driven implementation**. The minimal biological assumptions are already implemented (e.g. both inhibitory and excitatory cells are modelled). The authors develop a pipeline that combines voxel-scale projections (10 µm) and cell-type densities to infer connectivity.
3. **Validation on empirical fMRI data**. The paper compares it's simulation with the BOLD signals from real experiments, highlighting the potential for in-silico experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. **Methods limitations description is missing**. The limitations of the method are not adequately reflected, they are not even mentioned in the main text. For example, a clear limitation is that inhibitory cell types usually operate at 2 different timescales, with PV cells being faster than SST cells, which is currently not a part of the model (all cells are just modelled as inhibitory) (see corresponding citations for PV and SST in [1]). Additionally, the modelling is only done at the level of brain regions and more fine-grained structures (for instance, the layers of visual cortex) are not modelled.
2. **Method validation on known connectomes is missing**. Modelling a whole mouse brain is an ambitious task and due to the lack of real single-cell ground truth data it is impossible to check if the modelling is correct. However, we do have a digitalised brain of a Drosophila [2] and trying to reconstruct its brain using same governing principles as for mouse and comparing it with the measured average atlas could be a good sanity check / proof-of-concept for the method.
3. **The description of model fitting lack details**. The hierarchical Bayesian/EnKF assimilation description is too high-level - it’s unclear which parameters were optimized, how priors were chosen, and what constraints ensure biological interpretability.
4. **fMRI is not enough**. The model is constrained and validated by fMRI BOLD signals, which are a slow, indirect measure of neural activity. So it is unclear if the elecrophysiological activity of the MouseDBT is actually realistic on faster (e.g. calcium or spiking) timescales, especially due to the iterative optimization process enforcing a uniform distribution of out-degrees to match the fixed in-degrees (which is not true for all of the cell types). Some single neuronal data from different brain areas could be used from IBL dataset [3], for instance. Also, some typical cell microcircuit motifs are knows [1, 4] but they have not been cross-checked in the model (if they emerge during optimisation).

### Questions
1. Recently a reconstruction of a cubic millimiter of mouse brain has been published, including connectivity data. Why you have not used this data in your study? To the best of my knowledge it is the largest and publicly available connectivity dataset for mice
2. What are the limitations of your method? For example, what are the limitations of the hierarchical mesoscale data assimilation that you use for parameter inference?
3. You report that simulations are done on a cluster with 640 GPUs (lines 279-281) - is it needed for both training and inference? Is there a possibility to optimize the compute requirements as not many academic labs have access for this type of infrastructure?
4. How independent is the validation data from the assimilation data? Were some voxels or sessions held out entirely during fitting?
5. Given the scale of the model, how do you address potential overparameterization or lack of identifiability in the assimilation step? Specifically, the model has tens of millions of neurons and billions of synaptic parameters, yet the data used for fitting are low-dimensional fMRI BOLD signals (thousands of voxels). Because BOLD is a slow, spatially blurred proxy for neural activity, many distinct combinations of micro-level parameters (synaptic weights, time constants, background currents, etc.) could produce very similar BOLD outputs. How big are the differences between the derived models if they are fitted several times (like training classic DL models on several seeds)?
6. In lines 470-474 you report *"DTB achieved an average sequence accuracy of 67.33±6.64%, and an average odor discrimination accuracy of 55.56±9.39%"*. What would be the by chance values?

### Summary
This manuscript presents a spiking network model of whole mouse brain. 

1. It infers the whole-brain weighted directed connectivity fom Allen mouse axonal projection data at single neuron resolution. 
2. Upon this connectivity, a whole-brain spiking network comprising approximately 71 million neurons and1.02 trillion synapses was constructed. 
3. Parameters and external inputs were estimated using ensemble Kalman filtering and hierarchical bayesian inference to reproduce BOLD signal in resting state and olfactory Go/No-Go tasks. 
4. After data asimilation, resting-state whole-brain voxel correlation coefficient peaks at 0.901; task-state average correlation across 9 sessions approximately 0.554; behavioural decoding accuracy around 55.6% (exceeding random chance at 50%).

Many methods have been used in prviously studies. I think core innovation lies in establising a workflow for modeling whole-brain spiking network model of mouse based on voxel-level axonal projection data, and fMRI neural activity data. 

However, important comparisons and evaluations are missing:

1. Comparison with population approaches (such as the Virtual Mouse Brain, which is well established and achieve the same brain activity simulation) is missing, 
2. and the advantage of single-neuron model over population rate model is not demonstrated, 
3. and the validation of biological plausibility of reconstructed network connectivity is missing.

### Strengths
This manuscript demonstrates significant engineering achievement that cnstruct a whole-brain mouse model at single-neuron resolution.

1. First single-neuron–resolution connectome infered from meso-scale data (Oh et al., 2014). 
2. First whole-brain mouse model at single neuron resolution. 
3. First application of hierarchical Bayes (HMDA) methods (Lu et al. 2024a) to fit hyperparameters of spiking networks to integrate fMRI data.

### Weaknesses
**Major concerns**:

1. The reason why only optimize AMPA conductance (instead of others) hyperparameters is not clear. 
2. The validation of the biological plausibility of constructed connectivity is weak. 
  - Comparison of the connectivity matrices before and after optimization shows that optimization significantly alters connectivity patterns, but this does not verify whether the optimized connectivity is more biologically consistent. 
  - The paper stated that the single-neuron axonal projection data (Qiu et al., 2024) + Gaussian local connectivity has a high cosine similarity with the constructed connevitity. Howover, why add Gaussian local connectivity? How about removing the presummed Gaussian local connectivity? Intuitively, Gaussian local connectivity will dominate the whole connectivity.  
  - In particular, "degree balancing" is likely to significantly change the natural degree distribution (degree index/power-law tail, Gini, assortativity, motif), weakening the correspondence with real network statistics? 
  - The criteria for replacing 50% of projection connections (CH/CB) and 10% (BS) are unclear. 
3. The effectiveness of the digital twin mouse brain should be evaluated, since task performance is poor. The whole-brain correlation coefficient during task-state processing was only 0.554±0.019, significantly lower than that during resting state processing.  More seriously, Behavioral decoding accuracy was only 55.56±9.39% (barely above chance). The hit rate was only 24.45±20.14%, indicating that the model struggled to capture Go responses. The paper attributes this to "assimilation quality" and "decoder overfitting" (lines 1330-1341), but this exposes fundamental limitations of the model.
4. Lack of neuronal-level validation. Only BOLD signals at the population level were validated. No comparison with actual electrophysiological recordings (spike trains, LFP). Moreover, the advantage of single-neuron model over traditional population rate model is not demonstrated.  The average firing rate is approximately 4.2 Hz, but there is no discussion of whether this is consistent with the actual activity of different brain regions.
5. Lack of comparison of population rate models. The Virtual Mouse Brain (Francesca, 2017) has been very successful to reproduce BOLD signal and functional connevtivities of mouse brain. Why single-neuron resolution spiking model?
6. Random assignment of E/I neurons may be an oversimplification.
7. Axonal delay is not used. 

**Small concerns**:

- What do "CH", "BS", "CB" mean in Figure 1? Please give explanations in caption.  
- The figure legend is too small. 
- Many typos, for example:
   - line 026, EnKF is redundant
   - line 248, ", In iteration"
   - line 320, "we ??? the total energy"
   - "mosue"
   - "somatosensoty"

### Questions
1. line 238, "due to storage limitations", what does this mean? is it the device memory of GPU?
2. (Oh et al., 2014) provides 100 µm voxel segments? how can this work map the projection the scale of 10 µm ?

### Summary
This work proposes a data-driven pipeline to construct the single-neuron connectivity of the mouse brain and uses this connectome to build a whole-brain spiking neural network. 

The authors fit simulated BOLD signals to empirical fMRI data in specific stimulated regions and then evaluate the model's ability to predict whole-brain BOLD responses in non-stimulated regions. The model achieves a high correlation of 0.901 in the resting state, but this predictive correlation and the subsequent behavioral decoding accuracy  are significantly lower in the olfactory task.

### Strengths
1.  **Good engineering efforts:** The work presents a systematic, data-driven pipeline for building a single-neuron connectome and demonstrates its simulation on a large-scale computing cluster, representing a significant engineering achievement.
2. **Strong validation via ablation:** Detailed ablation studies in appendix confirm that introducing random rewiring or using the non-optimized connectivity significantly degrades performance.

### Weaknesses
1. **Strong assumption on the connectome's biological plausibility:** The raw, data-derived connectivity is biologically implausible (e.g., 47 million neurons with zero out-degree) and is forcibly reshaped into a balanced network (out-degree $\approx 16,000$) via an iterative optimization algorithm. While this step is necessary for the model to function (improving correlation from 0.738 to 0.901), it makes the final connectome an engineered solution whose biological uniqueness is questionable.
2. **Unexplained performance gap between resting-state and task-state:** The paper fails to explain the large performance gap between the resting-state (0.901 correlation) and the task-state (0.554 correlation) in non-assimilated regions. This discrepancy suggests the connectivity pipeline may not be capturing task-relevant network structures.
3. **Poor decoding accuracy:** The task-state behavioral decoding accuracy is only 55.56%, barely above the 50% chance level. This weak result is driven almost entirely by a high correct rejection (No-Go) rate (87.17%), while the hit (Go) rate is extremely low (24.45%), severely weakening the claim of reproducing "intelligent behavioral responses."

### Questions
1. Randomness is introduced when sampling connections during the optimization and when assigning E/I neuron types. How does this stochasticity affect the stability and variance of the BOLD signal fitting results?
2. The neuron reconstruction method, which merges voxels using Breadth-First Search (BFS), seems highly sensitive to the initial seed voxel and search order. How does the potential instability of this algorithm affect the final reconstruction?
3. The parameters for NMDA, $\text{GABA}\_\text{A}$, and $\text{GABA}\_\text{B}$ synapses appear to be missing from Table 1. And it is not clear whether the whole-brain synaptic weights are tuned during fitting or fixed.
4. In Figure 4(d) , doubling the synaptic degree from 8,000 to 16,000 yields almost no improvement in the whole-brain correlation coefficient. This suggests the additional 8,000 connections provide no meaningful benefit for fitting the neural dynamics.

### Summary
The authors present MouseDBT, a large-scale “digital twin” of the mouse brain (~7.3B parameters). The main contribution is an engineering pipeline that combines axonal projection data with cell-atlas densities to build a whole-brain spiking network. The three key steps are: (i) estimating long-range projection connectivity from tracer data, (ii) reconstructing single-neuron axonal projections and rebalancing degrees to match target in/out-degree constraints, and (iii) adding local Gaussian connectivity to capture short-range structure. The model is evaluated on resting-state fMRI and an olfactory Go/No-Go task. Results show that interoception-driven inputs reproduce resting-state dynamics and that task simulations partially capture decision-related activity.

### Strengths
- A full-brain spiking network with conductance-based neurons and billions of synapses is a great technical achievement
- The three-stage, data-driven construction is well explained and logically structured
- Uses explicit fMRI data assimilation to link simulated dynamics to measured signals
- The interoception-driven resting-state hypothesis is a coherent and biologically motivated interpretation

### Weaknesses
- The pipeline forces out-degrees to match in-degree targets, which aligns with hippocampal data but may not generalize to other structures. Similarly, applying identical Gaussian local connectivity parameters across all brain regions could distort region-specific circuit properties.
- The model’s assimilation fits inputs and gains to specific ROIs, then reports whole-brain correlations within the same session. A more robust setup would consist in performing a cross-fold validation by analyzing the predictions on held-out sessions or ROIs
- It remains unclear which parameters are structurally identifiable from BOLD data, or whether simpler baselines (e.g. ROI-level autoregressive models, static functional connectivity) could achieve similar performance. Without such comparisons, improvements cannot be clearly attributed to the biological structure
- Simulated BOLD yields high correct-rejection but low hit rates. The authors attribute this to poor assimilation in olfactory and decision ROIs, but they do not test it or investigate alternative explanations
- No "ceiling" condition (e.g. assimilating all voxels) is reported, making it hard to interpret how much of the explainable variance is captured
- The system’s massive scale is technically impressive but computationally heavy. The paper does not explore how performance changes under network subsampling (e.g. 5-50% of neurons), which would clarify whether scale is essential for accuracy

### Questions
1. Is there a specific reason to use lagged PCC with lag=3? Can the authors report PCC vs. lag (eg. like -5 to +5) for both rest and task to quantify possible timing errors in simulated BOLD?
2. Baselines comparison:
    - Functional-connectivity baseline: Can the authors test the empirical resting-state correlation matrix as a static predictor (each voxel/ROI as a weighted average of correlated ROIs). How close does this match MouseDBT’s performance?
    - Temporal baseline: Can the authors fit a ROI-level autoregressive (AR/VAR) models to the same data and report PCC? Does MouseDBT outperform these?
3. What is the training objective of HDMA (voxel-wise likelihood vs. PCC)? Are parameters fit to voxel time series or ROI averages? Is assimilation per session or pooled?
4. What is the maximum achievable correlation when assimilating all voxels (upper bound)? Can the authors provide a coverage curve for the resting state, showing whole-brain correlation as driver sets are sequentially removed. Which removals cause the largest performance drop?
5. Can the authors perform leave-one-session-out (LOSO) tests? For example, by assimilating on N-1 sessions (same ROIs), and predict the held-out session in a cross-validated way for both resting state and olfactory task. This would establish how well the model generalizes to different sessions
6. How do rest and task results change without out-degree rebalancing and local Gaussian connectivity?
7. Does MouseDBT reproduce the functional network architecture observed in empirical resting-state fMRI? Comparing the functional connectivity (FC) matrices from empirical and simulated BOLD would test whether the model captures network structure beyond pointwise correlations

### Summary
This paper presents a mouse digital twin brain (DTB) constructed at single-neuron resolution at scale. The author uses a data-driven pipeline to infer neuronal connectivity, and the mouse DTB reproduced BOLD signals observed in both rest and task states.

### Strengths
- Scale: Building a whole-brain mouse model with 71 million neurons. Most existing models either focus on specific circuits or use coarser regional connectivity. This work bridges that gap.

- Pipeline: The pipeline for inferring single-neuron connectivity from voxel-level data is sensible and well-explained. The validation is easy to understand which is reproducing BOLD signals in two states.

- Ablation: Useful ablations examining how synaptic degree, different interoceptive regions, affect model performance.

### Weaknesses
1. It's good to see some single-neuron level validation instead of regional level.

2. The paper mentioned many related works, but didn't compare with one.

### Questions
1. Can you demonstrate why model's resting state performance is much better than task state? Any insights?

2. What is the quantitative impact of the iterative optimization on connectivity? (sec. 3.1.2)
