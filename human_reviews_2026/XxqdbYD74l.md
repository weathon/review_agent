- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 4, 4, 6, 6

## Abstract
Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve along time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

### Summary
This paper focuses on temporal evolution of 3d medical imaging, given traditional works are either reliant on single prior scan or fixed grid time. Also they further make prediction on voxel level rather than traditionally global level. The method used is flow matching which learns dynamics in ODE field. Experiments on three medical imaging datasets showed improvement.

### Strengths
- The idea of continuous sequence-to-image forecasting model for 3D medical imaging is interesting, as there were few that tried to address both discrete and continuous space.
- Demonstrates multi-context learning beyond disease-specific priors. It seems to generalize to different dataset types (cardiac, stroke, tumor).

### Weaknesses
- The temporal model feels suboptimal. For continuous setting they compute time conditioning as the mean of Fourier features: $\text{Enc}(t)=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T\gamma(t_i)$ and inject via FiLM. But averaging removes ordering and emphasizes the centroid of context times, not the relative spacing or which context frame is earlier/later. Two very different temporal configurations (e.g., times [0,1,10] vs [4,5,6]) can have similar mean embeddings but imply dramatically different dynamics. Time information relevant for rate estimation is the vector of deltas $\{t_{\text{target}}-t_i\}$, not the mean. The current encoding conflates sequences of varying lengths and spacing. So model may ignore order and rely more on spatial cues; can fail when relative timing matters (e.g., when early vs late context frames carry different predictive value).
- they stack T context volumes into $X_0=[I_1,\dots,I_T]$ and broadcast $I_{\text{target}} to X_1$. The training target in velocity space is always $I_{\text{target}}-I$ (element-wise per-channel difference), i.e., the same subtraction applied to each context channel. Different context frames correspond to different $\Delta t_i$. Using the same raw difference $I_{\text{target}}-I_i$ as a per-channel supervision makes the network learn different displacements for each channel that are unrelated to any consistent per-channel dynamics. This places the burden on $v_\theta$ to internally down-weight or rescale channels based on timestamps—again brittle and underconstrained.
- Overall one major concern would be whether continuous-time modeling actually adds value beyond what a well-tuned discrete model with adaptive interpolation can achieve. Why not simply use a dense-grid discrete model with a learned interpolation kernel

### Questions
the paper’s computational efficiency claims appear generous? While CRONOS uses less memory than ViViT (which OOMs), Table 8 shows it still uses 7–8 GB on a 40 GB GPU—more than ConvLSTM and comparable to SimVP

### Summary
This paper tackles the task of forecasting a 3D medical image at a future time given multiple prior 3D scans (a longitudinal series), even when the input scans have irregular timing. The authors propose CRONOS, a unified many-to-one framework that models continuous time by learning a spatio-temporal velocity field to warp all input volumes toward the target volume. This approach adapts the Flow Matching paradigm to operate directly in voxel space, enabling real-valued timestamp inputs within a single model. Experiments on three public datasets (cine MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal brain MRI) show that CRONOS outperforms several baseline methods in image quality metrics while using significantly less memory than diffusion-based approaches. The authors highlight that this is the first method to support multi-context continuous-time forecasting for 3D medical images, and they promise to release code and evaluation protocols for reproducibility.

### Strengths
Addresses an important, under-explored problem: The paper targets 3D medical image sequence forecasting from multiple prior scans at irregular time intervals – a challenging and clinically relevant task (e.g. disease progression) that has received limited attention.

Unified continuous-time approach: CRONOS is a novel framework combining multiple-context inputs with continuous-time prediction in one model. It appears to be the first method to handle real-valued time stamps and multiple input volumes together in 3D image forecasting, filling a gap in the literature.

Efficient flow-based method: The use of Flow Matching (ODE-based velocity learning) instead of iterative diffusion leads to a simpler, memory-efficient solution. CRONOS scales to long input sequences with substantially lower GPU memory usage and runtime, without needing expensive time-step sampling.

Strong results on diverse datasets: The proposed model demonstrates improved performance over prior baselines (including deep video models and a strong last-scan heuristic) across three different modalities. It consistently achieves higher image similarity metrics (e.g. SSIM) on cine MRI, CT perfusion, and MRI longitudinal datasets, indicating robustness across varied medical imaging scenarios.

Thorough evaluation and reproducibility: The authors conduct experiments on multiple public datasets and compare against several baseline approaches. They also commit to releasing code and standardized evaluation protocols, which enhances the work’s credibility and potential impact as a benchmark for multi-context forecasting.

### Weaknesses
Limited algorithmic novelty (major): The approach offers minimal new methodology, essentially applying the existing Flow Matching paradigm to the many-to-one 3D forecasting setting without introducing new algorithmic contributions. The core idea (learning a velocity field via flow matching) is borrowed from prior work, with novelty lying primarily in its application to this domain rather than in the technique itself.

Missing baseline comparisons (major): The evaluation lacks comparisons with several relevant continuous-time or generative baseline methods. Notably, recent (core-level related) approaches like STDiff (Ye & Bilodeau, 2023), LoCI-DiffCom (Zhu et al., 2024), and ImageFlowNet (Liu et al., 2025) are not included, leaving it unclear how CRONOS performs relative to the state-of-the-art in continuous video/volume forecasting.

Unjustified design choice: CRONOS uses a single shared velocity field to warp all input contexts toward the target, but the paper provides no clear justification or ablation for this design. It is not explained why one global velocity field (applied to all past scans) is sufficient, as opposed to using separate or time-dependent velocity fields. This raises concerns that the model might be overly restrictive or suboptimal in capturing differing motions from each context scan.

Continuous-time generalization unproven: While the method is designed for continuous time, the experiments do not explicitly validate interpolation or extrapolation to truly arbitrary time points. There is no demonstration of predicting intermediate frames between given scans or forecasting beyond the maximum training interval. Thus, the claimed continuous-time capability remains speculative, with no evidence that the model can generalize to time points outside the training distribution.

Deterministic outputs (no uncertainty modeling): The framework produces a single deterministic prediction for a given input set and time, with no probabilistic modeling or uncertainty quantification. Unlike stochastic generative models (e.g. diffusion-based methods), CRONOS cannot express multiple plausible future outcomes or estimate confidence in its predictions. This lack of uncertainty modeling is a drawback for medical forecasting, where understanding predictive uncertainty is often important.

Generality claims not well-supported: The authors suggest the approach is modality-agnostic and broadly applicable, but evidence is limited to the medical imaging domain. All experiments are on medical scans; there is no validation on other data (e.g. natural video or other 4D datasets) to support the claim of general applicability. The strong generalization claims feel somewhat overstated without testing beyond the specific modalities presented.

No interpretability analysis of flows: The learned velocity fields (which are central to the method) are not analyzed or visualized in the paper. There is no examination of whether the predicted flow patterns are physically or biologically plausible. The absence of any qualitative assessment of these flows is a missed opportunity – it remains unclear if CRONOS learns meaningful motion patterns or if the velocity field could provide insights (e.g. highlighting anatomical changes or disease progression).

### Questions
Novelty: What specific technical contributions does CRONOS introduce beyond applying standard Flow Matching to this multi-volume forecasting task? (For example, are there any new model components or training strategies, or is the contribution primarily the problem setup?)

Baselines: Have the authors evaluated CRONOS against recent continuous-time or generative baselines such as STDiff (Ye & Bilodeau, 2023), LoCI-DiffCom (Zhu et al., 2024), ImageFlowNet (Liu et al., 2025), or more state-of-the-art studies? If not, what was the rationale for omitting these comparisons, and how would the authors expect CRONOS to perform relative to those methods?

Shared velocity field: Why was a single shared velocity field used to warp all input volumes toward the target? Did the authors consider using distinct velocity fields per context or a time-varying velocity field, and if so, how might that affect the results?

Continuous-time evaluation: Can CRONOS generate predictions at arbitrary time points outside the training timestamps (for example, intermediate time interpolation or longer-term extrapolation)? If this was not tested, could the authors clarify how they expect the model to behave for times beyond the training range?

Uncertainty modeling: Do the authors plan to incorporate any form of uncertainty or stochasticity into CRONOS? For instance, could a probabilistic extension (e.g. a diffusion-based, VAE, or flow model) be used to capture multiple plausible future outcomes and quantify prediction confidence?

Generality beyond medical domain: Has CRONOS been evaluated on non-medical temporal imaging data (such as natural videos or other 4D sequences) to demonstrate its generality beyond the medical domain? If not, would the authors consider tempering the claims of broad applicability until such evidence is provided, or could they outline how the method might generalize to other domains?

Flow field interpretability: Have the authors analyzed or visualized the learned velocity fields to assess their interpretability or biological plausibility? If not, could providing such an analysis (e.g. showing whether the predicted flow aligns with known anatomical motion or expected deformation patterns) strengthen the paper’s conclusions?

### Summary
The paper introduces CRONOS which adapts Flow Matching to medical imaging. The main contributions are: (i) temporal broadcasting which treats multiple context scans as the source distribution and the broadcast target scan as the destination, (ii) dual formulation giving both discrete and continuous variants, and a (iii) unified framework handling multiple modalities without disease-specific assumptions.
Overall, the paper treats the problem of predicting future 3D medical scans from multiple past observations at irregular time intervals. This is a clinically relevant problem. Most existing methods are limited to single input images and lack continuous-time predictions.

### Strengths
1. Problem Relevance: The paper addresses a critical problem in 3D medical imaging by proposing a unified framework for continuous sequence-to-image forecasting. 

2. Technical contribution: the method makes use of Flow Matching applied to the medical imaging domain through temporal broadcasting. The theoritical formulation is clear and well defined.

3. Performance. CRONOS shows strong performance over LCI baseline and the spatio-temporal baselines across all three datasets.

3. Evaluation: The paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation on three different datasets (ACDC, ISLES, LUMIERE) with different modalities (Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, longitudinal MRI). These experiments show good generalization capabilities of CRONOS.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of expert validation: only voxel-wise metrics (NRMSE, PSNR, SSIM) are provided to assess performance but no clinical expert validation is shown nor other relevant anatomical metrics.

2. Limited improvement: CRONOS scores 94.51% vs. LCI's 92.79% SSIM on ACDC, which appears to be a small gain given the added computational cost.

3. Methodological issues: there are concerns the LOCF (Last Observed Carry Forward) filling strategy (eq 19) may introduce artifacts. Even though it is demonstrated as a key component in the ablation studies, no comparison with other approaches is shown.

4. Limited discussion of failures: The paper does not provide insights into when the model might fail.

### Questions
1. Continuous vs discrete trade-offs: there appears to be inconsistencies in Table 3 and Table 2 where continuous CRONOS (Table 3) outperforms discrete version on the continuous ACDC ablation, but not necessarily on Table 2. This raises the question when is best to use continuous vs discrete alternative?

2. Could you show what the performance means in terms of clinical impact ?

3. How does the performance scales with the number of frames and spatial resolution ?

### Summary
This paper introduces CRONOS, a flow-based framework for 3D medical image forecasting that learns continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from longitudinal scans.Unlike prior models restricted to single-context or grid-aligned timepoints, CRONOS handles both discrete and continuous timestamps by learning a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports a stack of past volumes toward a future target scan. Technically, the authors reinterpret Flow Matching (FM) (Lipman et al., 2023) as a sequence-to-image transport problem:
$X_0 = [I_1, …, I_T],\qquad X_1 = [I_{\text{target}}, …, I_{\text{target}}],$ and train a 3D U-Net $v_\theta(X_\tau,T_\tau)$ to approximate voxel-space velocities between context and target. The authors suggested two complementary variants:
1. Discrete CRONOS: uses grid embedding + last-observation-carry-forward (LOCF) to fill missing frames.
2. Continuous CRONOS: conditions directly on real timestamps via Fourier embeddings and FiLM.

Experiments on three public 3D datasets—ACDC (cardiac MRI), ISLES (perfusion CT), and LUMIERE (longitudinal glioma MRI)—show consistent improvements over ConvLSTM, SimVP, ViViT, NODE-LSTM, and the simple Last Context Image (LCI) baseline. CRONOS maintains competitive compute cost, yields sharper reconstructions, and performs best when irregular timestamps are available.

### Strengths
1. Longitudinal 4D imaging is central to disease progression analysis, yet remains underexplored by the ML community. 
2. Extending FM from noise-to-sample to multi-context-to-target volumetric flows is conceptually creative and unifies discrete and continuous-time modeling within one ODE framework.
3. The discrete/continuous variants and Fourier-time conditioning offer a simple yet flexible approach adaptable to both regularly and irregularly sampled medical series.

### Weaknesses
1. The “velocity loss” $\|v_\theta(X_\tau,T_\tau)-(I_{\text{target}}-I)\|^2$ treats voxel-intensity differences as flow supervision.
This deviates from FM’s probabilistic transport interpretation and lacks theoretical grounding in physical or latent-space dynamics.
2. ConvLSTM, SimVP, and ViViT are optimized for long, dense 2D videos, not short 3D series. Their poor results may reflect mismatch rather than true inferiority.
3. The “continuous” setting is created by subsampling ACDC; no genuinely irregular clinical series are used. Gains may arise from richer embeddings rather than true continuous modeling.

### Questions
1. Does the learned velocity field correspond to interpretable motion (can it be visualized or regularized)?
2. Could CRONOS handle autoregressive multi-step prediction, not just one-step forecasting?
3. Have you compared with a “zero + mask” imputation instead of LOCF to ensure fairness?
