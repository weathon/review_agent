## Abstract
This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing Graph Controllable Embeddings (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieves provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features which are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests.

### Summary
The paper considers the problem of controlling stochastic nonlinear dynamics with interacting objects, and proposes a graph controllable embedding framework to map the dynamics distribution to RKHS. The authors prove asymptotic convergence given sufficient samples, and show improved control cost/error over existing methods on a set of numerical examples.

### Strengths
1. The idea of extending RKHS for nonlinear control to stochastic and multi-object settings is novel. However, such contribution is not very clear given the presentation of the paper and lack of discussion and comparison with closely related work (see weakness 2)

2. The paper is in general comprehensive, with theoretical analysis of the convergence of the proposed method, and empirical studies compared to several baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The claim on provably reduced sample complexity is not rigorous. It seems that the reduced complexity is through mean field approximation in the algorithm design. There is no formal proof that such an approximation will not degrade performance.

2. RKHS for nonlinear control has been studied in the community, and the paper seems to miss discussion and comparison with those closely related work [1-4]. 

3. The explanation of the benchmark problems is missing key details. The paper considers stochastic control, but only one example has noise (power grid), and how noise comes into the dynamics is not given. For benchmark problems in [5], it seems no noises are in the dynamics, unless the authors adapted the setting, though not mentioned in the paper.

### Summary
This paper introduces Graph Controllable Embeddings (GCE) to model and control stochastic, nonlinear, multi-object systems. The core idea is to use Hilbert space embeddings to represent the system's stochastic dynamics (probability distributions) within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The central insight is that in this space, the complex dynamics become linear, permitting simple LQR control. To implement this efficiently, GCE integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a mean field approximation. This novel approach uses adaptive, non-uniform weights to capture complex inter-object dependencies, breaking the "uniform neighbor" assumption of prior work and achieving provably low sample complexity. Experiments on robotics and large-scale, random-topology power grids demonstrate GCE is scalable, robust to noise, generalizes to unseen topologies, and outperforms baselines in both in-distribution and few-shot tests.

### Strengths
* The paper is exceptionally clear and well-written. It provides a strong motivation by precisely identifying the limitations of existing deterministic and non-controllable methods. The proposed framework is derived logically, making the theoretical foundations accessible.

* The work is built on a strong theoretical foundation. It provides a principled framework for stochastic multi-object control by extending Hilbert space embeddings (RKHS) to handle probability distributions of system dynamics, a non-trivial extension of prior deterministic approaches.

* The proposed "Hom + Mean" model is a significant innovation. By introducing adaptive Boltzmann-Gibbs weights to a mean-field approximation, the method effectively captures non-uniform neighbor interactions. This is a well-motivated improvement over prior methods that rely on misspecified uniform weighting.

* The experimental validation is thorough and compelling. The method is tested across diverse environments, including a challenging large-scale, random-topology, and noisy power grid simulation. The results convincingly demonstrate the model's scalability and superior robustness compared to baselines that fail under noise. Ablation studies on sample efficiency further validate the theoretical benefits of the model.

### Weaknesses
* The "homogeneity" assumption, which uses a single shared operator for history dynamics, appears to contradict its application to environments with explicitly heterogeneous object types (like 'Soft' and 'Rope'). It is unclear how one operator can model the distinct dynamics of different object types.

* The scalability claims are weakened by the model's design. While the mean-field approximation reduces the history term's complexity, the action term remains dense and scales quadratically with the number of objects, creating a potential bottleneck for large-scale systems.

* The adaptive weighting mechanism seems sensitive to implementation choices. The paper reports that a flexible, neural-network-based potential function was "unstable," and the best performance relied on a specific kernel choice (Gaussian). This suggests potential fragility and limits the generality of the adaptive component.

### Questions
1. How is the "homogeneity" assumption (a single shared history operator) reconciled with the clear object-type heterogeneity present in the 'Soft' and 'Rope' environments?

2. The action term's complexity remains quadratic, which appears to be the true scalability bottleneck. Could you elaborate on this design choice and whether a mean-field approximation for actions was also considered?

3. Could you provide more insight into the "unstable" behavior of the neural potential function? Does this suggest a fundamental difficulty in learning such energy functions in RKHS, or was it a more straightforward optimization challenge?

4. The framework's theoretical guarantees hinge on the use of characteristic kernels. How is this property ensured, or at least encouraged, when the kernel features are learned by the GNN encoder rather than being predefined?
5. The linearization is strongly motivated by its use with LQR, which assumes a quadratic cost. How much of the framework's value is retained for tasks with non-quadratic costs, where LQR is inapplicable and other methods (like MPC) must be used?
6. Eq. (6) replaces ψ_h ⊗ ψ_a with concatenation and neglects higher-order interactions. Can you bound or empirically assess the accuracy–complexity trade-off?”

### Summary
This paper introduces Graph Controllable Embeddings (GCE), a general framework for modeling and controlling stochastic multi-object systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. The core idea is to leverage Hilbert space embeddings to represent the system's stochastic dynamics in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where the evolution becomes linear and amenable to control. The framework innovatively combines Graph Neural Networks to encode relational structure with a mean-field approximation. This allows for adaptive, non-uniform weighting of inter-object interactions, overcoming a key limitation of prior work. The method is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees and demonstrates superior performance, especially in few-shot and noisy settings.

### Strengths
The paper's contribution is well-supported by its technical components. The proposed framework is built upon the established theory of Kernel Bayes' Rule and provides a principled way to unify several graph-based embedding approaches under a single lens. Its core technical contribution is the introduction of a mean-field approximation to model adaptive, non-uniform interactions, which addresses a specific, documented limitation of prior methods like CKO. The paper includes theoretical proofs for the convergence and sample complexity of the proposed estimators. The claims are further substantiated through a series of experiments on diverse control tasks, including comparisons against relevant baselines.

### Weaknesses
- The most efficient and recommended model variant, `Hom+Mean`, relies on a strong homogeneity assumption where all objects share the same underlying dynamics operator $C_{O|H}$. This may limit its applicability to highly heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where different types of agents (e.g., a mix of ground robots and aerial drones) possess fundamentally different transition models. The experiments, while strong, do not feature such a deeply heterogeneous environment to test this boundary.

- The framework is fundamentally limited to modeling interactions as a composition of pair-wise relationships. While using a multi-layer GNN allows information to propagate across multiple hops, it cannot capture true, non-decomposable higher-order interactions (e.g., physical effects governed by the angle between three bodies, which is not reducible to a sum of pairs). This restricts the method's utility in domains where many-body physics or complex group dynamics are dominant. The authors rightly acknowledge this as a limitation for future work.

- The current experiment seems to lack a direct contrast with a powerful nonlinear Model-Based RL baseline, and such a contrast might more powerfully demonstrate the necessity of the design choice of forced linearization.

### Questions
- The history is defined as the observation at the previous moment, which is a standard first-order Markov assumption. Is this simple historical representation sufficient for systems that require longer historical dependencies to make accurate predictions (for example, systems with momentum or hysteresis effects)?

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework named Graph Controllable Embeddings (GCE) to tackle the modeling and controlling problems of stochastic nonlinear dynamics in multi-object systems. It utilizes the linear properties of RKHS to transform complex nonlinear stochastic dynamics into linear relationships within RKHS, allowing the application of well-established linear control methods. GCE also integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) to adapt to dynamic interaction patterns and mean field approximation to reduce sample complexity. The evaluation results validate that GCE outperforms competitive methods.

### Strengths
1. The idea is novel. It leverages the linear properties of RKHS to map originally complex nonlinear stochastic dynamics into RKHS, converting them into linear relationships. This further enables the adaptation of mature linear control methods, effectively overcoming the traditional challenges of nonlinear stochastic control for multi-body systems.
2. The theoretical analysis is detailed and comprehensive. Rigorous derivations are provided for aspects including the existence and convergence of the GCE framework, the sample complexity of mean field approximation, and the property comparison of different embedding forms (such as Tensor, Dense, and Hom).
3. The experimental results are comprehensive. It covers multiple scenarios including physical systems (Rope), robotics (Soft, Swim), and power grids (Power-Grid). Additionally, tests are conducted on noise robustness, few-shot generalization, and the effects of different components (e.g., kernel function types, feature dimensions).
4. The presentation is good. The paper is easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. Regarding the theoretical analysis in this paper, although convergence and consistency are mentioned as a key contribution in the Introduction section, multi-step approximate derivations (such as Equation (6) only using first-order approximation and adaptive mean field approximation) may undermine the aforementioned theoretical characteristics, leading to a significant deviation between practical implementation and theoretical guarantees.
2. Regarding scalability and generalization, although the authors claim that the research can scale to larger graphs and more random topologies, this conclusion relies on the strong assumption of the "shared approximation operator" mentioned in Line 264 of the paper. The rationality of this inductive bias remains to be verified, which results in a lack of guarantees for the effectiveness of the method’s scalability.
