## Abstract
As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines. In parallel, differentiable rendering techniques such as Gaussian splatting have demonstrated remarkable scalability and efficiency for volumetric representations, suggesting a natural fit for GMM-based cryo-EM reconstruction. However, off-the-shelf Gaussian splatting methods are designed for photorealistic view synthesis and remain incompatible with cryo-EM due to mismatches in the image formation physics, reconstruction objectives, and coordinate systems. Addressing these issues, we propose **cryoSplat**, a GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a view-dependent normalization term and FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. These innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoSplat over representative baselines.
The code will be released at https://github.com/Chen-Suyi/cryosplat.

### Summary
Single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a field whose main goal is to reconstruct the 3D shape of molecules from thousands of transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. This field has experienced tremendous progress over the last decade, including several mature software packages for 3D reconstruction such as RELION [1], cryoSPARC [2] and CryoDRGN [3]. The reconstruction pipeline for cryo-EM is comprised of several different steps: particle picking (identifying the location of the molecules in the noisy images), estimation of the point-spread function and ab-initio reconstruction (obtaining an initial low-res reconstruction). This is typically followed by the estimation of viewing angles combined with high-resolution 3D refinement. This paper is focused on the last step: the high-resolution 3D reconstruction of a single (fixed) molecule with known viewing angles. It proposes a simple approach inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting [4] that the authors name CryoSplat. It is a more-or-less direct adaptation of 3D splatting from computer graphics to the cryo-EM domain, making the following changes to match the TEM imaging modality:
1. The projection is orthogonal, in contrast to the perspective projection (pinhole camera) model typically used in computer graphics.
2. There are no occlusions. The Gaussians are simply added together. So there's no need for a z-buffer and alpha-blending.
3. The algorithm does not need to figure out which Gaussians are outside the camera's view since the entire molecule is always in view. The authors still divide the image into tiles, but this is merely an implementation detail for better GPU performance.
4. The projection image is convolved with a point-spread function.

The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration that, given input images with matching projection orientations, a high-resolution 3D GMM model can be used to reconstruct the 3D volume using gradient-based optimization.

### Strengths
* I like the simplicity of the approach. The authors have demonstrated that one can obtain high-resolution reconstructions simply by running backprop. I am not aware of previous literature that demonstrated this.

* The paper is very clearly written.

### Weaknesses
* The benchmarks do not compare the method to leading packages for homogeneous reconstruction but only to CryoDRGN (and a backprojection baseline). While CryoDRGN is a leading package for heterogeneous reconstruction, it is not the best at homogeneous reconstruction. At a minimum, I do not think the paper can be accepted without a comparison to a leading homogeneous reconstruction method such as RELION or cryoSPARC.

* The novelty of this work is not very high in my opinion. Gaussian mixture models have been used by several authors in cryo-EM reconstruction (e.g. [5],[6]) but mostly to attack the much more difficult problem of heterogeneous reconstruction, where molecules have continuous degrees of freedom. This is probably due to the fact that in cryo-EM the homogeneous reconstruction problem is considered to be "solved". The authors acknowledge the works of Chen et al. and others, but claim that they are different from these works because they do not rely on an approximate 3D model of the molecule ("consensus model") for initialization. Indeed, CryoSplat does not require such an initial model, but it takes the orientations of the images as input.  The issue is that on experimental data the orientations are typically obtained by rotating a consensus model and comparing the resulting projections to the input images... So a consensus model is still used in the pipeline. As far as I can tell, the optimization is a straightforward application of backpropagation with no "secret sauce". Hence, the main contribution of the paper is a demonstration that backprop on a GMM with known orientations can result in high resolution models. The contribution would be much more significant if the method was able to also estimate the viewing angles from scratch.

* This submission seems to have significant overlap to GEM (ICLR submission 6298) even with regards to the choice of datasets. While not a weakness, this is something that the chairs need to take into consideration. In particular, it would not make sense to accept both papers to the same conference.

* The code was not included in the submission so I could not review it.

### Questions
* Is there any "secret sauce" in the implementation that I missed? i.e. non-standard choices in the optimization problem definition or implementation that are critical to getting the method to converge or to obtain high-resolution 3D volumes.

* Why did you not include the code in the submission? Are you willing to attach an (anonymized) zip file during the review cycle?

Minor comments (not questions).
* In Figure 1 the black and orange lines should probably have arrowheads instead of ball heads to clearly show the direction.
* The last paragraph of Section 3.3.4 seems out of place.

### Summary
The paper adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting to homogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM, using only raw picked particle images and assumed known poses. CryoSplat generally exceeds the resolution (measured via Fourier Shell Correlation) of voxel-space backprojection and CryoDRGN, on representative proteins.

### Strengths
The method is a natural combination of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which works well in computer vision, to cryo-EM homogeneous reconstruction. It includes some adaptations necessary for the forward model and high noise of cryo-EM, and quantitative results (FSC) are encouraging.

### Weaknesses
There are some aspects of the presentation that could be improved.
- The bullet point list of contributions at the end of the introduction slightly overstates the contributions, in my view. In particular, the efficient CUDA implementation would seem to be largely based on that of 3DGS, with fairly minor modifications. This is still a contribution to be sure, but the contribution description should acknowledge if this code is largely based on 3DGS code.
- Some of the descriptions of voxel-based methods strike me as a bit unfair/unsupported. For example, line 109 describes these methods as “inherently discrete”--this is not the case when voxels use interpolation beyond nearest neighbor. It is ironic that this is described as a limitation of voxels, when (although Gaussians are technically infinitely-supported) 3DGS crops the spatial extent of each Gaussian and is thus more discrete of a representation than a grid with interpolation, since there is no interpolation between distinct Gaussians. Line 124 describes Gaussian mixture models as supporting differentiable optimization; this is only the case when the Gaussians are modeled with their full support, and even so the Gaussian and its gradient are negligible over much of its support, making the gradients of limited value beyond the main ellipsoid of support. Additionally, section 4.3 describes neural representations and Gaussians as more flexible for heterogeneous reconstruction compared to voxel grids. This claim is unsupported (e.g. it is straightforward to imagine combining a canonical 3D model in the form of a voxel grid with a neural or explicit deformation/conformation model, just as one could for a neural or Gaussian representation).
- The last paragraph on page 3 describes three aspects of the original 3DGS that must be adapted for application to cryo-EM. The first is the switch from perspective to orthographic, which is clearly described. However, the second and third aspects are not clearly described. Aspect (ii) is described as prioritizing photorealism over physical accuracy, and aspect (iii) is described as misaligned coordinates with respect to the Fourier slice theorem. Aspect (ii) is too vague; aspect (iii) makes it sound like the Fourier slice theorem is used in the forward model, but this is not the case since the forward model here is applied in real-space, so it’s not clear why misaligned coordinates would be an issue. Is this because the contrast transfer function is applied in Fourier domain?
- In Figure 2, the resolution is described as being calculated based on the point where the FSC curve crosses 0.143. However, the graphs of FSC on the right of the figure seem to have arbitrary x axis scales, that do not always show where FSC for CryoSplat crosses 0.143. Moreover, the resolutions reported for CryoSplat do not seem to match these crossing points.
- In Figure 2, I acknowledge that CryoSplat achieves higher FSC. However, I am confused by this because visually in the ChimeraX figures the reconstructions from CryoSplat appear smoother than those from both backprojection and CryoDRGN, and in some cases (e.g. the second row) there are fine details in which backprojection and CryoDRGN are in agreement with each other, but the same features are not present in CryoSplat. I am not sure how to square this observation with the quantitatively higher FSC for CryoSplat, but I am concerned of a potential bug in computing FSC.
- Figure 3 caption claims that 10,000 Gaussians are usually sufficient, yet in all four subfigures there is meaningful improvement moving from 10,000 Gaussians to 30,000. Moreover, in Figure 2 CryoSplat uses 30,000 Gaussians. The goal should not be just to outperform baselines, but to maximize resolution and stability of reconstruction.
- The initialization strategy for the Gaussians is described on line 396, but the rationale behind it is not explained until the appendix. The rationale is more important than the numbers themselves.
- Section 4.2 describes some reconstructions as producing artifacts, and points out the location of artifacts in Figure 2. How can you know what is an artifact, when you do not have a ground truth volume for comparison?

### Summary
CryoSplat introduces a 3DGS-based homogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction framework that integrates orthographic Gaussian splatting with the physics of electron imaging. The method derives a projection model with view-dependent normalization and FFT-aligned coordinates so that real-space rendering remains consistent with Fourier-based acquisition. A CUDA-accelerated rasterizer supports tens of thousands of anisotropic Gaussians optimized from random initialization using a simple MSE loss. One advantage of cryoSplat comparing to the previous methods such as E2GMM is cryoSplat can converge from random initialization without the need of the traditional consensus reconstruction. Extensive experiments have conducted on EMPIAR-10028, 10049, 10076, and 10180 with provided poses and CTFs, cryoSplat consistently surpasses backprojection and CryoDRGN in FSC resolution, reaching 2.49 Å on EMPIAR-10049.

### Strengths
1. The paper adapts Gaussian splatting to cryo-EM with a physically grounded orthographic projection, view-dependent normalization, and FFT-aligned coordinates, enabling stable reconstruction from random initial Gaussians without external priors. 
2. The CUDA-based renderer and simple MSE objective deliver practical efficiency, achieving 2–3× higher rendering throughput than CryoDRGN, convergence in five epochs, and support for up to 30k Gaussians.
3. Experiments on four EMPIAR datasets show consistent FSC gains over backprojection and CryoDRGN—including a 2.49 Å resolution on EMPIAR-10049, and the ablations intelligently cover both fidelity and runtime, showing that larger Gaussian sets improve accuracy while incurring longer training and rendering.
4. The exposition is clear and well-motivated, the paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Even with 30k Gaussians, the reconstructions in Fig. 2 remain noticeably smoother than the backprojection or CryoDRGN baselines, raising the concern that the strong Gaussian prior could yield high FSC scores while underfitting finer details. Please explore much larger mixtures—e.g., 50k or 100k components—to see whether the qualitative sharpness catches up and whether the FSC improvements persist or saturate.
2. The Gaussian-count ablation suggests almost linear gains in FSC as N increases, without clear signs of convergence, so it is unclear how the model behaves in the low-capacity regime. A complementary study reducing N well below 2,048 would clarify whether the FSC metric stays artificially high despite visibly degraded reconstructions, helping disentangle genuine data fit from prior-driven smoothing.
3. The current evaluation remains limited to homogeneous reconstruction and compares primarily against CryoDRGN, which targets continuous heterogeneity; adding a popular cryoSPARC baseline with the same pose inputs, and outlining how cryoSplat could extend beyond static cases would make the empirical story more compelling.

### Questions
Addressing the following points, which is aligned with the weaknesses above, would help me reassess the paper more favorably.

1. Provide qualitative comparisons or additional reconstructions (e.g., with 50k–100k Gaussians) to check whether sharper details emerge and the FSC gains remain trustworthy.
2. Extend the Gaussian-count ablation to much smaller mixtures so we can see whether the FSC metric genuinely tracks reconstruction quality when capacity drops.
3. Include a cryoSPARC baseline that uses the same pose inputs, and discuss about the future direction for adapting cryoSplat to heterogeneous or dynamic reconstruction.

### Summary
The paper proposes cryoSplat, a new method for homogeneous reconstruction in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). cryoSplat leverages Gaussian splatting, a differentiable rendering technique, to achieve stable and efficient reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM data. The authors introduce key innovations, including orthogonal projection-aware splatting and FFT-aligned coordinate systems, designed to improve the method's compatibility with cryo-EM's unique imaging physics. Experimental results on real datasets show that cryoSplat outperforms existing methods in terms of resolution, robustness to noise, and speed of convergence, providing a new foundation for GMM-based cryo-EM reconstruction.

### Strengths
### Innovative Methodology:

The integration of Gaussian splatting with cryogenic electron microscopy is novel and promising. This method represents an important step forward in making GMM-based approaches more feasible for cryo-EM.

The differentiable rendering approach combined with physically accurate projections offers a significant improvement over previous methods that relied on external priors or atomic models for initialization.

### Theoretical Soundness:

The authors carefully derive their projection model, which aligns well with the cryo-EM imaging process, addressing crucial issues like coordinate system alignment and view-dependent normalization. These innovations are necessary for physically accurate reconstructions and ensure that the method is well-grounded in cryo-EM physics.

### Empirical Validation:

The paper presents comprehensive experiments on real datasets, including datasets with varying levels of noise and structural complexity. The results show clear improvements in terms of resolution and robustness to heterogeneity.

The ablation studies and runtime efficiency analysis add further value, demonstrating the method’s ability to scale and deliver faster convergence compared to existing techniques like CryoDRGN.

### Practicality and Efficiency:

The CUDA-accelerated real-space renderer ensures that the method is computationally efficient, allowing for scalable optimization even with tens of thousands of Gaussians.

The use of simple but effective mean squared error (MSE) loss simplifies the optimization process, eliminating the need for complex regularizations while ensuring stable training.

### Weaknesses
### Limited Scope of Validation:

While the experiments on real datasets demonstrate strong performance, the method's robustness in heterogeneous reconstruction and in the face of ab initio reconstruction (with unknown particle poses) is not fully explored. The current work assumes known poses, which limits the scope of the method's applicability to real-world cryo-EM challenges.

Future work should explore how cryoSplat performs with pose estimation or heterogeneous reconstruction methods, as this is a critical challenge in cryo-EM.

### Dependency on Known Poses:

The current version of cryoSplat does not tackle the ab initio reconstruction problem where poses are unknown. It would be valuable to investigate how cryoSplat could be extended to tackle this challenge, which is a key strength of recent methods like CryoDRGN.

### Impact of Initialization:

While cryoSplat is robust in its random initialization, it would be useful to further analyze the potential impact of different initialization schemes. In certain cases, random initialization might still pose a challenge, especially for highly flexible or heterogeneous particles. Additional insights into initialization strategies could be helpful.

### Interpretability of Gaussian Mixtures:

The use of GMMs in cryo-EM reconstruction provides a compact and interpretable model, but more discussion on how this model relates to atomic-level resolution or finer structural details would be beneficial. For instance, how do the learned Gaussian parameters map to the structural features of macromolecules?

### Questions
### Handling Ab Initio Reconstruction:

While this paper shows strong results for homogeneous reconstruction with known particle poses, it would be insightful to know if the authors have any plans to extend cryoSplat to handle ab initio reconstruction. Specifically, how would the method perform when the particle orientations are unknown or the dataset is highly heterogeneous?

### Impact of Initialization:

The paper mentions that cryoSplat can converge from random initialization, but how sensitive is the method to the choice of initialization? Could the authors explore different initialization schemes, particularly in cases where the structure is highly flexible or there are ambiguities in the starting configurations?

### Model Interpretability:

GMMs are known for their interpretability, but in the context of cryo-EM, how do the learned Gaussian parameters (amplitude, mean, covariance) relate to the atomic-level structure? Could the authors provide more insights into how the reconstructed volumes align with the fine structural features of macromolecules?

### Performance in Heterogeneous Systems:

The current paper focuses on homogeneous reconstruction. How would cryoSplat perform in heterogeneous reconstruction scenarios where different conformations coexist in the same dataset? Could the method be extended or adapted for more complex, heterogeneous systems?
