- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 2, 6, 8

## Abstract
Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG Re-ID) faces significant challenges due to appearance variations across different environments, resulting in domain shifts when models are deployed on unseen target domains. Current methods often neglect shared structural commonalities across identities, which limits their ability to generalize and recognize fine-grained identity details effectively. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework, which integrates two complementary strategies: mining stable local commonalities and modeling local perturbations. The Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL) module builds a memory bank of local features and utilizes clustering-driven similarity learning to balance structural consistency and discriminative granularity. Simultaneously, the Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS) generates adversarial samples that simulate cross-domain appearance variations while preserving local semantic structures. To further improve robustness to domain shifts, we introduce a Clean-Adv Local Cosine Alignment constraint, which ensures feature consistency between clean and adversarial samples in the local semantic space. Extensive experiments on DG Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

### Summary
This study introduces an Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework to enhance domain generalization in person re-identification (Re-ID). The key innovation lies in its dual-stream architecture, which synergistically combines Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL) and Dual-Stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS). CILL clusters local features across identities using a memory bank and triplet loss to strengthen discriminative representations. DAPS generates adversarial samples through controlled perturbations, forcing the model to focus on stable structural cues while preserving semantic integrity. A cosine similarity loss further aligns clean and adversarial feature directions, mitigating overfitting to unstable low-level attributes. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains: Overall, ADSL provides a robust approach to cross-domain Re-ID by harmonizing local consistency and adversarial robustness.

### Strengths
1.Originality: The proposed Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework demonstrates significant originality within the Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG Re-ID) field. The central innovation lies in the intricate combination of CILL (Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning) and DAPS (Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy), orchestrated under the ADSL paradigm. While both local feature learning and adversarial training are established techniques in Re-ID, their synergistic integration, with a specific focus on simultaneously modeling stable local commonalities and local perturbations, presents a novel approach. This unique amalgamation of techniques results in a distinctive methodological framework that tackles the complexities of DG Re-ID from multiple engineered dimensions, aiming for both improved structural robustness and fine-grained discriminative power.
2.Quality: The experimental design is rigorous: a multi-source domain transfer setting is adopted, covering a mixed indoor and outdoor scenario; ablation experiments  quantitatively demonstrate that the contribution rate of each module ranges from 18% to 30%. Solid theoretical support: clear formula derivation , and T-SNE visualization intuitively demonstrates the improvement effect of feature distribution.
3.Clarity: The paper demonstrates strong clarity across multiple dimensions, significantly contributing to the reader's understanding of the proposed methodology: (1)Problem Articulation: The authors present a highly lucid articulation of the core challenges in Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG Re-ID), effectively highlighting issues such as domain shift due to appearance variations, and the critical limitation of neglecting shared structural commonalities across identities. This clear problem definition sets a firm foundation for the proposed solution. (2)Methodological Intent: The intended purpose of the Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL) framework, along with its constituent modules, is explicitly and clearly conveyed. The distinct roles of CILL (Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning) in mining stable local commonalities and DAPS (Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy) in modeling local perturbations are well-defined. The overarching goal of improving generalization capabilities and recognizing fine-grained identity details is also unequivocally stated. (3)Modular Functionality and Interaction: The functions of each module are clearly delineated. For CILL, the description of leveraging a memory bank with clustering-driven similarity learning provides a clear mechanistic overview. Similarly, DAPS’s role in generating adversarial samples is readily understood. The synergistic interaction between these modules, encapsulated within the ADSL framework, is also presented in a straightforward manner, allowing readers to grasp how the components are integrated to achieve the stated objectives.
4. Significance: This work establishes a novel paradigm for the integration of local feature modeling and adversarial learning, paving the way for future research in this domain.The pressing demand for DG Re-ID in applications such as security surveillance necessitates efficient solutions for complex cross-domain scenarios. ADSL offers a potent and effective approach to address these challenges.

### Weaknesses
1.CILL attempts to “mine stable local commonalities”and “balance structural consistency and recognition granularity”, which sounds like searching for visual patterns suitable for cross identity sharing. However, the ultimate goal of Re ID is precisely to distinguish identities. If CILL overly emphasizes "commonality", it may blur the subtle differences between different identities, especially the key "refined details" that determine identity. For example, if two people with different identities wear similar clothes, CILL may pull their local features too close. The paper should provide a clearer explanation of how the loss function of CILL (such as formulas 2 and 3) emphasizes the key details of distinguishing different identities while maintaining local commonalities. For example, the negative logarithmic term in formula 2 is actually used for maximum likelihood estimation (or maximizing similarity), while trielet loss and CE loss emphasize discrimination. We need to explain how these three work together.
2.DAPS simulates "changes in image contrast, brightness or texture details" by "randomly applying perturbations to mask areas". Although this can increase the robustness of the model, this random mask and fixed type of disturbance may not be able to fully capture the complex and changeable cross domain changes in the real world (for example, serious lighting changes, camera noise, resolution differences, seasonal clothing changes, etc.). The paper needs to prove that the confrontation samples generated by the model can effectively promote the generalization of the model to various unprecedented fields in the real world. It is suggested to consider integrating various types of local disturbances (such as color jitter+blur+sharpening, simulated Gaussian noise, simulated low resolution, etc.) into DAPS, or using more advanced countermeasures generation technology to generate more challenging and diverse disturbances. It may provide specific evidence of the diversity of confrontation samples: for example, show some particularly challenging confrontation samples, and the performance of the model in this case.
3.The ability to “identify and refine identity details” has been repeatedly mentioned in the paper. However, the current experiment lacks indicators to directly measure this ability. It is suggested to design special subtasks, for example, to evaluate by introducing data sets with fine attribute labels (such as clothing patterns and shapes), or to analyze the specific performance of models in distinguishing pedestrian pairs that are “very similar” (mainly depending on local details). This argument will be strongly supported by convincing visual analysis of attention.
4. Although ablation experiments are mentioned in the abstract, the quantitative analysis of the respective contributions of CILL and DAPS, the discussion of their interactions, and the depth of sensitivity analysis of key super parameters (such as memory size, disturbance intensity, loss weight) still need to be strengthened. A detailed ablation study will reveal the internal mechanism of the ADSL framework and prove the necessity and effectiveness of its various components.
5. As the author has not open the source code of the paper, I am unable to verify its experimental results. Therefore, I suggest that the author makes the code and experimental data publicly available on platforms such as Github, and provides a detailed description of the experimental setup, in order to facilitate the development of the community.

### Questions
1.The CILL module proposed in the article aims to learn "cross-identity local commonalities" to enhance domain generalization, while the paper emphasizes that this method can "identify fine-grained identity details". Could you elaborate on how CILL strikes a balance between these two aspects? Specifically, what types of local features (such as the overall style of clothing, the relative position of body parts) are the "commonalities" it uncovers, and how are the "fine-grained details" (such as patterns on clothing, specific textures, minor posture differences of individuals) retained for identity differentiation? Could you provide a specific example to illustrate how CILL achieves accurate differentiation by retaining fine-grained details when dealing with two pedestrians with similar commonalities but different identities?
2.The DAPS strategy proposed in this paper simulates cross domain changes through "random local disturbance". Please specify how the type (such as contrast, brightness, texture variation) and generation method (such as random mask) of this local disturbance fully cover the most challenging real world domain offset in Re ID tasks? For example, can it effectively cope with the subtle visual differences caused by different camera sensor imaging characteristics, different weather (rainy, snowy, haze), different time periods (day, night), and clothing materials (reflective, frosted)? Can you provide some experimental results from public data sets or test sets built by yourself with typical real world domain offsets to prove the robustness of DAPS?
3. What is the overall computational complexity (training time and reasoning speed) and model scale of the ADSL framework considering the memory library operation of the CILL module, the confrontation training of DAPS, and the dual stream structure? Compared with other SOTA DG Re ID methods, how does ADSL perform on these key efficiency indicators? How scalable is ADSL in actual deployment scenarios (for example, large-scale video surveillance systems)?

### Summary
The submission considers domain-generalizable person re-ID. The main idea is combining (i) Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL): it is achieved by a memory bank, which clusters local features, and (ii) a Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS): it perturbs masked local regions and aligns clean vs. adversarial local features via cosine loss. They work together to mine shared local structures (e.g., head/torso/legs) and harden them against appearance shifts (e.g., lighting, color, texture). Experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, and MSMT17 show that the proposed method achieves consistent gains over prior DG baselines.

### Strengths
+ The motivation is sound: Leveraging local features for generalization is good. It is achieved by clear local-feature focus with part tokens and a concrete clustering formulation

+ Ablation studies are clear, isolating CILL, DAPS, and cosine alignment; each adds measurable gains across targets.

### Weaknesses
- Novelty overlap. Adversarial training + memory-bank clustering over part features is incremental relative to DG re-ID lines (domain-invariant features, adversarial training, part-based models). These techniques are commonly used in re-ID, so please clarify the main contribution beyond a component mix. 

- Discussion on Adversary. The intensity-only, monotone mapping may not cover major cross-domain factors (e.g., camera geometry, blur, weather, occlusion, pose). How about stronger pixel-space/feature-space attacks or style-statistic perturbations (e.g., MixStyle/DSU)?

- Part definition. Parts come from ViT patch groupings; it’s unclear how stable the head/torso/leg assignment is across domains. The method section doesn’t quantify part consistency or failure modes. 

- Hyperparameter sensitivity. Only λ1, λ2 are probed; k, temperature τ, memory momentum μ, and attacker budget δ likely affect stability. How sensitive is the framework to hyperparameters such as the number of nearest neighbors k, temperature $\tau$, and momentum $\mu$ in the memory bank? It would be better to discuss these hyper-parameters.

### Questions
- What are the main failure cases observed in retrieval results, and under what visual conditions does ADSL struggle most?

- How are the local parts (e.g., head, torso, legs) defined and validated to remain consistent across domains and viewpoints within the Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL) module?

- Does the adversarial perturbation module introduce significant training overhead or instability compared to standard DG Re-ID models?

### Summary
This paper introduces Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL), a framework for domain generalizable person re-identification that mitigates domain shifts caused by lighting, color, and background variations. ADSL integrates two synergistic components: Cross-Identity 
Locality Learning (CILL), which leverages a memory bank and clustering-driven similarity learning to mine shared structural commonalities across identities, and Dual-Stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS), which generates local adversarial samples to simulate cross-domain variations while preserving semantic structure. By aligning clean and adversarial features through a cosine loss, ADSL encourages robust, domain-invariant local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSL achieves superior cross-domain generalization compared to existing state-of-the-art Re-ID methods.

### Strengths
1）The proposed ADSL framework combines local feature consistency learning with adversarial perturbation in a dual-stream manner, which is conceptually clear and effectively addresses domain shift from both structural and appearance perspectives. The integration of CILL and DAPS is logically coherent and technically complementary.

2）The Cross-Identity Locality Learning (CILL) module introduces a clustering-based memory bank to capture cross-identity structural commonalities, a novel approach that goes beyond traditional domain-invariant global features and strengthens fine-grained discriminability and robustness.

### Weaknesses
1）The framework divides each person's image into three fixed regions (head, torso, legs), which assumes consistent human body alignment across domains. This rigid partitioning may not generalize well to datasets with pose variation, occlusion, or imperfect detection, potentially limiting robustness in unconstrained settings.

2）The paper lacks analysis of instances where the model fails, such as confusing identities under heavy occlusion or extreme illumination. Understanding these edge cases would help clarify the framework’s boundaries and guide future improvements.

3）The memory bank in CILL aggregates features through momentum updates. How do you prevent “feature staleness” or over-representation of early batches?

4）Can you provide an analysis of which domain attributes (illumination, background, resolution) are most mitigated by ADSL, perhaps via feature-space visualization or attentionheatmap statistics?

5）Given that ADSL heavily relies on predefined local regions, how does it behave when key regions (e.g., legs) are missing or truncated in target-domain images? Have you evaluated the framework on partial-ReID or occluded ReID benchmarks to verify robustness under 
missing-part conditions?

### Summary
This paper aims to address the domain shift challenge in Domain Generalizable Person Re-ID (DG Re-ID). The authors propose a framework named Adversarial Dual-Stream Learning (ADSL). This framework comprises two core components: the Cross-Identity Local Consistency Learning (CILL) module, which utilizes a memory bank and clustering-driven similarity learning to mine stable local commonalities across different identities, and the Dual-stream Adversarial Perturbation Strategy (DAPS), which simulates cross-domain appearance variations by generating adversarial samples. Furthermore, a "Clean-Adv Local Cosine Alignment" constraint is employed to ensure feature consistency between clean and adversarial samples in the local feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing SOTA approaches on multiple standard DG Re-ID benchmarks.

### Strengths
* The method achieves SOTA results on all evaluated single-source DG Re-ID benchmarks, including transfers between Market-1501, DukeMTMC, MSMT17, and CUHK03, achieving 71.4% R1 / 51.2% mAP on M→D and 74.8% R1 / 46.7% mAP on D→M, significantly outperforming prior methods.
* The paper's core contribution DAPS is proven to be extremely effective. The ablation study clearly demonstrates that the introduction of DAPS provides the vast majority of the performance boost, as R1 accuracy on M→D jumps from 67.7% to 70.3%. This indicates that adversarial training simulating local intensity variations is a key driver for enhancing DG Re-ID generalization.
* The ADSL framework is methodologically sound. It simulates domain variations like illumination via DAPS and forces the model to learn robust features, while simultaneously attempting to mine stable local structures via CILL. This combined strategy of "enhancing robustness" and "mining invariance" is comprehensive and reasonable.
* The paper provides a thorough experimental analysis. Beyond SOTA comparisons, it includes detailed ablation studies, verifying the roles of CILL, DAPS, and $L_{cos}$, hyper-parameter analysis (for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$), and insightful qualitative visualizations (t-SNE and Grad-CAM).

### Weaknesses
* One concern is the significant disconnect between its core narrative (the importance of CILL) and the ablation study in Table 2. The CILL module as the primary embodiment of "Local Consistency" in the title provides a very small improvement over the baseline (M→D R1: 66.3% → 67.7%; M→MS R1: 39.4% → 41.2%). This suggests CILL is not a key performance driver, while DAPS is.
* The paper presents CILL and DAPS as two complementary and equally important strategies. However, the experimental evidence overwhelmingly indicates DAPS is the primary contributor. The paper should be more transparent about this, framing DAPS as the main finding and contribution.
* The method is called an Adversarial Dual-Stream Strategy. However, DAPS does not use a standard GAN discriminator for domain confusion. Instead, it uses an adversarial attack to generate adversarial samples. It might be more accurate to call it a "Robustness Strategy based on Adversarial Perturbations" to differentiate it from GAN-based DG methods.
* The baseline in the ablation study (ViT-B/16 + local region CE and Triplet losses) already achieves 66.3% R1 / 47.5% mAP (M→D), which is a very strong baseline. Comparing this baseline to baseline results from other published DG Re-ID papers would be beneficial to assess the true gain brought by CILL and DAPS.

### Questions
* As noted in the Weaknesses, the gain from CILL is very small. Can the authors explain why? Is it possible that the local triplet/CE losses in the baseline model already capture sufficient local discriminability, leaving little value for CILL's cross-identity clustering loss to provide?
* Please clarify in the rebuttal: is $L_{CML}$ in Equation (6) simply $L_{CILL}$?Role of $L_{CILL}^{adv}$ in DAPS: How was the "DAPS without $L_{cos}$" model in the ablation study trained? According to Equation (9), the total loss includes $\lambda_1 L_{CILL}^{adv}$. Does "without $L_{cos}$" imply that the model simply minimizes the $L_{CILL}$ loss on both clean and adversarial samples simultaneously?
* The CILL objective aims to pull visually similar local features closer to learn cross-identity commonalities. Does this not create an intrinsic conflict with the $L_{triplet}$ and $L_{ce}$ objectives, which aim to maximize separability between identities?
* How much additional training overhead does ADSL introduce compared to the baseline model? Specifically the dual-stream forward pass, the memory bank, and the $L_{cos}$ calculation.
