## Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely diminishes patients’ quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on physicians’ expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed \PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86% accuracy on external tests and over 96\% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.

### Summary
This paper presents PD Diag-Net, a clinically prioritized deep learning framework for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The proposed model integrates multi-modal clinical features (such as motor and non-motor symptoms, gait signals, and imaging data) using a hierarchical feature fusion strategy designed to emphasize clinically interpretable biomarkers. The network introduces a Clinical Prioritization Module (CPM), which adaptively reweights input modalities based on clinical importance, enhancing both interpretability and diagnostic robustness.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses early-stage PD diagnosis, an important yet challenging problem where early detection can greatly improve patient outcomes.
- The introduction of the Clinical Prioritization Module (CPM) is an original idea that combines clinical interpretability with neural network attention mechanisms.
- The visualization of attention maps and correlation with Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores offers interpretable, clinically meaningful insights.
- The paper is well-written, logically structured, and provides detailed dataset and training configurations.

### Weaknesses
- While the CPM is intuitive, the paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis explaining why the prioritization weights converge to clinically meaningful values.
- The paper primarily evaluates performance on datasets collected under controlled conditions. Validation on real-world or hospital deployment data would improve credibility.
- Although the authors claim PD Diag-Net is lightweight, the paper does not provide quantitative comparisons of runtime or parameter efficiency relative to baselines.

### Questions
- How were the clinical importance weights in the CPM initialized? Were they learned from scratch or pre-specified based on domain knowledge?
- Can the authors quantify how interpretability correlates with diagnostic accuracy, e.g., does higher CPM attention to motor features align with improved F1-score?
- Can the authors provide qualitative examples or case studies showing CPM’s prioritization in early vs. advanced PD patients?

### Summary
This paper proposes PD-Diag-Net, an end-to-end framework for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) from raw T1-weighted MRI scans. PD-Diag-Net incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior, which assigns weights to brain regions based on their association with PD, and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior, which leverages accelerated aging patterns in PD-affected brain regions. The framework offers three modules: an MRI preprocessing module using established tools (HD-BET, ANTs), a relevance-prior guided feature aggregation module, and an aging-prior guided diagnosis module. The authors report strong performances of 86.1% accuracy on external test data and 96.7% accuracy on prodromal (early-stage) PD cases.

### Strengths
* The paper addresses an important real-world clinical challenge of early PD detection from MRI, which offers some potential to reduce diagnostic time and improve patient outcomes.
* The choice to combine established clinical knowledge of brain anatomical contributions and aging priors is conceptually sound and offers interpretability on how the diagnosis is made.
* The authors provide a rigorous testing strategy with two large clinical datasets and an external subset holdout on a harder task to demonstrate generalizability.
* The 96.7% accuracy performance on early-stage PD cases (prodromal external test) is especially impressive and clinically valuable, if validated on more datasets and differential diagnostic tasks.
* The authors also show comprehensive ablation study results (Table 2) to highlight the contribution of each module, with significant performance drops observed up to 16% when removing specific modules that they contributed.
* The authors also detail experimental settings, data preprocessing, and more in the Appendix and offer to release the source code, which bodes well for encouraging reproducibility and extensions of this work.

### Weaknesses
* The authors claim prior works are heavily preprocessed, hence the novelty of the Processor module, but I am not exactly sure what the technical contribution is here. The Processor steps seem standard to most others (skull stripping, bias correction, normalization, etc.), save for swapping out the tool/algorithm. Recent works like DeepPrep (Nature Methods, 2025, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02599-1) use more sophisticated preprocessing via deep learning and GPU parallelization with confound regression, motion correction, and distortion correction, none of which are addressed here.
* The assigned clinical-prior weights of 1, 10^-2, and 10^-3 seem arbitrary. The authors state these are “based on clinical expertise,” but do not explain how (e.g., did a clinical expert offer these scores?). The referenced publication by Burciu et al. (line  198, page 4) is focused on the motor cortex, which is not prioritized as a prior/manifestation in this study. For example, Fig. 1(a) categorizes the insular cortex as “potentially associated” (10^-2 weight), yet growing literature findings (Jonkman et al., 2021; Fathy et al., 2019; Criaud et al, 2016) detail significant insular involvement in PD pathology. To mitigate questions about whether assignments were post-hoc fitted to improve performance, it would be helpful for the authors to include how (systematically/objectively) these weights were determined and assigned.
Perhaps I also missed this, but was any sensitivity analysis conducted for the weights, i.e., what happens with different initial weights? Would (1, 0.5, 0.1) work similarly? The three-order-of-magnitude difference seems extreme.
* The strength of novelty for ICLR is pretty weak, because the main things proposed were just standard methods (CNN for preprocessed T1w MRI), just different architectures or tools. The other components they proposed like regional-wise-pooling has also been done in the Brain GNNs space often, and it didn’t make sense why they pooled raw vs. learned features… the branching idea was different but is also essentially just separate encoders. The weights seemed like random numbers and were not justified.
* The authors showed .99 ROC AUC curve (which is impossible to achieve) in the Appendix but didn’t report AUC across all evaluated methods & they mentioned certain components essentially are driving prediction entirely or in a strange way, e.g., deriving their equations shows aging prior has majority signal in most cases so the imaging features are essentially not helpful at all, which is the primary claim for using MRI. 
* Would need further clarity on the novelty claims and addressing the potential aging confounder + metrics.

### Questions
* Equation 3 is confusing; the authors extract X_dense (learned features) but then pool raw MRI intensities (X_proc), which lack meaning at this stage, vs. learned. Why not apply pooling to Xdense?
* For X_up, how did you upsample 2 scalar values (mean and std from Eq. 5, X_agg) to match approximately C*23*27*23?
* The paper states, “Branch-2 utilizes an identical network architecture (with independently trained parameters)” (line 184, page 4). Why would age regression (1 output, continuous) and PD classification (2 outputs) need identical architectures?
AUC metric should be moved up to main metrics; also questionable in Fig. 9, which shows near-perfect separation with AUC = 0.9971 for normal internal test (this could be overfitting).
The ablation study (Table 2, page 8) shows that removing the aging prior drops accuracy from 86.1% to 77.2%, which is a 9% decrease that represents most of the improvement over baseline. Seeing as age is a known co-variate of PD (high risk factor, as most PD patients are older adults and have certain comorbidities aligned with aging), I question whether the model is simply predicting brain age instead of diagnosing PD? Authors even state that removing aging prior drives prediction probabilities down near chance (line 428-429, page 8).
Testing things out, given \alpha=1, \tau=4.5, a 10-year age gap shifts the PD logit by ~5.5, which could significantly affect a confident prediction. Why not learn the fusion weight here? 
It would be helpful if the authors could strengthen their argument against the perspective that the model could be learning age-related patterns that correlate with PD incidence rather than PD-specific pathology. For example, report age distributions for “PD vs. Others” groups, show performance stratified by age groups, and validate that brain age prediction in PD-associated regions differs from whole-brain age prediction.
* Why only aging as a “pathological” prior? What about established quantitative pathological markers like volumetric measures, structural measures like cortical thickness, or even functional connectivity, since the authors leverage a functional-based atlas?
* The ablation study also indicates that CNN features hurt performance (70.8% for CNN features only vs. 81.5% Regional pooling alone: 81.5% [+10.7% better!] vs. 86.1% for Combined [+4.6% improvement over pooling alone]). So, raw regional averages outperform learned features? I again raise the question of how and where X_dense is appropriately integrated into the framework.
* I find the Fig. 5 brain maps (page 9) somewhat uninformative. The three orthogonal slices of raw MRI for four outcomes add no interpretability without having MRI expertise. Since the model uses regional atlases, it would be more useful to visualize region-level importance scores, activation maps, or attention weights for interpretability. This could help answer which regions are driving prediction, and whether region-based contributions correlate with original weight assignments vs. learned weights.
* The hyperparameter values \zeta=9.5 and \tau=4.5 create a 5-year gap (9.5 - 4.5 = 5) between minimum PD and maximum non-PD age gaps. How were these tuned? Were these validated clinically?
Also, experiments are said to use five-fold CV(line 344, page 7), but only point estimate values are reported. Are these averaged? Standard deviations?
* Spelling/grammatical errors: “aggragated” should be “aggregated” (line 284, page 6); revise “In simple understanding” (line 316, page 6) to “In simple terms” or “Simply put”.

### Summary
This paper proposes PD-Diag-Net, an end-to-end MRI-based framework for early Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis that integrates two explicit clinical priors—(1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (PD-related region weighting via Harvard-Oxford Atlas) and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (age-gap regularization capturing accelerated regional aging). The system comprises three modules: MRI-Processor (HD-BET + ANTs for skull stripping, bias correction, registration), Relevance-Prior-Guided Aggregator (region pooling + weighted fusion), and Aging-Prior-Guided Diagnoser (dual-branch classification and age-gap constraint). Evaluated on multi-institutional MRI (PPMI + hospital) under internal, normal external, and prodromal external settings, it achieves 86.1% accuracy on external and 96.7% TPR in early PD, surpassing baselines (XAI, FCN-PD, S3D, AE-FLOW) by >20%. Ablation confirms necessity of each module (Processor +14%, Relevance-Prior +25%, Aging-Prior +9%). Despite high performance, the method mainly refines existing components rather than introducing fundamentally new ML theory. The work is clinically valuable, technically complete, and reproducible, but algorithmically incremental for ICLR.

### Strengths
Clinically important and well-motivated problem with strong real-world value.

Clear, complete three-module pipeline with transparent equations and figures.

Effective integration of explicit medical priors improving interpretability and robustness.

Multi-dataset experiments and ablations demonstrating high external validity.

Detailed implementation and reproducibility plan with public release intent.

### Weaknesses
[Major] Methodological originality appears limited, as the framework mainly combines established components (DenseNet backbone, HD-BET/ANTs preprocessing, region-wise pooling, and fixed prior weighting). While this integration is technically solid and clinically meaningful, the contribution lies more in careful system design and application than in introducing a fundamentally new algorithmic concept—positioning the work closer to the boundary of ICLR’s typical methodological focus.

Prior-guided loss is intuitive but not theoretically analyzed.

Fixed prior weights (1, 10⁻², 10⁻³) may introduce bias; no adaptive mechanism shown.

No sensitivity tests for prior or hyperparameter choices (Θ, ζ, τ).

Missing broader clinical metrics (AUC, differential diagnosis); ~20 % FPR not calibrated.

### Questions
What conceptual or algorithmic advance distinguishes this from prior region-weighted or age-informed CNNs?

How robust is performance to changes in Θ, ζ, τ or prior weighting schemes?

Can FPR be reduced through calibration or threshold adjustment for screening use?

Could this extend to multimodal or multi-class settings (e.g., PD vs MSA/PSP)?

When will the full code and data be publicly released for reproducibility?

Overall, the research direction is meaningful and the implementation is relatively complete.

### Strengths
This paper proposes PD-Diag-Net, which integrates two types of clinical priors into an MRI-based Parkinson’s disease diagnostic framework and achieves good performance on both internal and external datasets. Overall, the research direction is meaningful and the implementation is relatively complete.

### Weaknesses
1.The abstract and methodology sections describe the implementation of the Relevance-Prior and Aging-Prior, but do not sufficiently justify their uniqueness at the architectural or algorithmic level. Could the authors further clarify how these clinical priors are integrated into the network structure and what unique algorithmic or structural advantages they provide compared with existing methods, rather than being an engineering combination of modules?
2.The manuscript lacks a complete description of the dataset composition and partitioning strategy. Could the authors provide the specific numbers of PD and other neurological disorders samples in each dataset, the composition of different disease types within the other neurological disorders group, and the subject-level train/validation/test partitioning strategy to ensure fairness and transparency in data usage?

### Questions
1.The study does not include sensitivity analysis or statistical significance testing for key hyperparameters (such as brain-region prior weights and aging thresholds). Could the authors evaluate the model’s robustness under different hyperparameter settings and report uncertainty metrics to verify the reliability of the reported performance improvements?
2.Table 4 contains incomplete information, the second row shows only the citation “(Lee et al., 2022)” without the corresponding backbone name. Please correct the table and include the missing model name.
