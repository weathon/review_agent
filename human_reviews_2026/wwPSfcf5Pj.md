## Abstract
Gene expression prediction, which predicts mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences, presents significant challenges. Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, 
a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.

### Summary
This paper suggests that in the problem of gene expression prediction, sequence length may not be the key factor for prediction performances. Instead, leveraging epigenomic signals can better predict the gene expression.

### Strengths
- The idea itself is very interesting. While many works model DNA sequences to show off their long-sequence ability, modeling long sequences in DNA itself may not be helpful to many genomics related works. 
- The experiments are comprehensive to support the paper claims.

### Weaknesses
While the proposed $L_2$ objective is conceptually appealing, it is not fully clear how the model can learn meaningful confounder weights $a_i$ without any external supervision, but only based on epigenomic signals $S$. I can understand the performance gain from data augmentation perspective (e.g., to avoid overfit), but it’s not fully clear to me how the model can get the real confounder. Could the author elaborate it more clearly?

### Questions
The following points are intended as open discussions 
- Following the weakness part, how do the authors think that adding additional external information could help the model learn more interpretable confounder representations $a_i$? 
- The current analysis only focuses on one task: gene expression prediction. I wonder whether the authors think the same causal regularization principles could generalize to broader DNA signal modeling tasks?. Would the authors expect similar trends to hold in those settings?

### Summary
The paper challenges the dominant narrative that using models with longer DNA sequences improves gene expression prediction (e.g., Enformer,AlphaGenome). The authors show that relatively short sequence lengths are often sufficient to preserve most of the predictive performance. They demonstrate that multimodal epigenomic signals (such as histone modifications and chromatin accessibility) carry rich cell-type--specific information. However, naïve integration of these signals introduces confounding effects, as background chromatin patterns correlate with gene expression. To address this issue, the authors propose a causal framework that learns multiple background chromatin states and applies backdoor adjustment to isolate true causal effects of regulatory signals. The paper reports improved gene expression prediction performance in two of the most well-characterized cell lines, outperforming the models it builds upon, i.e. Caduceus and Seq2Exp.

### Strengths
The paper presents a clear and well-supported argument that genomic sequence models do not significantly benefit from longer input sequences, a strong claim that is convincingly demonstrated through extensive experimentation (specifically Table 12). The results showing the impact of epigenetic markers are compelling and supported by thorough ablation studies that highlight the individual contribution of each signal type. The analysis of the confounding effect is insightful, and the proposed solution using backdoor adjustment is both conceptually well-suited to the biological problem, offering a principled way to disentangle causal relationships from spurious correlations.

### Weaknesses
My concerns regarding the efficiency of the proposed approach. As shown in the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis (Section 4.3), the variation in performance when tuning the parameters \alpha and \beta appears minimal, suggesting limited sensitivity to these design choices. Similarly, the number of background states n has only a minor impact on results, as even the case n=0 in Table 2a performs comparably well. This raises questions about how essential the proposed causal intervention mechanism truly is for achieving the reported improvements.

### Questions
- In the experimentation in Table 1, it is not clear to me the length of the sequences the model is using when computing the results in each row. Is Prism using a smaller genome sequence length when surpassing the SOTA models?

### Summary
**Problem (P)**

The paper is motivated by the issues that arises during multi-modal long-context genomic modelling. Specifically,  
1. said models merely mitigate the performance degradation inherent in current long-sequence modelling paradigms. They do not fix it. Figure 1 d shows this. 
2. the epigenomic signals are interdependent and play different roles. Naive modelling, with all of the signals, may render the model to learn spurious relations, the effects of which are demonstrated in figure 1 e/f.

**Solution (S)**

To mitigate the confounding effects Prism is introduced, an approach that: 
1. learns high-dimensional feature combinations to represent background chromatin states, and 
2. makes a prediction for each state and averages them (backdoor adjustment) to reduce confounding. Training uses three losses: prediction, intervention (on the averaged prediction), and a uniformity loss that promotes diversity in the learned weights.

**Contributions (C)**
1. The authors challenge the focus on long-sequence modeling for gene expression, showing it does not necessarily help with current tools. 
2. They analyze roles of signals and point out that background chromatin patterns can confound models.
3. Introduce and evaluate Prism. The new method beats all baselines while operating at a 2kbp genomic context, while most baselines utilise 200kbp.

**Experimental Setting (E)**

1. Inputs: DNA sequence, sequence-wide H3K27ac, Hi-C, and DNase-seq data. 
2. Baselines: Enformer, HyenaDNA, Mamba, Caduceus, EPInformer, Seq2Exp (hard and soft), Caduceus w/ signals, and MACS3 variant.
3. Metrics: MSE, MAE, Pearson.

### Strengths
1. Clear motivation **P**. The paper picks upon a prevalent issue in long-context DNA sequence modelling. The authors narrow down on the key-issue and validate it experimentally. 
2. Within gene expression prediction, using latent background-state weights + uniform backdoor averaging is relatively novel.
3. While most baselines are trained and reported at 200k bp, Prism runs at 2k bp and still beats prior SOTA (Table 1). This supports their claim that better multi-modal integration can offset long-context modelling.
4. Ample baselines are explored and the evaluation metrics seem fine.

### Weaknesses
1. Prism completely discards long-range sequence information by design, operating on only 2kbp. This is presented as a strength, but I believe that this is also a fundamental limitation. The model cannot discover regulatory elements or sequence variations beyond its 2kbp window unless their effects are already captured by the provided proximal epigenomic signals. Have the authors explored how the metrics change when we increase the context? Why was 2k chosen?

2. Results in Table 1 are based on only two human cell lines, K562 and GM12878. While these are standard benchmarks, gene regulation is notoriously complex and cell-type specific. The model's SOTA performance may not hold across a wider, more diverse set of cell types or tissues. With the current breadth of exploration I feel that the proposed method has a limited experimental scope.

### Summary
This paper introduces Prism, a framework that accounts for the effects of confounders in epigenomic signals when predicting gene expression.  Specifically, it employs a three-layer 1D CNN as the confounder encoder, which processes the epigenomic signals to generate a set of confounder weight vectors.  In parallel, a single linear layer serves as the signal encoder, producing the corresponding signal weights. These two components are then combined, together with the DNA sequence features, to predict gene expression levels.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of confounder components for the gene expression prediction and their connection to biological intuition is important.
As it completes the current casual relationship formulation of the epigenomic signal.

2. The observation regarding the sequence length required for CAGE prediction is interesting and biologically reasonable. 
The provided experiments support such observation on the K562 cell for Gene Expression CAGE Prediction.
I still have some doubts about whether a shorter sequence length is universally applicable to gene expression prediction tasks, or if it is specific to the datasets used in this study.
In other words, does 2k sequence is enough for all the gene expression prediction tasks beyond Gene Expression CAGE Prediction on the K562 and GM12878 cell?
If not, how to select the suitable length for diverse task?

3. The experimental results looks good with the introduction of the confounder components. Overall, the paper writing is clear.

### Weaknesses
The overall framework appears well designed and complete, and I have no further comments regarding potential improvements.
My remaining concern lies in how to determine the appropriate sequence length for different prediction tasks. 
Furthermore, if the goal is to train a unified model for general gene expression prediction, it would be helpful to clarify how the model can adapt to varying sequence length requirements across different genes or datasets.
