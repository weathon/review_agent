## Abstract
Exoskeletons show great promise for enhancing mobility, but providing appropriate assistance remains challenging due to the complexity of human adaptation to external forces. Current state-of-the-art approaches for optimizing exoskeleton controllers require extensive human experiments in which participants must walk for hours, creating a paradox: those who could benefit most from exoskeleton assistance, such as individuals with mobility impairments, are rarely able to participate in such demanding procedures. We present Exo-plore, a simulation framework that combines neuromechanical simulation with deep reinforcement learning to optimize hip exoskeleton assistance without requiring real human experiments. Exo-plore can (1) generate realistic gait data that captures human adaptation to assistive forces, (2) produce reliable optimization results despite the stochastic nature of human gait, and (3) generalize to pathological gaits, showing strong linear relationships between pathology severity and optimal assistance.

### Summary
This paper proposes Exo-plore, a simulation pipeline to optimize exoskeleton controller parameters without real human experiments. In Exo-plore, the authors train a gait generator to generate gait trajectories with exoskeleton assistance. Then they train a surrogate model with the generated gait data under a set of controller parameters sampled by Latin hypercube. The final control parameter is selected by optimizing over the surrogate model. The experimental results demonstrate the qualitative fidelity of the gait generator in both joint and muscle levels compared with real human experiments, and the optimization results in both healthy and disable conditions.

### Strengths
1. This paper aims at conducting exoskeleton control optimization in pure simulation with biomechanical fidelity by using a musculoskeletal-based controller, which is well motivated and will benefit safer and more efficient assisted control optimization.

2. The experimental results is comprehensive with video demonstration, which demonstrate the qualitative fidelity of the gait generator and the optimized controller parameters. The limitations are also mentioned.

### Weaknesses
1. From the text description and Figure 1, the whole optimization pipeline seems not a closed-loop. During the training of the gait generator, the model is fit to a certain control parameter by maximizing $r_{HEI}$. This control parameter is not optimized. When training the surrogate model, different control parameters are fed to the gait generator to get gait data. I think the data collection pipeline is unreasonable to me, because control parameters sampled by Latin hypercube are not in the training distribution of gait generator, which may lead to lower $R_{HEI}$ and unknown gait generating performance. 

2. Algorithm 1 seems very time-consuming, which requires whole training round of gait generator for each reward parameters.

3. The reward and loss terms in e.q. (2), (3), (4), (7) have many hyperparameters. It may be hard to determine these hyperparameters without real human experimental data. It may not be practical to apply the proposed method in pure simulation.

4. According to Figure 8 (b)-(d), the trained surrogate model seems sensitive to the weight of gradient penalty loss, where the optimized control parameters have distinct discrepancy. The "smooth landscape" shown by the fitted surrogate model might also be accessed by Gaussian process with much fewer data under proper kernel function.

5. (Minor) The writing can be further improved to be clearer. e,g. (1) In Algorithm 1 and 3, There is no formal definition of "trainDataGenerator" and "EvalCoT" in the main text. (2) In line 390: there is no formal introduction of $r_{assist}$.

### Questions
1. In Algorithm 1, how many candidates $(\alpha, \beta)$ are evaluated during experiment?  What is the training time of a single round of gaite generator training?

2. In Algorithm 2, how many available $(L, f)$ are evaluated?

3.  How to set the hyperparameters of the defined reward and loss functions in practice?

4. Do the body parameters of the used musculoskeletal model match the human with real experimental data (e.g. height and weight)?

5. The whole optimization problem is a 2d black box optimization problem, where GP-based Bayesian optimization can usually converge within 100 samples even under noisy function evaluation. Why did you generate over 60k data to train a surrogate model in Appendix D.2? I think this amount of data is sufficient to delineate a 2d function landscape without any further surrogate fitting.

### Summary
The paper presents a very advanced simulative biomechanical model, called Exo-plore, to study lower limb gait kinematics, kinetics, and muscular activity. Exo-plore allows to simulate also wearable assistive devices such as a hip assistive exoskeleton integrated with the biomechanical model. This allows to study more advanced control strategies for wearable systems. The simulation framework is benchmarked against actual human experimental data showing promising result. The work is novel, well presented, and relevant.
I would greatly appreciate a better quantification of the differences between simulated and experimental results and a more insightful evaluation of such discrepancies. I honestly believe those difference could elucidate not only the simulative environment limitations but also show some potentially interesting biomechanical features of motor control.

### Strengths
1. The Exo-plore simulation-based framework represents a notable step forward in the development of biomechanical simulation environments that reduce the sim2real gap. The framework demonstrated promising results when benchmarked against experimental data despite the complexity of the musculoskeletal system.

2. The possibility to simulate assistive devices in combination with biomechanical models is also another promising result. Fine-tuning exoskeletal control parameters is often hard, and Exo-plore might help developing faster and more reliable controllers.

2. I find convincing the definition of the total reward, and I especially appreciate the level of detail and reasoning behind it. Often times, papers neglect the proper presentation of the rationale behind the reward function. However, reward shaping is fundamental and has a very-well known impact on the performance of learning algorithms.

3. The idea of the resistance-minimization hypothesis is compelling and somehow novel in this context. I found this a strength of the proposed work, which differentiates it from the state-of-the-art.

4, The paper is clearly presented, and it provides a significant step forward in the development of realistic lower-limb musculoskeletal models capable to reproduce multiple gait patterns and different assistive scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1. Authors could improve the literature on human-in-the-loop optimization for exoskeletons. The group of Prof. Elliott Rouse at the U. Michigan has done extensive work on the topic on both prostheses and exoskeletons, but I could only find 1 work from his group in your references. Consider extending your literature review and include also this relevant portion of literature.

2. In neuromechanical simulations, authors should briefly mention the fact that Hill-type muscle actuators are an approximation of the actual muscle behavior. More specifically, Hill never designed the muscle model to be used for complex musculoskeletal models but only to investigate the force-speed relationship in human individual muscles. As a consequence, many other features of muscle dynamics are not captured by it. Nonetheless, most musculoskeletal models employ Hill-type muscle models ''carelessly'' believing that it gives a complete representation of human behavior. This aspect can lead users of such models to incorrect insights on the actual human musculoskeletal system.
Please consider mentioning this aspect in your digression.

3. It would be nice if you could provide some measure of similarity (or distance) between the simulated and experimental behaviors - both at the joint and muscular level, as well as for the other results presented in the paper. For join trajectories, I agree that the hip internal rotation is the one presenting the largest difference, while the other joint angular trajectories are closer to the behavior of human subjects. Nonetheless, some differences might be physiologically relevant. For example, in Figure 2 - Knee Flexion panel, you can observe that the simulation generates: (i) an overall smaller knee flexion peak during swing, and (ii) a practically negligible knee flexion during stance. Why is that? The knee flexion peak during swing is fundamental in normal walking to reduce the risk of stumbling and potentially falling, while the knee flexion peak during stance is important for shock absorption purposes. Is there any insight on why the model is not able to capture these features? Analogous observations could be done for the ankle dorsiflexion or hip abduction. I would greatly appreciate if you could comment more extensively on these results. (Similar comments are reported in the Questions also for Figure 5).

### Questions
1. Is metabolic rate efficiency i.e., energy efficiency, the 'holy grail' of gait? Most of the existing research focuses on developing lower-limb exoskeletons that lower metabolic cost. However, humans do not always plan for most efficient behavior. It might be worth discussing this aspect in the paper. I also recommend having a look at this interesting (and recent paper): https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-023-00091-2

2. Equation (1) is clear but I struggle to understand why you apply a torque proportional to the difference in sine of the hip angles? Why not applying a torque proportional to the actual difference between the angles? What's the need of the sine function? Moreover, 'k' has the dimensions of a stiffness, thus making your controller equivalent to an impedance control system. Is that correct? If so, I would mention it.
Last but not least, delayed-feedback control can become unstable. Have you considered this aspect?

3. While I understand the need to have an overall goal for the optimizer, why do most papers focus on metabolic cost minimization? Is this the actual human underlying goal during walking/gait? I think this is a non-trivial question. I don't expect you to answer quantitatively to this point - but it might be beneficial to specify somewhere that the metabolic cost minimization is only one of the possible goals of walking/gait, but other goals might exist.

4. In Figure 4, the step frequency and step length results are also interesting. I invite the authors to compute any form of error, similarity or distance metric between experimental and simulated results. I agree the similarity is good, but I also wonder what the discrepancies are telling us. For example, we can observe that the simulations present the best fit at 4 km/h, while they tend to diverge at the extremes (either higher or lower). Why is that? Is this a bias of the training or is this an indicator that some other aspects of the musculoskeletal system need to be included? (Also, but a minor point, the font of the plot labels (in most figures) is very small - can you slightly increase it?)

5. In page 7, line 377, you write (k,\Delta_t) = (8 Nm, 0.25s). But wouldn't 'k' represent physically a stiffness i.e., its unit of measurement shouldn't it be Nm/rad?

6. You write that the overall trends in Figure 5 match reasonably well between simulation and human subjects, and this is true especially for the exo assist moment. However, if we look at the hip flexion angle we observe that the simulation does not capture the fact that at the increase of the walking speed the hip flexion angle presents a left-shift. Why isn't the simulation capturing this? Is this something the simulation can or cannot capture? What is the source of this dissimilarity? 
Moreover, the overall exo assist power is underestimated (in the simulation) by almost a factor of 4 or even 5 at times. Why is this happening? Furthermore, why did you not compute any form of similarity metric between experimental and simulated results?

7. Lines 388-389, there are two small typos: (i) "an downward-opening" should be "a downward-opening", (ii) "a upward-opening" should be "an upward-opening".

8. Line 978-979. Can you clarify why do you need to add a minimum mass constraint to stabilize the simulation? This aspect is unclear.

9. Table I.4. Please see my previous comment on the unit of measurement of ‘k’. Shouldn’t that be a stiffness? If not, please explain why.

10. Line 1121-1122. I believe there is a typo in the title of section M. Shouldn’t it be “Reduction” and not “Recution”?

### Summary
A neuro-mechanical simulation framework is presented which generates realistic gaits for not just able-bodied humans but also for certain pathological conditions. These gait simulations are generated using deep reinforcement learning with a novel reward term that captures the human-exoskeleton interaction. Further, a surrogate network trained from simulation data gathered from the gait generator, estimates a differentiable cost of transport. A gradient based optimizer then consumes the outputs of the surrogate network to compute optimal exoskeleton control parameters given certain gait parameters.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and organized. The problem is well motivated by the authors who position it well among existing literature. Bridging the gap between neuromuscular simulation and reality is a highly relevant open problem in robotics. 

The paper also presents interesting formulations - The novel reward term r_{hei} for training the generative GaitNet, intra-muscular regularizer in the loss term to learn Muscle Coordination Network, and the Surrogate Network which estimates cost of transport from simulated data are technically sound ideas and the results and ablation studies around these terms show their benefit very clearly. 

The paper presents convincing and thorough results across the board - the gait kinematics with and without assistance, optimal exoskeleton gain values for disabled individuals, The Cost of transport landscape are explained thoroughly. The ablation studies around the requirement for the r_{hei} reward term are also extremely useful for the reader to understand the necessity of adding this term to model human-exoskeleton interaction. 

In my opinion one of the bigger strengths of the paper are a few insightful discussions presented in the paper that pose very valid questions about the gap in simulation and reality with neuromuscular systems and potentially inspire future research - A few examples are -  
In figure 4, RL policy has difficulty producing short step lengths due to the rigid body dynamics and unwanted collisions. 
In appendix K and figure K.6, the over activation of Rectus femoris because of reduced cost of transport compared to real humans. 
In appendix N, The results indicate that effective exoskeleton prescription depends on not just pathological severity but also the underlying trade off between stability and energy specific to each biomechanical adaptation is a great insight.

### Weaknesses
As the authors themselves acknowledge, while the results here show promise in closing the sim-2-real gap in neuro-mechanical simulation, the ultimate test is how well this actually works in real world testing, which is still missing. So, a question still remains as to how effective the proposed methodology is? But this does not take away the good work and its contributions in this paper.

Small observations - 
In equation 16, it's not clear what M and n stand here. There are a lot of variables described in this paper, it would be great to have a table that summarizes every variable. 

In appendix A, It's not clear where this M_{ref} is obtained from. Also, the policy architecture optimized using PPO is not mentioned anywhere in the paper. It might actually be useful to include learning curves and details of the PPO training  in the appendix for the benefit of anyone trying to reproduce this paper.

### Questions
1) It's not clear how accurate the gait patterns are for pathological conditions as they are compared with normal gaits (figure J5) and not with real human data with the same pathological condition, is the issue here the lack of biomechanical data? 

2) In figure 2, comparison of joint kinematics in simulation - How does the anthropomorphic data such as height and weight of the model (169 cm, 72.9 kg) compare with the real human data?

3) In the videos, the arm motion does not look like natural human motion at all, how much impact does that have on lower-body kinetics? 

4) Lastly, I’m curious about the ground reaction forces in a gait cycle. Do they match biomechanics data? These might also be a great indication for how close these simulations are compared to reality. The contact forces would depend on how the contact dynamics is modeled, which might also explain some observations in the gait kinematics.

### Summary
The paper introduces a neuromechanical simulation framework that couples a Deep RL–driven gait generator with a stochasticity‑aware surrogate optimizer to select hip‑exoskeleton control parameters, specifically a gain without human-in-the-loop experiments. Core ingredients are: (i) a gait data generator (PoseNet + PD control + a Muscle Coordination Network) trained with a composite reward that blends energy minimization and a human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) term; and (ii) a surrogate network trained on simulated datasets.

### Strengths
- Clear problem framing and a convincing argument for simulation‑first controller selection when HILO is impractical. (Intro; Fig. 1.)
- Well engineered pipeline (PoseNet/MCN/IMR; LHS + Huber + gradient penalty) with thoughtful ablations and appendices documenting design choices. (Method; Appendix B, D-G).
- Clinically relevant analysis of pathological gaits

### Weaknesses
- The paper’s scope seems more suitable to a robotics or rehabilitation venue than here. While applications to a particular domain, such as, rehabilitation and robotics are a perfect fit for this venue, the core of this work lies primarily in the exoskeleton control and simulation framework rather than in a methodological advance in/applying deep learning itself.

- Fitting (α,β) to match the human CoT-speed parabola incorporates experimental behavior into the simulator (Algorithm 1–2). This aids realism but complicates claims of prediction vs post‑hoc alignment. 

- The HEI term is explicitly engineered to reproduce delay/power scaling observed in data (Fig. 6–7). This is practical, but it risks a form of “trend imitation.” Evidence that other experimentally reported adaptations (not used in shaping) also emerge would clarify generality.

- The surrogate approach is compared mainly to GP‑capacity limits (Appendix D). Modern scalable GP approximations (e.g., inducing points) or kernel ridge with random features would be useful baselines. 

- I missed comparison to other controllers ( e.g., the 2‑parameter delayed‑feedback controller to a phase‑based profile with 3–5 parameters)

### Questions
- How sensitive are optimized (κ,Δt) to the HEI scaling in Eq. (6)? Would normalizing by peak positive device power or by COM mechanical work be more robust across gains?

- Did you test parameterizations where Δt is specified in phase (as a fraction of gait cycle) rather than time, to reduce speed dependence and does the optimizer still recover the same pattern seen in Fig. 8d?
