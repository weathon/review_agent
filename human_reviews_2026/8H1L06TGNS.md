## Abstract
Inferring dynamics from population snapshots is a core challenge in machine learning and biology. In scRNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), destructive measurements yield irregular, high-dimensional samples of cell states, obscuring how populations evolve. Existing trajectory inference methods either use graph heuristics or cast alignment as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem. However, they treat cells as independent points, ignoring intercellular interactions. 
In this work, we ask whether incorporating cell–cell interactions can improve the reconstruction of cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots. We introduce IADOT  (Interaction-Aware Dynamic Optimal Transport), which integrates cell-cell interaction networks into an OT objective and then learns a time-continuous vector field via Conditional Flow Matching. Across a synthetic task and diverse scRNA-seq datasets, we find that incorporating interaction structure can improve snapshot alignment and inference of cellular dynamics versus feature-only baselines. IADOT also supports in-silico ligand–receptor perturbation analyses: we show on lung cancer data that inferred trajectories are sensitive to edits of the ligand–receptor catalog, consistent with known effects of targeted pathway inhibition.

### Summary
This paper proposes IADOT, a two-stage pipeline for inferring cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots by (i) computing a structure-aware cross-snapshot coupling with a Fused Gromov–Wasserstein (FGW) objective that combines expression distances with a cell–cell interaction (CCI) prior derived from ligand–receptor (LR) expression, and (ii) fitting a time-dependent velocity field with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) induced by the coupling. Empirically, the authors report lower interpolation errors (W1/W2) on several datasets and demonstrate in-silico LR catalog edits that decrease a tumour progression proxy.

### Strengths
1. Well-presented formulation. The paper is explicit about (a) constructing CCI tensors from LR expressions and (b) inserting them into an FGW objective; then converting a coupling into a continuous flow via CFM. This makes the pipeline replicable.  
2. Simple prior to enabling sensitivity tests. Because structure enters as an explicit prior (CCI tensor, α), the paper can perform catalog-edit counterfactuals and quantify effects on a progression proxy.  
3. This problem is important.

### Weaknesses
1. **Scope and novelty**. This method can be viewed as substituting the feature-only OT coupling commonly used in CFM-style trajectories with an FGW coupling that incorporates a CCI term, and then fitting dynamics via standard CFM on the resulting affine interpolants. The paper does not seem to introduce a new dynamic objective beyond this substitution, and the theoretical discussion primarily shows that CFM reproduces the coupling-induced linear path rather than establishing guarantees for transporting the empirical endpoints under a broader dynamic optimality principle for FGWOT. Making explicit what is (and is not) guaranteed would strengthen the positioning. From this perspective, the technical contributions are incremental. “Interaction-aware” is implemented as a generic FGW structure term, not a CCI-specific dynamic model. The framework turns LR information into static multi-channel adjacency and then optimizes a generic FGW objective; this idea is not specific to CCIs—any typed graph prior could be dropped in. Similar ideas have also been presented in Moscot and many spatial OT alignment methods.
2. **Static CCI assumption** The method constructs snapshot-wise static tensors and encourages their cross-snapshot persistence, yet cellular neighborhoods and communication partners typically reconfigure between times. The static-graph prior may bias trajectories when transient interactions matter.  
3. **Sensitivity to CCI false positives.** Single-cell LR-based CCIs may contain a high rate of false positives. The sensitivity analysis (Table 3) shows that shuffling CCIs or using random LR catalogs could change interpolation performance, which may suggest some dependence on the specified CCI structure and could be influenced by the CCI false positives. 
4. **Computational cost and parameter selection.** The method introduces several hyperparameters—most notably the trade-off weight $\alpha$ between feature and structure terms, and Hill-function parameters $K_g$, $h_g$—whose values are chosen empirically by grid search on interpolation metrics. The paper does not provide principled guidance or sensitivity analysis for these settings. Moreover, the FGW solver and subsequent CFM training add considerable runtime and memory overhead.
5. **Lack of unbalanced and stochastic modeling.** The proposed framework assumes balanced mass transport and deterministic dynamics, yet biological systems often involve cell proliferation, death, and stochastic transcriptional noise. Ignoring unbalanced or stochastic components limits the model’s biological realism and comparability to Schrödinger Bridge or unbalanced OT (UOT) formulations, which explicitly capture mass creation or diffusion effects.

### Questions
1. **Clarity of theoretical contribution** The dynamic formulation appears to reuse the standard Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective with an FGW coupling that includes CCI information. Could the authors clarify what theoretical advances this introduces beyond substituting the coupling step? In particular, does the proposed FGWOT formulation guarantee valid optimal transport of endpoint distributions? If so, could the authors formally state and prove it?
2. **Specificity of “interaction-aware” modeling** Since the FGW structure term could accept any typed graph prior, to what extent is the method specific to cell–cell interactions rather than general structured alignment?
3. **Static CCI assumption** The model constructs snapshot-specific static CCI tensors and enforces persistence across time, but cellular communication networks typically reconfigure dynamically. Could the authors discuss how this static assumption affects trajectories when transient or time-varying interactions are present?
4. **Sensitivity to CCI noise** Given that single-cell LR-based CCIs often contain false positives, Table 3 suggests that interpolation quality changes when CCIs are shuffled or randomized. How robust is the method to such noise in the LR catalog, and could uncertainty propagation or perturbation analysis be added to quantify sensitivity?
5. **Computational cost and hyperparameter robustness** The approach relies on several empirically tuned parameters (e.g., $\alpha$, $K_g$, $h_g$) and involves a computationally intensive FGW solver. Could the authors report runtime, memory scaling, and parameter sensitivity, or discuss practical guidelines for applying the method to larger atlas-level datasets?
6. **Perturbation design** The in-silico perturbation experiment modifies only the CCI matrix (by removing selected LR pairs) while keeping expression data fixed. Is this design biologically justified? Would jointly perturbing expression or signaling outputs yield different dynamics, and how robust are the current results to that modeling choice?

My comments are based on my current understanding. At this stage, I find it difficult to be more positive, but I would be happy to reconsider my evaluation if the authors provide a thorough and convincing rebuttal addressing these points.

### Summary
This paper presents IADOT, a method for inferring cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq snapshots by incorporating cell-cell interaction (CCI) networks into the computation of OT couplings. The authors propose a multi-channel Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) objective to find a coupling that balances gene expression similarity and the preservation of CCI structure. This coupling is then used to train a continuous-time velocity field via Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). IADOT is benchmarked on synthetic data and multiple real scRNA-seq datasets, indicating that incorporating CCI information improves the accuracy of trajectory inference.

### Strengths
- Inferring trajectories from snapshot data is important in single cell biology.
- The paper moves beyond the common and limiting assumption of treating cells as independent particles in OT-based trajectory inference.
- The paper is well written in general, with comprehensive analysis under different experimental settings.

### Weaknesses
- From a technical perspective, this paper provides limited novelty in the OT formulation. **The application of GW/FGW-OT in single-cell trajectory inference is not new.** Apart from several works the authors already cited, moslin[1] also uses FGW-OT in the trajectory inference task. The difference lies in the specific biological priors, not the methodology itself.
- Directly using CFM to construct dynamic trajectories is also not novel. Here the dynamic paths are constructed using linear interpolation. However, if the population of cells is truly considered as an interacting system, then the trajectory of one cell will be influenced by others. Thus, the linear interpolation is questionable, as **it still considers each cell as an independent particle by enforcing straight lines.** Moreover, as the constraints of CCI patterns are only applied at endpoints, it is also questionable **whether these patterns can be preserved along the whole interpolated trajectories.**
- From a biological perspective, the CCI matrix is constructed from dissociated single-cell data, which removes the spatial context. In biological tissues, cells typically communicate within a local neighborhood. By ignoring spatial proximity, the method is likely to infer a large number of **false positive interactions** between cells that would never be in contact in vivo. This raises concerns about whether the CCI prior being used is biologically meaningful.
- From an empirical perspective, the improvement of incorporating CCI information in real world datasets is marginal, and seems to be **sensitive to different $\alpha$ across different datasets.** The authors should provide a clear guideline for selecting $\alpha$ on new datasets and report the computational cost required for this tuning process.
- The connection between results in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 is unclear. Are 'V1 Light' in Figure 4 (which is not mentioned in Table 6) and 'V1 Cortex' in Table 2 the same dataset? If so, the results seem to be inconsistent, as $\alpha=1$ yields the best performance in Table 2, while it exhibits the worst performance in Figure 4. If not, I recommend keeping the benchmarking datasets the same throughout the paper.
- The authors should consider more recent flow-matching baselines, such as Metric FM[2].
- The definitions of different properties in Table 1 should be introduced to ensure a fair comparison of different methods.

### Questions
Following the above weaknesses, the authors should make the following revisions before it can be considered for a favorable evaluation:
 - Justify the usage of linear interpolation to generate dynamic trajectories of interacting cells.
 - Justify the biological validity of the constructed CCI matrix, particularly the issue of potential false positives arising from the lack of spatial constraints.
 - Provide guidelines and computational cost for selecting $\alpha$.
 - Clarify the connection between Figure 4 and Table 2.
 - Incorporate more recent baselines.
 - Clarify the proposed properties in Table 1.

### Summary
This paper introduces **IADOT (Interaction-Aware Dynamic Optimal Transport)**, a framework that incorporates cell–cell interaction (CCI) structure into optimal transport–based trajectory inference for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The method extends Fused Gromov–Wasserstein optimal transport by integrating *directed, typed ligand–receptor networks* as a structural prior, encouraging couplings that preserve biologically meaningful communication patterns across timepoints. Using these structure-aware couplings, the authors then learn continuous-time dynamics via Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). 

Empirically, IADOT is evaluated on synthetic and real scRNA-seq datasets across different tissues, demonstrating that incorporating CCIs improves both cross-snapshot alignment and temporal interpolation compared to feature-only OT-CFM. The authors also perform in-silico perturbation analyses, showing biologically consistent trajectory shifts under ligand–receptor catalog edits. Overall, results support that interaction-aware priors can refine dynamic modelling of cellular systems.

### Strengths
1. **Well-motivated problem** - The paper tackles a significant and well-motivated problem. Standard OT-based trajectory inference methods often treat cells as independent data points, ignoring the rich biological context of cell-cell communication, which is a known driver of cellular dynamics.
2. **Clear validation of hypothesis** - The central hypothesis, that incorporating a CCI-based inductive bias can improve alignment over lack of this prior, is clearly validated.

### Weaknesses
1. **Limited technical novelty** - The core components: Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) are existing methods. The main contribution is the application of FGW to use directed, multi-typed LR interaction tensors*as the structural prior. While effective, this is a relatively straightforward extension of prior work.
2. **Omission of unbalanced optimal transport** - The paper's formulation relies on standard, balanced OT, which assumes conserved mass and does not account for cell proliferation or death. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the discussion, but given the incremental nature of the technical contribution, incorporating an unbalanced OT (UOT) formulation (e.g., as in UOT-FM [1] or VGFM [4]) seems within scope and would have significantly strengthened the paper.
3. **Incomplete positioning and outdated baselines** -  The paper's related work misses several relevant, recent methods that also incorporate various inductive biases into OT/flow-based trajectory models. For instance, the authors do not compare against methods that model geometric biases (MIOFlow [2], Metric FM [3]) or explicitly model cellular growth (VGFM [4]). The chosen baselines, TrajectoryNet and DSB, are now outdated given newer OT-based dynamic models that incorporate unbalanced or geometric regularization. A paper would benefit from positioning and comparison to more recent and competitive methods [1, 2, 3, 4] to observe the impact of different priors.

### Questions
1.  Given the rapid development in flow-based generative models for single-cell dynamics, why were more recent and relevant baselines (e.g., UOT-FM [1], MIOFlow [2], Metric FM [3], VGFM [4]) omitted in favour of older methods like TrajectoryNet and DSB?
2.  The authors correctly identify that the balanced OT formulation is a limitation for modeling systems with proliferation and death. Could the authors comment on the technical difficulty of extending IADOT to an unbalanced setting (e.g., using an unbalanced FGW objective)?

### Summary
The paper proposes IADOT, an interaction-aware optimal transport (OT) coupling that augments the Fused Gromov–Wasserstein (FGW) objective with cell–cell interaction (CCI) priors derived from ligand–receptor (LR) expression. The resulting coupling is used within a conditional flow matching (CFM) algorithm to learn continuous-time single-cell dynamics. Experiments span synthetic data and several scRNA-seq datasets.

### Strengths
* **Motivation**: The problem of solving trajectory inference in single-cell data and learning evolving dynamics in cells is strongly motivated in introduction and through main text. Authors highlight need for this line of work and challenges such as noise, sparsity, ill-one-to-one mappings due to unbalanced distributions and beyond.
* **Quality**: The need for a structure-aware interaction coupling is argued clearly, and the FGW extension is conceptually coherent.
* **Interpretability**: IADOT uses real-world biological priors such as ligand-receptor expressions to construct its CCI network

### Weaknesses
* **Baselines**: The authors propose formulating trajectory inference problem as learning dynamics in interacting subsystems. This is very similar to the work done in [1] and [2] where where similar setting of cell-cell interactions is considered, as well as some more recent work on modeling single-cell dynamics such as [3]. These should at least be discussed in Related Work and, ideally, included as empirical baselines (*see references in the questions section*).
* **Quality of LR expressions**: Quality of coupling depends on the quality of fed LR expressions. I would suggest authors to perform sensitivity analysis to test this relationship.

### Questions
* What is the computational cost of IADOT vs. OT-based coupling and other baselines? 
* In section 5.6 authors demonstrate that CCI persistence assumption fails to outperform OT-based methods due to rapidly changing development. In which cases is IADOT applicable? It would be good to provide analysis on whether [1] and [2] have similar limitations when modeling embryo data
* Have you tried applying IADOT in stochastic setting by constructing a stochastic bridge given the noise levels in single-cell data?
* Have you tried combining IADOT with other FM paradigms such as [3] instead of optimal transport coupling?
