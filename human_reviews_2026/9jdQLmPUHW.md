- Decision: Accept (Oral)
- Scores: 4, 8, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
Graph clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, aiming at grouping nodes with similar characteristics in the graph into clusters. This problem has been widely explored using graph neural networks (GNNs) due to their ability to leverage node attributes and graph topology for effective cluster assignments. However, representations learned through GNNs typically struggle to capture global relationships between nodes via local message-passing mechanisms. Moreover, the redundancy and noise inherently present in graph data may easily result in node representations lacking compactness and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a conjoint framework CoCo, which captures compactness and consistency in the learned node representations for deep graph clustering. Technically, our CoCo leverages graph convolutional filters to learn robust node representations from both local and global views, and then encodes them into low-rank compact embeddings, thus effectively removing the redundancy and noise as well as uncovering the intrinsic underlying structure. To further enrich the node semantics, we develop a consistency learning strategy based on compact embeddings to facilitate knowledge transfer from the two perspectives. Our experimental results indicate that our CoCo outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts on various datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/juweipku/CoCo.

### Summary
This paper introduces CoCo, a conjoint framework for deep graph clustering. Addressing limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in capturing global relationships and handling redundancy and noise in graph data, CoCo aims to learn node representations endowed with compactness and consistency. The method first leverages graph convolutional filters to extract node features from both local and global views. These representations are then encoded into low-rank compact embeddings using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to eliminate redundancy and noise. Finally, a consistency learning strategy is developed to facilitate knowledge transfer between the compact embeddings from the two perspectives, thereby enriching node semantics. Experimental results demonstrate that CoCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The paper clearly identifies existing GNN limitations in capturing global relationships and handling redundancy/noise, proposing targeted solutions. The proposed CoCo framework innovatively combines graph diffusion (for global view), disentangled graph convolutional filters (for feature extraction), GMM-based low-rank compactness learning, and cross-view consistency learning, with these components synergistically improving clustering performance.

### Weaknesses
The paper states that GMM aims to maximize p(Z|\lambda) and that prior probabilities and covariance matrices are fixed. A more detailed explanation is needed for this simplification, such as why these parameters are fixed and how this impacts the model's generality. The limitations of the existing methods lack support from newer literature. Related work does not correspond to the limitations of the existing works. Theorem 2 requires further explanation. The information loss or over-smoothing risk that low-pass filtering and low-rank approximation may bring during denoising may reduce the practical application of this paper.

### Questions
Theorem 2 seems to be insufficiently proven.

Is the setting of noise only beneficial to the author's method?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for deep graph clustering that aims to learn node representations which are both compact and consistent. The model addresses two key limitations in existing methods: the inability of standard GNNs to capture global node relationships and the sensitivity to noise and redundancy in graph data. The methodology first extracts node features from both local (original adjacency matrix) and global (graph diffusion matrix) views using disentangled graph convolutional filters. These features are then encoded into a low-rank subspace via a Gaussian mixture model to eliminate redundancy and noise, producing compact embeddings. Finally, a consistency learning strategy aligns the similarity distributions of nodes between the two views using a symmetric KL-divergence loss, enriching the semantics without needing negative samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that CoCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
- The model effectively integrates both local and global structural information to form comprehensive node representations
- The low-rank compactness learning effectively reduces noise and redundancy, leading to more robust embeddings.
- The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis that justifies the rationale behind the proposed technique.
- It demonstrates strong generalization capability by achieving superior performance across diverse tasks, including both node clustering and classification.
- The approach is computationally efficient and scalable to large graphs, owing to its linear complexity.

### Weaknesses
- The GMM-based low-rank learning adds model complexity and training steps.
- The sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters is relatively limited.

### Questions
- In Equation 1, what is the impact of different values of $k$ on model performance? Please provide further experimental explanation.
- The author's original intention to propose the use of graph convolutional filters is to disentangle the filters and the weight matrix. How to prove its effectiveness?
- In Section 2.2, why is GMM used for low-rank subspace training? Why is the original embedding representation $\mathbf{Z}$ added in Equation 5?
- Since the EM algorithm is independent of the model training, how does its initialization affect the model? What is the additional training cost required?

### Summary
This paper addresses the limitations of graph clustering, particularly their inability to capture global node relations and their susceptibility to redundancy and noise in learned representations. The authors propose a conjoint framework, CoCo, which learns robust representations from local and global views through graph convolutional filters, encodes them into low-rank compact embeddings to eliminate redundancy and noise, and further introduces a consistency learning strategy to transfer knowledge across views. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoCo consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
- The research topic is important and meaningful in the graph learning field, and appeals to a broad audience.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Its cutting-edge, rational technical solution addresses long-distance dependence, redundancy, and noise in feature representation, which are often overlooked in the current graph clustering field.
- The theoretical analysis further reinforces the soundness and validity of the proposed scheme.
- Extensive experiments and analyses across multiple downstream tasks and over ten baseline methods fully demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority, and effectively validate the study’s stated motivations.

### Weaknesses
- Neither the Introduction section nor the methods selected for comparative experiments have incorporated studies published in 2025.  
- The main research results lack statistical significance tests.

### Questions
- For the graph convolutional filter adopted in Eq. 1, how well would it perform if this filter were replaced with GCN?
- The authors proposed GMM-based compactness learning; what impact would using only PCA dimensionality reduction have?
- In Eq. 7, the authors only use sum averaging for the semantic representation of the two different branches. Would performance improve if attention weighting were used instead?
- For the node classification evaluation, clarification is needed on whether the authors applied a classification head to the representation and trained via a supervised loss, or trained with an unsupervised loss before supervised fine-tuning.
- The calculations of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are based on cosine similarity. Why was this similarity metric chosen instead of other methods? How would the results compare with those from other methods?

2.Why is EM-based subspace learning used?

3.Why compact learning can eliminate redundancy and mitigate the impact of noise requires further clarification.

4.When fusing local and global representations, equal weights are used. Why not adopt adaptive weights (e.g., learned via attention) to prioritize more informative views?
