## Abstract
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models faces two critical limitations: (i) reliance on verifiable rewards restricts applicability to domains with accessible ground truth answers; (ii) training demands long rollouts (e.g., 16K tokens for complex math problems). We propose \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{P}refix and \textbf{I}ntrinsic \textbf{R}eward (\textbf{RLPIR}), a verifier‑free reinforcement learning framework that learns from intrinsic rewards while reducing compute. RLPIR includes (1) a \textbf{prefix rollout} paradigm that avoids long rollouts by optimizing only the first $L$ tokens, and (2) an \textbf{intra‑group consistency reward} that eliminates reliance on verifiable rewards by measuring consistency among multiple sampled outputs. Across mathematical and general benchmarks, \textbf{RLPIR} matches RLVR's performance without ground truth, while substantially reducing training time by $6.96\times$. Moreover, \textbf{RLPIR} reduces reasoning sequence length by 45\%, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs.

### Summary
This paper proposes RLPIR (Reinforcement Learning with Prefix and Intrinsic Reward), a verifier-free reinforcement learning framework for large language models that eliminates dependence on ground-truth verifiers and substantially reduces rollout cost. RLPIR introduces two key ideas: a prefix rollout paradigm that optimizes only the first few hundred tokens (e.g., 512) of reasoning, and an intra-group consistency reward that measures semantic similarity among multiple sampled outputs as an intrinsic learning signal. The method achieves performance comparable to verifier-based RLVR (e.g., GRPO-16K) across mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks while offering a 6.96× training speed-up and a 45% reduction in reasoning length. Extensive ablations and analyses (prefix length, advantage shaping, data difficulty) confirm its effectiveness in design. While existing work has explored the similar idea in SFT training, this work can be a pioneering work in the RLVR field.

### Strengths
- **Well-motivated.** The paper presents a clear and empirically grounded motivation through two preliminary studies showing that short prefixes capture most of the useful learning signal and that high-consistency prefixes correlate with correctness. The motivation connects well to the later design of the RLPIR algorithm.
- **Efficiency.** RLPIR achieves a substantial 6.96× reduction in training time compared to RLVR while maintaining comparable accuracy. The prefix rollout design reduces long-horizon credit assignment and training instability by focusing on the most critical early decision tokens. This leads not only to faster training but also to shorter and more efficient reasoning trajectories at inference time.
- **Generalization.** The method demonstrates transferability across multiple model families (Llama, Qwen2.5, Qwen3) and task domains (general and math). This prefix rollout design avoids overfitting to specific solutions and promotes better cross-domain generalization. RLPIR also offers a promising path for applying RLVR to domains where verifiable signals are hard to access or unavailable.

### Weaknesses
- **Overlap with existing work.** The core idea of prefix-based optimization and its motivation are largely inherited from the prior work [1], **where similar findings on prefix consistency and prefix finetuning have already been established.** This paper mainly revalidates those insights and designs an RL-based training algorithm, in contrast to the original SFT formulation in the previous study. As a result, the conceptual originality is somewhat reduced, and the contribution lies more in integration and empirical verification rather than in introducing a fundamentally new algorithmic innovation.
- **Incomplete and unstable results.** The main results in Table 3 **omit** RLVR baselines for the Llama3.1 and Qwen2.5 models, making it difficult to consistently assess the relative gains. Moreover, since these models often produce outputs shorter than Qwen3 (thinking), additional evidence is needed to support the claimed efficiency benefits of applying 512 token prefix rollouts to them. Most analyses (Sections 7.3, 8.1–8.3) rely on the Qwen3-8B that is a **“thinking”** model, which tends to generate extremely long reasoning output; thus, the reported improvements may not generalize to non-reasoning models such as Qwen2.5-Instruct or even Qwen3-Base.
- **Hyperparameter dependence.** The method’s performance is sensitive to the choice of prefix length, as shown in Section 8.1, and different models may require distinct optimal prefix settings (more results are needed here). This suggests that prefix length functions as a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned, therefore limiting the practical usability of RLPIR across diverse settings. Developing an adaptive or self-scheduled prefix selection mechanism could help mitigate this limitation and enhance the framework’s robustness and applicability.

### Questions
1. How was the prefix length of 512 tokens determined for models other than Qwen3-8B? Could the authors provide statistics showing what percentage of responses are longer or shorter than this threshold for each model? This would help assess whether the chosen prefix length covers most reasoning cases.
2. Can RLPIR surpass vanilla RLVR on regular models that typically generate shorter responses (e.g., Qwen2.5 series)? It would be helpful to understand whether the observed gains mainly benefit “thinking” models with long reasoning outputs.

### Summary
The paper proposes a verifier-free reinforcement learning framework for large language models (LLMs). It addresses key drawbacks of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which relies on ground-truth answers and long rollouts. RLPIR introduces two main innovations: (1) a prefix rollout strategy that optimizes only the first 512 tokens of reasoning—reducing computation time by about 6.96×—and (2) an intra-group consistency reward that measures semantic similarity among multiple generated outputs, eliminating the need for external verifiers. Experiments across mathematical and general benchmarks show that RLPIR achieves performance comparable to RLVR while lowering computational cost and shortening reasoning sequences by 45%, improving inference efficiency. The method also generalizes better across domains without explicit verifiable rewards, marking a step toward scalable, unsupervised reinforcement learning for reasoning-focused LLMs

### Strengths
(1) Novel insight into reasoning optimization: To me, the biggest takeaway is that the paper demonstrates that full reasoning trajectories are not necessary for effective reinforcement learning. Training on a short prefix (e.g., 512 tokens) retains most of the useful learning signal — a valuable finding that challenges conventional long-rollout assumptions in GRPO-style training.

(2) Clear efficiency gains: RLPIR achieves a 6.96× reduction in training time and a 45% shorter inference sequence, which represents a major advance in the efficiency of reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

(3) Strong empirical validation: Through systematic experiments and ablations, the paper shows that prefix-based optimization achieves comparable accuracy to full-length RLVR baselines, while drastically reducing training cost and reasoning length.

### Weaknesses
(1) The claimed training and inference efficiency improvements (6.96× faster, 45% shorter reasoning) are somewhat unclear/unfair, since reasoning length is a tunable factor (you can even forcefully truncate). A more controlled baseline, such as RLPIR-512 vs RLVR-512 with enforced 512-token rollouts, and RLPIR-16k vs RLVR-16k, would make the comparison fairer and more convincing.

(2) My main concern is incremental novelty. The core equation is (7), and all the remaining formulations are the same as previous ones.
and my understanding of this method is closer to the majority voting-style intrinsic reward like TTRL https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16084. 

(3) It will be better if you show the training trend of all the key indicators like the validation accuracy besides the similarity rewards, also comparing these trends with grpo in the the same figure will further strengthen your arguments, especially when Figure 4 looks quite noisy with large variance.

(4) It will be good if you can also compare with other sota verifier-free rl methods which also claim advantage over rlvr.

### Questions
(1) In RLPIR, how do you make sure the prefix rollout length is limited to 512 length? by meta-prompting or just hard truncation?

(2) Could you give any pointers/reference (if any) that the math datasets you used would make qwen3 with grpo generate 16k-long reasoning length?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method named RLPIR to eliminate the problems in RLVR: 1. dependence on verifiers 2. long CoT in training 3. in-efficient inference. They only train on the prefix of model rollouts (like 512 tokens), using group semantic similarity as intrinsic reward. Also use asymmetric advantages to prevent collapse. The results show comparable results as RLVR (better on general reasoning domains) with shorter CoT.

### Strengths
1. Only training on prefix is clever and makes sense. The idea is easy to understand and the results look solid, try different models, see comparable performance on MATH tasks and better performance on general domains, with shorter CoT.
2. The idea of asymmetric advantage is clever and critical(as shown in ablation study)

### Weaknesses
1. only comparing RLVR and RLPIR on Qwen models, not on Llama models (only RLPIR).
2. I like prefix method, but it's kind of tricky, because different models and domains have different length of important prefix. When training RLVR on different domains together, it's ad-hoc to tune the prefix length, limit the generalization of the method.
3. Penalize the diverse outputs may be helpful for math tasks, as shown in the recent works that RLVR always decrease the output entropy[1,3], and accelerate this process may make model converge faster[2]. RLPIR looks also accelerate this process. But it's not definitely helpful for long-term training. Especially it's not applicable for open-ended problems or long-form generation tasks, also limit its influence. (paper only discuss on math training set)
4. Maybe you could compare the pass@k performance between RLVR/RLPIR/original model, I think RLPIR may increase slower as k increases since it encourages more consistent output.
5. Writing needs to be more formalized. Like in Tab. 1, the result 13.3 should not be bold, which always refer to the best result in the table. And the 'impossible triangle' sounds little weird. I think they are just three relatively independent difficulty in RLVR, not dependent triangles.

### Summary
This paper presents two tricks for RL for LLM reasoning, aiming to address some critical issues of the RL training. One issue is the dependence on the reward verifier for RLVR. The second issue is the high training cost, due to the long generated sequences in the RL training. The third one is the inference inefficiency. In order to solve these issues, the authors proposed the following tricks.

1. They train RL algorithms only on the prefix rollouts: they generate L tokens (<< the usual maximal number of response tokens) for each sequence and train RL algorithms on them.

2. Because we cannot apply a verifiable reward for the response prefix (the model has not produced the final answer), they proposed the intro-group consistency reward by computing the sentence embedding of each prefix and computing the cosine similarity between each prefix's embedding and the average embedding. To avoid reward hacking, they clip the positive advantage.

They did experiments on the Qwen series and found that the RLPIR has similar performance as vanilla RLVR while reducing the computational costs significantly, and the trained model tends to output shorter sequences, which improves inference efficiency.

### Strengths
1. They apply proposed prefix rollouts, a novel RL technique that, in principle, can reduce the computational costs in the training time. The initial experiments about the DPO on the prefix, as well as the experiments of forced-prefix continuation, clearly show the motivation for this.

2. Section 7.2 shows a significant reduction in the wall-clock training time on Qwen3-8B for 1000 optimization steps.

### Weaknesses
1. The intra-group consistency reward relies on an external sentence embedding model. Is the result you get robust against the choice of this sentence embedding model? Is it possible to use the generating model itself to form a sentence embedding to compute the reward (so that the entire process does not rely on external information, and this becomes a pure unsupervised algorithm).

2. Lack of fair comparison. It lacks the performance of vanilla RLVR for the experiments on Llama and Qwen2.5 series, so that it remains unclear whether their claim is consistent across different base models. For the experiments in sections 7.2 and 7.3, the authors use Qwen3-8B, and as far as I know, this is actually an instruct model that tends to output very long sequences. I am not sure whether using this as a baseline is a fair comparison. I think the author should also report the computational speedup compared with the Qwen3-8b-base models. 

3. The asymmetric advantage: The author uses a heuristic advantage clipping method to clip all the positive advantages. The '0' in the equation A_g = min(0, \tilde A_g) should, in fact, be a hyperparameter that we should tune to balance the trade-off between avoiding reward hacking and keeping the original advantage. Did the author try other clipping hyperparameters? Is there a special reason that you use this heuristic clipping method?
