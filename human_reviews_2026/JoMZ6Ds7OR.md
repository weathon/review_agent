- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 2, 6

## Abstract
We propose using frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for macro placement in chip floorplanning, a complex optimization task that has recently shown promising advancements through machine learning methods. For human designers, macro placement is an inherently visual process that relies on spatial reasoning to arrange components on the chip canvas. Because VLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities over visual inputs, we hypothesize that these models can effectively complement existing learning-based approaches. We introduce VeoPlace (Visual Evolutionary Optimization Placement), a novel framework that uses a VLM to guide the actions of a base policy by constraining them to subregions of the chip canvas. The VLM proposals are iteratively optimized through an evolutionary search strategy with respect to resulting placement quality. On open-source benchmarks, VeoPlace establishes a new state-of-the-art for learning-based methods, outperforming the strongest prior approach across all evaluated circuits by reducing wirelength by an average of 10.9% with peak improvements of over 20%. Our approach opens new possibilities for electronic design automation tools that leverage foundation models to solve complex physical design problems.

### Summary
This paper proposes a vision-language model (VLM)-guided placer for macro placement. It integrates a VLM into an existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based placer. The VLM generates bounding boxes for macros, which serve as placement guidance to the RL agent, thereby enhancing overall placement quality.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well structured and readable overall.
2.	The paper explores a novel integration of large vision-language models (VLMs) into macro placement, an underexplored direction in physical design automation.

### Weaknesses
1.	Several technical descriptions are inaccurate. For example, the statement: “Determining the optimal placement is a complex multi-objective problem, in which performance, power, and area (PPA) must be optimized while respecting constraints such as routing congestion” is inaccurate. Routing congestion is not a strict constraint in placement. Instead, it is a soft objective or cost function term that placer tries to minimize, but not a rule that must be strictly satisfied.
2.	The method is compared only with ChiPFormer, an RL-based placer. For a fair and comprehensive evaluation, strong analytical placers such as DREAMPlace [1] and RePlAce [2] should also be included.
3.	The experiments rely on old academic benchmarks. These do not reflect the complexity of modern designs. Evaluation on open-source real-world testcases should be included.
4.	The paper does not quantify how often or how effectively VLM guidance is used versus fallback RL policies.

### Questions
1.	The current experiments use simplified academic benchmarks released 20 years ago. Please evaluate your proposed method on open-source real-world designs from the OpenROAD (https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD) or MacroPlacement (https://github.com/TILOS-AI-Institute/MacroPlacement) repositories. For example, ariane, bp_quad and swer_wrapper on Nangate45 technology node. 
2.	It would be better to provide post-route PPA results (e.g., TNS, WNS, power) for these testcases instead of just post-placement wirelength.
3.	In Algorithm 1 (line 12), when the VLM’s suggestion is invalid, the low-level policy makes the placement decision. Please analyze how many macros placements are decided by the VLM versus the fallback policy.  
4.	What determines the placement order of macros? Is it based on size, connectivity, or heuristic sequencing? Why did you choose this ordering?
5.	The ISPD2005 benchmarks contain IOs, macros and standard cells. How do you separate these components, and are fixed IOs considered during VLM encoding?
6.	During macro placement, how do you model the connectivity with unplaced standard cells?
7.	Do your final placement results guarantee no overlap between macros and standard cells? How is legalization performed?
8.	The method is compared only with ChiPFormer, an RL-based placer. For a fair and comprehensive evaluation, strong analytical placers such as DREAMPlace and RePlAce should also be included.

### Summary
This paper introduces VeoPlace (Visual Evolutionary Optimization Placement), a novel framework that uses a VLM to guide the actions of a base policy by constraining them to subregions of the chip canvas. The VLM proposals are iteratively optimized through an evolutionary search strategy with respect to resulting placement quality.

### Strengths
1: It is an interesting research direction to leverage visual LLM into floor based problem.

2. The proposed method combines the advantage of ChipFormer and VLM in the floor based problem.

3: The experimental results illustrate that the method is promising.

### Weaknesses
1: The effectiveness of VLM in guiding floor planning should be further discussed.

2: More competitors should be included in the experimental study

3: The scalability of the proposed method should be handled.

### Questions
1, The scalability of the methods should be discussed. With the increase of the macros, VLM face difficulty in capture the key relationship between region and modules.

2, The design principle is that VLM can provide the global view of the layout. It might due to the limitation of the chipformer, a RL based method, which has the view on the partial placed macros. It will be more convincing to incorporate the finding of VLM into other analytical methods, which have the global view of the layout.

3. Some RL methods learn how to adjust the global layout. It is better to include these methods in the comparison.

4. Macro color represent the relationships among macro, which captured by the VLM. Is it possible to directly learn the region suggest using the LLM (instead of VLM) on macro cluster. 

4.1 Such an alternative at least can avoid the issue to align the macro and rectangle in the image. 

4.2 The graph cluster is difficult on densely connected graph. Actually, the graph cluster can be dramatically changed on such a case.

4.2 The relationship between macros and suggested regions can be learned from the text form of the cluster, or the original form without cluster.

### Summary
This paper introduces VeoPlace, a framework that leverages vision-language models to guide macro placement in chip floorplanning, an essential and complex step in integrated circuit design. The key innovation is using a high-level VLM to provide spatial reasoning and suggest promising placement regions. VeoPlace uses an evolutionary search strategy, where placements are iteratively refined by the VLM based on past results. Besides, here proposes a top stratified context selection method, which selects geometrically similar, high-quality placements as examples for the VLM, outperforming other strategies like random or diverse selection. Experiments on open-source benchmarks show that VeoPlace reduces wirelength by an average of 10.9% compared to the strongest prior learning-based method.

### Strengths
- This work show that vision-language models can directly improve the macro placement without any domain-specific fine-tuning. 
- Achieves 10.9% average wire-length reduction and >20% peak improvement over the strongest previous learning-based method across 12 public benchmarks ranging from 200 to 2M standard cells.
- Delivers all improvements as test time scaling, no re-training or gradient updates of either VLM or low-level policy- making it cheap, fast and industry-friendly.

### Weaknesses
- High VLM inference cost: since each guided iteration issues one call to Gemini-2.0/2.5; Median latency is 40-200s per batch of 8 episodes. Here a full 4000-rollout run needs 250 calls, maybe 2.5 wall-clock hours on one A100 just for VLM queries, dwarfing the milliseconds needed by the 3 M-parameter ChiPFormer.
- Constraint handling is not enough: since only wirelength is optimised, while routing congestion, timing, power-grid integrity are not modeled. 
- Limited generalisation study: all 12 test circuits are from the same two academic benchmarks (ISPD05/ICCAD04), and its share similar netlist statistics. There is no zero-shot transfer to recent industrial blocks (e.g. large macros + macro-halo, mixed row-alignment, power-domain or clock constraints)

### Questions
- Macro placement is not a simple "jogsaw-puzzle" of rectangular blocks, it is the fruit of years of EDA expertise that must simultaneously routing wirelength, timing, power and clock architecture. Therefore, current VLMs possess almost none of this domain-specific knowledge, so are there any adavantage to use VLM for macro placement?
- Wirelength is only 5-10% of final timing & power cost. While the VLM is rewarded with a proxy (e.g., HPWL), how do this work align its proposals with true sign-off metrics (WNS, TNS, DRV count) without running a full physical synthesis flow inside the loop?
- Have you tested VeoPlace on any recent industrial blocks (e.g., modern CPU/GPU)? What happens to the 10% gain in that setting?

### Summary
This paper presents VeoPlace, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models to guide macro placement in chip floorplanning through evolutionary optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results and demonstrating the potential of foundation models for physical design automation.

### Strengths
- The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide placement suggestions is highly novel. With the rapid advancement of VLM technology, it is reasonable to expect that their general knowledge and reasoning capabilities could be leveraged to assist in physical design tasks.
- The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, including analyses with multiple configurations and reporting the corresponding variances.

### Weaknesses
- Based on prior experience, general-purpose VLMs tend to perform well on broad, everyday visual tasks such as answering questions about images, but placement is a highly specialized and complex optimization problem that requires a deep understanding of domain-specific constraints and objectives.
- Some results show relatively low correlation between the grouped-HPWL and the global HPWL, which raises concerns about the accuracy of this surrogate metric.

### Questions
Could the authors elaborate further on why a VLM is capable of providing meaningful placement suggestions? A human without any background in physical design would generally be unable to make such spatial decisions, so a detailed justification of the model’s reasoning ability in this context would be helpful.
