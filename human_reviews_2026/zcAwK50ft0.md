- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 2, 8, 4, 6

## Abstract
This paper presents a unified framework for simulating and visualizing dynamic fracture phenomena in extreme mechanical collisions using multi-view image inputs. While existing methods primarily address elastic deformations at contact surfaces, they fail to capture the complex physics of extreme collisions, often producing non-physical artifacts and material adhesion at fracture interfaces. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) an enhanced Collision Material Point Method (Collision-MPM) with momentum-conserving interface forces derived from normalized mass distributions, which effectively eliminates unphysical adhesion in fractured solids; and (2) a fracture-aware 3D Gaussian continuum representation that enables physically plausible rendering without post-processing. The framework operates through three main stages: First, performing implicit reconstruction of collision objects from multi-view images while sampling both surface and internal particles and simultaneously learning surface particle Gaussian properties via splatting; Second, high-fidelity collision resolution using our improved Collision-MPM formulation; Third, dynamic fracture tracking with Gaussian attribute optimization for fracture surfaces rendering. Through comprehensive testing, our framework demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods in handling diverse scenarios, including homogeneous materials, heterogeneous composites, and complex multi-body collisions. The results confirm superior physical accuracy, while maintaining computational efficiency for rendering.

### Summary
The authors propose an extension to the PhysGaussian framework to handle fractures. In their simulation, they use separate velocity fields for different objects and apply collision forces to the nodes that are commonly affected. This contact model can eliminate the sticky artifacts when two objects collide. The NACC plasticity model is employed to simulate fracture behavior. However, this improvement of MPM simulation is novel. The contact model seems identical to the one in [1]. For rendering, the hardening factor is used to track crack propagation and to split Gaussian kernels accordingly. This handling is kind of novel and clever.

### Strengths
- The handling of fractures in GS-based MPM simulation is indeed a neat solution.

### Weaknesses
- The contact model is claimed to be one of contributions. However, the model seems identical to the one in [1]. A clarification on difference and novelty is needed.

- The experiment is insufficient. Only 3 examples are provided for comparison and the user study. The conclusion is not significant enough.

- The simulation scenes are overly idealized. The presented examples do not fully demonstrate the strength of Gaussian splatting in reconstructing real-world data. A traditional MPM simulation and rendering pipeline should be able to handle better.

- A limitation is that the framework seems quite bound to NACC or similar plasticity model that has hardening mechanism. However, MPM supports many commonly used plasticity models.

- Some unprofessional typos: 
  - Line 256: Figure 7?
  - Line 344: The deformation gradient is not additive.
  - Line 369: "and" is in math mode
  - Line 425: zhang2018unreasonable?

### Questions
- How image metrics are computed? I assume there is no ground truth for simulated results. If only the reconstruction error is compared, it is not fair. I would expect that all method can start from the same initial Gaussian Splatting representation? Are there any modifications to GS reconstruction to increase the image metrics?

- How is $\mu$ in Eq.13 set? I would expect that a too small value can cause penetration and a too large value can cause simulation explosion?

- How to make sure the total energy (kinematics energy + elasticity energy + gravity potential) does not increase to cause instability.  Unit tests on energy should be included.

- The plant in Fig. 5 should not be plastic. How different materials are assigned?

### Summary
The paper proposes Fracture-GS, a unified system that integrates physics-based dynamic fracture simulation with 3D Gaussian splatting rendering to realistically model high-energy collisions and material breakage. Traditional methods either simulate deformation without handling fracture or rely on post-processing for visualization, often producing non-physical adhesion artifacts and discontinuous fracture surfaces. Fracture-GS addresses these limitations through two core components: an enhanced Collision Material Point Method (Collision-MPM) and a Fracture Particle Gaussian Optimization (FPGO) strategy. The Collision-MPM introduces momentum-conserving interface forces based on normalized mass distributions, effectively preventing unrealistic adhesion in multi-body collisions. Meanwhile, FPGO leverages hardening-aware fracture tracking and minimal-volume enclosing ellipsoid (MVEE) optimization to regenerate Gaussian particle attributes dynamically, ensuring smooth, physically consistent fracture rendering.

The framework operates from multi-view image reconstruction to high-fidelity simulation and real-time visualization, handling both homogeneous and heterogeneous materials under extreme impact. Experiments on scenes such as colliding teapots, tables, and plants show that Fracture-GS delivers significantly higher physical realism and visual quality than prior Gaussian-based approaches like PhysGaussian and GIC. Quantitative metrics (PSNR, LPIPS, FID) and human evaluation confirm its superior fidelity, while ablation studies demonstrate the critical roles of both the Collision-MPM and FPGO modules. Overall, Fracture-GS offers a physically accurate, visually coherent, and computationally efficient solution for simulating and rendering complex fracture dynamics directly from image-based inputs.

### Strengths
The main strengths of Fracture-GS lie in its innovative integration of physics-based simulation and Gaussian rendering. The framework unifies dynamic fracture simulation with photorealistic visualization, allowing collisions and material breakage to be simulated and rendered directly from multi-view inputs without post-processing. Its enhanced Collision-MPM formulation introduces momentum-conserving interface forces that eliminate the common adhesion artifacts seen in standard MPM methods, resulting in more realistic object separation and fracture behavior. This physically grounded improvement enables the system to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous materials under extreme impact conditions with high accuracy.

A second major strength is the Fracture Particle Gaussian Optimization (FPGO) module, which uses hardening-aware fracture tracking and ellipsoid-based Gaussian reconstruction to maintain visual smoothness across newly formed fracture surfaces. This innovation ensures physical plausibility and visual coherence even in complex fragmentation scenes. Combined with strong empirical validation—demonstrating clear advantages over prior approaches like PhysGaussian and GIC in both quantitative metrics and human perception tests—Fracture-GS establishes a new standard for integrating continuum mechanics with 3D Gaussian splatting. Its blend of physical realism, visual fidelity, and computational efficiency makes it a significant contribution to the field of physics-integrated neural rendering.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of Fracture-GS stem from its computational cost and scalability limits. The enhanced Collision-MPM and fracture-aware Gaussian optimization (FPGO) introduce additional per-frame overhead for fracture tracking and Gaussian reconstruction, making the system too slow for real-time or large-scale simulations. While the method achieves high-quality results, it is currently best suited for offline rendering and controlled experimental setups.

Another limitation is the framework’s parameter sensitivity and narrow validation scope. It relies on manually tuned material parameters such as elasticity and hardening factors, which may limit generalization to new materials or real-world data. The experiments focus mainly on clean, synthetic collisions, without testing robustness under noisy or incomplete multi-view inputs. Overall, the method is conceptually strong but computationally heavy and parameter-dependent, leaving room for improvement in automation, generalization, and efficiency.

### Questions
The followings are the questions:
1. How does Fracture-GS scale with respect to the number of particles and fracture events? Could GPU parallelization or adaptive time-stepping make the system closer to real-time performance?
2. The method relies on several material-dependent parameters (e.g., Young’s modulus, hardening factor, cohesion). How sensitive is the simulation to these values, and could a learning-based or automatic parameter estimation approach reduce manual tuning?
3. Have you evaluated the framework using real captured multi-view data with noise or incomplete coverage? How robust is the reconstruction and simulation pipeline in such cases?
4. Can the same physics-integrated Gaussian framework be extended to simulate fluids, soft bodies, or granular materials under fracture or mixing conditions?
5. When handling high-energy impacts or very thin fracture surfaces, how does the momentum-conserving collision formulation maintain numerical stability? Are there cases where it fails or diverges?

### Summary
The paper proposes Fracture‑GS, a pipeline that (i) reconstructs objects from multi‑view images and assigns surface Gaussians, (ii) runs an enhanced Collision‑MPM intended to avoid non‑physical adhesion in impacts, and (iii) performs fracture‑aware Gaussian optimization (FPGO) that clones/reshapes Gaussians near newly exposed fracture surfaces via a minimal‑volume enclosing ellipsoid heuristic. The system is demonstrated on three scenarios (Ficus, Teapot, Table) with qualitative renderings and a small quantitative table.

### Strengths
+ The paper tackles a real pain point: adhesion artifacts in grid‑based MPM around contacts. The visual before/after in Fig. 6 makes the problem clear.

+ The pipeline is pragmatic and easy to follow, with implementation details and timings.

### Weaknesses
- Theoretical issues: Section 4.2.1 writes the plasticity split as F = F_E + F_P and uses a non‑standard Cauchy‑stress expression. The correct finite strain plasticity should be F = F_E @ F_P; addition will lead to wrong stresses. It’s unclear what the code actually uses. This is a correctness issue, not just notation.

- The contact model is a heuristic, frictionless, and under‑explained. Normals come from differences of normalized mass‑weighted kernel gradients, then a momentum‑conserving node force is applied and projected only along the normal with a constant \mu. There is no friction cone, no restitution, and no complementarity constraints. The paper asserts conservation but shows no momentum/energy plots or penetration statistics.

- I am also confused about the motivation for using Gaussian points as the representation. Most of the physics here is standard MLS‑MPM on particles. Surface particles just carry isotropic Gaussians for rendering, and FPGO computes shapes by fitting an ellipsoid to the overlap of two spheres before duplicating the particle. That’s a rendering heuristic, not physics. The paper never quantifies what Gaussians buy you over simply rendering particles as points/splats or extracting a mesh from the simulation. If I treat Gaussians as points and run a vanilla MPM, do I lose anything besides SH‑based view‑dependent color?

- Appendix A.3 gives a closed‑form approximation to the MVEE of a sphere–sphere intersection and uses it to set the new Gaussian’s mean/covariance. There is no actual optimization loop, proof of minimality, or ablation against simpler choices (e.g., just reuse the parent particle, or refit an anisotropic Gaussian from neighbors). Yet this step is claimed to drive the gains in Fig. 5.

- Comparisons are only against PhysGaussian and GIC, not against fracture‑capable MPM/contact baselines; metrics are image‑space (PSNR/LPIPS/FID) plus a tiny user study (N = 10). There’s no physics validation: no momentum/energy traces, no penetration depths, no fragment size distributions, no restitution. If the key claim is momentum‑conserving collision forces that remove adhesion, I need physics diagnostics.

- Sensitivity to particle sampling is unaddressed. Change the interior density, or its near‑boundary distribution, and those nodewise estimates can change materially. There's no ablation for particle‑per‑cell, interior/surface ratios, or grid resolution.

- The number of scenes shown across the paper is extremely limited. The generalization ability of the proposed method is a large concern.

### Questions
- What is the benefit of Gaussians over point particles? You already restrict to isotropic Gaussians on the surface, and FPGO’s shape comes from sphere overlaps. That suggests a point‑splat baseline could be nearly identical but simpler. Please quantify rendering quality, temporal stability, and runtime against:
(i) MPM + point sprites / disk splats;
(ii) MPM + sphere splats with the same nearest‑only occlusion rule;
(iii) MPM + mesh (e.g., marching cubes) + rasterization.

- What’s different from treating Gaussians as points and running standard MPM? If the Collision‑MPM and fracture rule run on the same particle set regardless of the renderer, then the scientific contribution is not physics‑integrated Gaussians but a contact heuristic and a rendering trick. Spell out where Gaussians influence the physics (if at all) and justify the coupling.

### Summary
This paper generalizes Gaussian splatting to handle deformation and fracture simulation. This is done by integrating Gaussian platting with deformation and fracture simulation handled by the material point method. The proposed approach builds on a number of recent papers at the intersection of these topics, namely "Physics-integrated 3D gaussians for generative dynamics" by Xie et al. (2024) and "Gaussian-informed continuum for physical property identification and simulation" by Cai et al. (2024). The key difference is that this paper adds support for simulating fractures. The equations for doing so are spelled out in detail, and the authors benchmark their results on a number of reasonable looking examples. In particular, the authors include not only quantitative benchmarks, but also a human evaluation study to assess simulation fidelity.

As a disclaimer, I largely work on topics outside of this area, but did write a few papers earlier in my career on related topics. Therefore, my views on state-of-the-art methods and benchmarking are likely not to be up to date, so I will concentrate more on factors such as soundness and readability as opposed to performance comparisons, which I hope other reviewers will be more able to contribute to.

### Strengths
I see the following key strengths:
* **Important topic.** Being able to simulate physics in a Gaussian splatting like framework is a useful technical capability to build, because over time this might allow us to build interpretable world models for domains like robotics.
* **Approach is interpretable and makes sense.** Combining a material description built in the framework of Gaussian splatting - where rather than visual parameters like opacity, the authors propose a larger set of parameters including mass, volume, elasticity parameters such as Young's modulus and Poisson ratio, and others to do with deformation and fracture simulation. This is a reasonably intuitive way to bring together these methods. While I have not read the prior papers on non-fracture physics simulation via Gaussian splatting, I believe the new part here are the parameters needed to support fractures, and pinning this down is a reasonable contribution.
* **Key equations are all stated in the paper, with only details deferred to appendix.** The equations used to simulate how the Gaussians evolve over time are spelled out in some detail. I expect a reader familiar with this literature will not have trouble figuring out precisely what the authors are doing purely from the paper, that is without having to do detailed digging in the appendix or code.
* **Experiments include both quantitative comparisons and human evaluation.** Following my original disclaimer, due to not working in related areas for some time, I am less equipped to assess whether or not the results are state-of-the-art, and if so how strong is the degree of improvement compared to prior papers. However, the problems tested, such as simulation of a potted plant breaking, seem reasonable, as does the the larger evaluation structure, given the authors include both quantitative comparisons and human evaluations.

### Weaknesses
I am concerned about the following:
* **Sloppy writing with typos, unresolved references, and other evidence of work done in a rush.** For example, many of the citations such as Stomakhin et al. (2013) should be in parentheses, meaning (Stomakhin et al., 2013). Similar for Wolper et al. (2019). Please fix these. For another example, Section 2.3 has a section titled "Physics Simulation based on Gaussian". To avoid grammar mistakes that distract the reader, "Gaussian" should be changed to most likely "Gaussians" or something otherwise correct sounding. In the end, there is also a text "zhang2018unreasonable" where the authors forgot to add a citation command. This paper was clearly written up in a big rush, and for this reason alone I am open to the idea of rejecting the work to give the authors more time to polish the results before publication and presentation at a conference. This is the main reason I mark the work borderline: the contribution seems good, but it is very important for the review process incentivizes quality, and not rushed submissions.
* **Prior work section interrupts the paper's flow.** I would merge Section 2 with Section 3, moving the two subsections inside the corresponding parts of Section 3. The problem right now is that it is difficult to understand what the prior work is doing before the equations are introduced. For instance, on my first read, I was unable to properly understand the differences between this paper and prior papers also working with the material point method, due to not being immediately familiar with it. This became more clear once I read that section and realized that this method's broad structure is very similar to contact dynamics simulation methods I have worked extensively with in the past. At this point, I had to go back and re-read the prior work section. A modified structure such as the one I propose above would make it possible to avoid backtracking and read the paper all in one go, even if the reader is familiar with neighboring work rather than the precise approach used.
* **Diversity of experiments.** The authors' method is only tested on two models - a potted plant, and a desk. While the experiments themselves look reasonable, this seems much less in terms of comprehensiveness compared to what I am used to seeing in computer graphics papers. I hypothesize the relatively-small number of examples is related to the paper's writing issues mentioned earlier: the authors may have wanted to test more, but ran out of time before getting everything implemented. I suspect a re-submitted version would contain results closer to the typical level of comprehensiveness in this area.

### Questions
My main question is not to the authors, but rather to other reviewers in the discussion phase, who are hopefully more familiar with state-of-the-art in this space. The question is: are the authors' results SOTA compared to what is done today? If not, how far are they? In asking this, I encourage the AC to _not_ interpret this question as a demand for uniformly-SOTA results: the paper may well still be publication-worthy even if there are limitations - instead, I would simply like to know where this paper stands compared to other papers published very recently that I am less familiar with because they are too recent.
