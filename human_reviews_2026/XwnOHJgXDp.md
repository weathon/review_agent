## Abstract
Organizational success depends less on individual brilliance than on how teams are structured, coordinated, and adapted. Yet organizational design remains a grand challenge in computational science, and machine learning lacks tools to address it. We introduce the Organizational Design Problem (ODP): learning a management policy that configures team composition, communication, and autonomy to achieve multi-objective goals under structural constraints.

A main obstacle to developing machine learning for the ODP is the lack of suitable Organizational Simulation Environments (OSEs) in which such policies can be learned and evaluated. While organizational design is a general task as organizations are a universal feature of social and economic life, each organization is unique in its purpose, internal constraints, and external surroundings. Acknowledging this specificity, we propose an OSE blueprint: it defines the core components shared by all organizations while allowing adaptation to diverse contexts. In this framework, fixed LLM agents simulate realistic human roles and communicate via natural language within a mechanistic, temporally grounded simulation.

Applying this blueprint, we present the Clinical Trial OSE, which captures the high-stakes, multi-stakeholder process of drug development. Using this environment to benchmark pre-trained LLMs, we show that they can guide organizations to successfully complete trial programs. Although current models remain less efficient than humans, our study opens the path toward specialized models that could one day outperform humans in systematically solving the Organizational Design Problem.

### Summary
This paper introduces the Organizational Design Problem (ODPs) and attempts to learn a management policy that configures the team composition, communication, and autonomy to achieve multi-objective goals under structural constraints. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of Organizational Simulation Environments (OSEs), which couple domain-specific mechanistic models with LLM agents that communicate in natural language within a discrete-time simulation. The authors work with experts to create a Clinical Trial OSE that models up to 25 different actors and 8 drugs across several scenarios and benchmark baseline management policies. The results present interesting takeaways for future work in solving ODPs.

### Strengths
+ The formulation of the Clinical Trial OSE is interesting and well-formulated. This OSE is more complex than typical simulation environments due to the multiple actors and variables.
+ The evaluation is interesting and includes a comparison to a human management policy. The results show that there is still work to be done in addressing complex ODP problems with AI techniques.

### Weaknesses
- There is no validation to ensure that a real-world system (and all its components) will transition in the way the LLM specifies. 
- It is unclear how repeatable such a simulation will be. If a simulation is run with the same start state, same management policy, and same LLM, will the output be the same?

### Questions
- Can you provide evidence that the proposed Clinical Trial OSE behaves similarly to the real-world Clinical Trial with humans?
- Can you provide information regarding the repeatability of the simulation?
- Can you tell me which ODP environments such a framework is well-suited for and which it is not?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the formulation of the Organizational Design Problem and the introduction of a corresponding testbed, Organizational Simulation Environments (OSEs). These environments are governed by a mechanistic, discrete, domain-specific logic (e.g., elapsed time). The authors present a complex case study modeling a Clinical Trial and its associated organizational challenges.

### Strengths
- Addresses a crucial and challenging optimization problem within management and organizational science.
- Introduces a complex, multi-faceted case study (the Clinical Trial OSE) to benchmark organizational policies.
- Provides a comparative analysis of several pre-trained language models (LLMs) in this complex coordination task.

### Weaknesses
1. Mismatched Use Case for Organizational Design: The paper frames the challenges of clinical trials as resulting primarily from management and organizational design, yet it fails to substantiate this premise with supporting literature. This focus is questionable, as it ignores established research (e.g., Sun et al., "Why 90% of clinical drug development fails and how to improve it?")
2. Mismatch Between General Problem and Specific Implementation: There is a disconnect between the ambitious, general definition of the Organizational Design Problem (ODP) and its sole, highly specific implementation (a clinical trial). The paper fails to provide a clear path for adapting the framework to other organizational types, even simpler ones, thus leaving the claims of generalizability unsubstantiated.
3. Absence of Baseline: The task is defined as "learning a management policy," yet the paper demonstrates no learning or optimization process. The experiments are limited to evaluating pre-trained LLMs in a zero-shot, prompted setting. A crucial baseline attempting actual policy optimization (e.g., via RL) is missing.
4. Questionable Benchmark Complexity: The fact that pre-trained models achieve 100% success without any fine-tuning strongly undermines the paper's claims about the benchmark's complexity and difficulty.
5. Unanswered Questions: The introduction poses questions (e.g., "How should teams be structured?", "What communication policies minimize costly delays?"). However, the paper provides no answers or actionable insights toward solving them with OSE.
6. Unverified LLM Reliability: The simulation's success critically depends on the LLMs' ability to reliably simulate actors and use tools. The paper provides no information or analysis verifying this, ignoring known LLM limitations in consistency and tool-use fidelity.

### Questions
- The paper states real organizations have heterogeneous individuals (diverse personalities, skills, and experience). Why were these variations in agent attributes not implemented in the simulation? 
- What specific, actionable conclusions, if any, can be drawn from this single use-case simulation for the organizational design of real-world institutions?
- The results show variance in performance. What factor appears to be the primary driver of organizational success in the simulation: the level of autonomy, the defined communication policy, or the individual agents' competence in task execution?

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel research direction for organizational design based on reinforcement learning. They aim to develop a management policy that governs consolidation and communication among multiple actors, and shows enhanced robustness to unpredictable events and varied organizational contexts. The authors’ main contributions are: (1) modeling the organizational design problem as a POMDP; (2) proposing a blueprint for developing environments to study this problem; and (3) providing an instantiation of a clinical trial scenario while also evaluating different LLM-based management policy baselines on this scenario using multiple metrics.

### Strengths
* The paper integrates reinforcement learning into organizational design, offering a novel alternative to traditional analytical methods. I believe this approach to be quite novel, with the potential to assist humans in making faster and more accurate decisions across diverse organizational scenarios.
* The authors identify and motivate the research problem clearly.

### Weaknesses
1. MOPOMDP definition. One of the paper’s main contributions is the reformulation of the organizational-design problem from a reinforcement learning (RL) perspective. While this is novel, the proposed MOPOMDP integration (which lacks references) introduces modifications to the standard framework that raise concerns about correctness, rigor, and applicability. The authors effectively force a single-agent formulation on a problem that naturally involves multiple actors across hierarchical levels, systems extensively studied in the hierarchical multi-agent RL (MARL) literature. As a result, the manuscript adopts strong, unrealistic, assumptions (e.g., actors follow discrete, deterministic policies) and leaves the composition of canonical spaces (observation, action, and state spaces) ambiguous.

Given that problem modelling is a main contribution, the proposed framework should be: (i) comprehensive, i.e., not restricted by these limiting assumptions; (ii) rigorous, with each element formally defined and motivated; and (iii) clear, so it can serve as a reliable foundation for subsequent work. I recommend the authors revise the formulation with these points in mind and connect their work with the hierarchical MARL literature when doing so.
    
2. Temporally extended actions treatment. The framework’s architecture consists of a team of LLM agents with distinct roles and incentives, coordinated by a management policy (also implemented as an LLM) that operates through higher-level incentives. Each lower-level LLM executes actions that span multiple time steps. However, the manner in which the authors handle these temporally extended actions, while claiming that the management policy can be queried at every time step, is unclear and requires a more detailed explanation and analysis. I note that the asynchronous execution of temporally extended actions in multi-actor systems is an active research area (see the MacDec-POMDP literature).

3. Lack of analysis of "hallucinations". The clinical trial scenario is motivated well, but the paper fails to study the innate limitations of the use of LLMs for their simulated scenarios. For example, "hallucinations" are a key challenge of LLMs and the proposed problem framework seems particularly sensitive to them. A reported 15\% hallucination rate is concerning, given that errors in such complex systems could lead to serious consequences, including financial losses or potential risks to patient safety in the clinical trial scenario. A more detailed discussion, including illustrative examples, would strengthen the paper and help clarify the practical implications of these errors while also identifying directions for future work.
    
4. Overall clarity. In addition to the issues described above, which contribute to a lack of clarity, multiple statements are either poorly constructed or incomplete, and pieces of information are dispersed across the paper without clear referencing. Some examples include: (i) indexing inconsistencies (line 152, the time and actor indexes are swapped; line 227, unnecessary ' for $s_{t+1}$' and missing time index for z; line 257; and multiple others throughout the main text); (ii) undefined variables (line 151, observation space O; line 158, psi); (iii) figure inaccuracies (line 278 mentions at most one outgoing edge per node but Figure 2 showcases multiple such edges); and (iv) management policy actions (Section 2.3 could be extended to explicitly specify the expected output format for each action).

### Questions
1. In line 149, defining the actor policies as discrete mappings seems quite restrictive, particularly in an organizational setting where complex actors (e.g., humans) may exhibit inherent stochasticity in their action choices. Could the authors elaborate on the rationale behind this design choice, which departs from the more general formulation of policies as distributions? I note that introducing stochasticity would indeed affect the transition function derivation in lines 164–165; however, this should not serve as the sole motivation for enforcing such a constraint. 
 
2. In line 151, the text suggests that all agents share the same observation space. Given that agents have different roles, and that in real organizations various departments typically have access to distinct channels of information, could the authors elaborate on the motivation behind this modeling choice, which again seems restrictive? 

3. The authors state in line 167, that the motivation for vectorial reward functions is "competing goals inherent in any complex organization", and proceed to integrate a set of metrics in the clinical trial example as this reward vector. However, it is unclear which metrics from Section 3.3 are actually used. Can the authors provide a clearer description of how this reward vector is constructed? 

4. Figure 5 does not specify the values of the two parameters associated with the Fixed Plan policies (Length and Stride). Furthermore, it is unclear how the authors extended Fixed Plan policies to depend on these parameters. Could the authors provide more information about this process? Without such clarification, the figure cannot be properly interpreted or taken as a meaningful result.
