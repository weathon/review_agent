## Abstract
Designing molecules that complement the 3D shape and chemical environment of the binding pocket on their biological target is a central challenge in drug design. While current generative models often treat molecular structures as rigid—using fixed atomic coordinates or abstract ligand features—they struggle to capture the continuous, interaction-driven nature of molecular recognition. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging \textit{electron density (ED)} — a continuous, physics-grounded representation encoding conformational ensembles and local chemical environments. We introduce \textbf{ED-BFN}, an SE(3)-equivariant generative model that generates 3D molecular structures conditioned on sparse, pharmacophore-annotated point clouds derived from ligand ED. This approach provides a structure-aware prior without precise atom coordinates of protein structures. Unlike existing ED-based models, ED-BFN maintains strict spatial fidelity by aligning generated atoms with underlying electronic features. Evaluated on the DUD-E benchmark, ED-BFN recovers \textbf{37/101} bioactive molecules under oracle setting (with ground-truth atom count provided) and \textbf{28/101} in fully end-to-end setting (atom count predicted from electron density integral). Furthermore,\textbf{ 45.7\% }of generated poses achieve lower docking scores compared to reference redocking poses.To our knowledge, ED-BFN is the first generative model to represent electron density condition as a point cloud, and currently achieves state-of-the-art performance on bioactive molecule recovery and docking score improvement.

### Summary
The paper describes ED-BFN, a generative model that is conditional on what is called electron density (a point cloud representation of molecular shape) supplemented with hydrogen bond features.  The model outperforms previous electron density models.

### Strengths
Conditioning on molecular shape and electrostatics is a common SBDD task.  The model design and evaluation is sound. Point clouds are, presumably, more efficient than grids.  This approach outperforms previous ED based methods.

### Weaknesses
Considering that the model is significantly outperformed by MOLCRAFT, which it is most architecturally similar to (Appendix Table 4), it is difficult to buy the argument that electron density is a better conditioner than pocket atoms.

The point cloud sampling algorithm is unclear. In Appendix A it says a uniform downsampling is applied whereas I interpret Algorithm 4 as sampling proportional to the density.  If it is a uniform sampling, then the density is basically just being used to define the isosurface of the molecular shape and the point cloud provides no density information.

While I agree that ultimately all molecular properties stem from Schroedinger's equation, the densities generated with cctbx are not that. They are essentially a bunch of atom centered Gaussians. Furthermore, calculating these densities for ligands with cctbx does not result in a map that "inherently captures conformational ensembles and local chemical environments" - this would require using experimental data. The justification for the approach, that ED captures "subtle variations in shape, charge distribution, and steric occupancy" is not well supported by the approach and evaluation, which reduces enthusiasm.

The citation for smina is wrong (and a duplicate in the references).

### Questions
Were experimental electron densities used at all? If so, can they be highlighted and explicitly compared to generate densities? That would be interesting and might increase enthusiasm for the paper.

An explicit comparison to grids would strengthen the paper - how much more efficient is grid point sampling? What is the trade-off in accuracy vs inference/training time?

What are the validity metrics? How do they compare to other conditioned generative models?

### Summary
This paper proposes ED-BFN, a 3d molecular generation model based on electron density point clouds.
Traditional SBDD relies on fixed atomic coordinates or voxelized grid inputs, which makes it difficult to capture molecular flexibility and electronic distribution features. The authors instead use electron density (ED) as a continuous and physically interpretable prior, leveraging the GeoBFN framework to generate high-fidelity 3d molecular structures.

### Strengths
The paper introduces the use of electron density (ED) point clouds as conditional inputs, replacing traditional atomic coordinates or voxelized grids.
This continuous, physics-grounded representation provides a more faithful depiction of molecular geometry and local chemical environments.

### Weaknesses
- Missing comparative metrics: While the authors claim state-of-the-art performance over ED2Mol and ECloudGen, they do not report key binding-efficiency metrics (LE, SR, PB-validity, RMSD < 2 Å) that appear in prior ED2Mol benchmarks on DUD-E and ASB-E. Without these, it is difficult to assess whether ED-BFN improves genuine binding quality or merely docking scores. Besides, 

- High computational overhead: Computing and sampling electron density using cctbx for millions of molecules is extremely expensive (≈ hours per structure). The paper lacks runtime or cost analysis, raising concerns about scalability to large datasets or Cryo-EM volumes.

- Drug-likeness degradation: Generated molecules exhibit lower QED and higher SAS scores than baselines, implying weaker chemical realism despite better docking scores. The authors should analyze whether this stems from oversized structures or bias in the density-based conditioning.

- ECloudGen as the primary baseline: Table 1 omits many key evaluation metrics for ECloudGen. It would be helpful to generate conformers (e.g., using RDKit) and perform redocking to report comparable redock scores. Without these results, it is difficult to assess whether ED-BFN truly outperforms ECloudGen on critical binding-related metrics.

- As shown in Table 4, ED-BFN underperforms key metrics compared to pocket-based drug design approaches, suggesting that the ligand-based drug design paradigm may be less promising. This discrepancy could stem from differences in training data. The authors should conduct further experiments — for example, evaluating different models trained on the same dataset — to ensure a fair comparison.

- In Table 5, comparing bioactive molecule recovery between pocket-based and ligand-based methods is not appropriate, and the comparability of their docking scores is also questionable.

### Questions
- How sensitive is ED-BFN to the resolution and sampling density of the electron density map? Would low-resolution Cryo-EM maps still yield meaningful conditioning?
- What is the computational cost of using cctbx for density generation and sampling at scale, and how does it compare to coordinate-based models?
- Can the authors analyze why drug-likeness (QED/SAS) degrades and whether multi-objective training could balance docking and chemical plausibility?

### Summary
The paper describes an equivariant generative model for 3D molecular structures conditioned on point clouds derived from electron density. The work attempts to improve upon existing approaches to generation of molecular structure based on electron density. Specific changes include switching to point cloud samples of electron density instead of grid-based representation and annotation of point cloud envelop with various descriptors.

### Strengths
It's nice to see development of the ideas leveraging electron density for generative modeling of molecules. The model architecture is interesting and ambition to model geometries of molecules in actual environments of target pockets instead of SMILES is commendable.

### Weaknesses
Sampling core regions of charge density ignores information about the regions responsible for non-covalent interactions that constrain docking. It is puzzling why this choice is made because it ignores the most interesting aspects of working with experimentally mapped charge densities. Why not just sample simple normal distributions around nuclear positions instead?

Given how electronic structure of molecules works, the authors simply cannot afford the statement that their model "maintains strict spatial fidelity by aligning generated atoms with underlying electronic features" - they discarded all meaningful electronic features.

### Questions
Please provide comparison of model performance with point cloud, full voxeled representation, and point clouds sampled on the isosurfaces enveloping electron density.

### Summary
This paper proposes ED-BFN, a generative model that designs 3D molecules conditioned on electron density (ED) point clouds. The key idea is to represent the binding environment as a sparse, pharmacophore-labeled point cloud sampled from an ED map, then generate ligands using a GeoBFN-based network. Experiments on the DUD-E benchmark show improved recovery of active compounds and better docking scores compared to existing ED-based methods like ED2Mol and ECloudGen.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  

* Using electron density point clouds as a conditioning signal is physically meaningful. It could help bridge coordinate-based and density-based modeling.

* The paper includes a wide range of metrics (docking, QED/SAS, strain energy, recovery rate) and compares against multiple recent baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The biggest problem is the unrealistic evaluation setup used in this paper.  The “oracle” mode uses the electron density of the co-crystallized ligand as input — something you wouldn’t have in a real design task. Even in the “soft” mode, the ED still comes from known ligands rather than protein pockets or experimental maps. This makes the results optimistic and not directly comparable to true de novo generation.

2. The authors try to filter overlapping structures by RMSD, but chemical similarity filtering isn’t done. With millions of training samples, there’s a real risk that similar compounds appear in both train and test.

3. The overall novelty is limited. The main contribution is changing the conditioning signal to point clouds. The generative backbone (GeoBFN) and the overall framework are borrowed from existing work. It would be stronger if they systematically showed why point clouds outperform voxel grids or coordinate-based inputs.

4. The generated molecules have worse QED/SAS scores than baselines, which suggests they might look “fit” geometrically but not chemically realistic.

### Questions
1. In the abstract, you write that “current generative models often rely on discrete atomic coordinates ...”
This feels misleading — most modern 3D models (like Pocket2Mol, TargetDiff, MolCRAFT, etc.) already operate on continuous 3D coordinates and explicitly model interactions. 

2. You describe ED-BFN as “the first ED-based generative model to represent electron density.” But ED2Mol (Nat. Mach. Intell. 2025) and ECloudGen (bioRxiv 2024) already generate molecules directly from electron density maps. Could you clarify what exactly is new here?
