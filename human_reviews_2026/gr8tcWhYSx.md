- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. 
The distributions can be regarded as governed by a time structure which itself may be subject to some probabilistic law.
Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments  from each individual sample.
These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure.
In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures.
To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset.
The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series.
To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space.
Learning the data-specific eigenvalues has the natural interpretation of weighting up frequency components responsible for distributional discrepancies.
TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models.
Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. 
Notably, it yields 33.3\% and 55.3\% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. 
In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60\% -70\% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.

### Summary
The paper addresses distribution shift in non-stationary time-series forecasting by operating in the frequency domain and learning stationarity-aware weights that emphasize stable spectral components while suppressing non-stationary ones. The authors propose a lightweight, plug-and-play Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO). A Bochner/Mercer analysis links the Fourier-induced kernel to the learned weights, which can be interpreted as data-specific eigenvalues, providing a principled justification for the design. Empirically, TIFO yields consistent improvements across multiple datasets and architectures with modest computational overhead. Overall, the framework is clear, coherent, and practically relevant, while some design choices invite further analysis.

### Strengths
1. The motivation for this paper is well-founded, the problem analysis is clear, and the writing is coherent.

2. The Bochner/Mercer approach provides a clear theoretical perspective, interpreting the learned frequency weights as the eigenvalues ​​of a kernel function induced in the spectral domain.

3. A lightweight pre-network module is proposed that can be combined with various backbone networks (e.g., linear, Transformer-style).

### Weaknesses
1. This paper proposes a frequency-based approach but does not adequately compare/contrast it with recent frequency-domain methods [1, 2, 3]. In particular, [1, 3] appear to address the overlap problem, requiring focused discussion and empirical comparison.

2. Many forecasting pipelines normalize their inputs and perform forecasts in this normalized space; these are not primarily designed to estimate the time-varying statistics $(\mu_t,\sigma_t)$ for each window.

3. This paper does not discuss how/when to recalculate $S$ in the presence of distribution drift, the appropriate window size/threshold, and the impact on latency/efficiency.

### Questions
1. Is the primary goal to supervise the prediction of $P(y\mid x)$ or to condition/regularize $P(x\mid t)$? If the latter, is $t$ a relative time index (e.g., window position) or an absolute timestamp? How is $t$ handled during testing?

2. What are the advantages of Equation 1 compared to directly learning $\lambda_r,\lambda_i$ as free parameters?

3. Since $S$ is computed on the training set and then passed to the model (step 3 in Phase I), what is the refresh frequency in the presence of drift?

4. $S$ is the ratio of the frequency mean to the variance. Why does it measure stability? Can you provide a more detailed analysis?

### Summary
The paper proposes TIFO (Time-Invariant Frequency Operator) for distribution-shift–robust time-series forecasting. It first computes dataset-level frequency stability scores.  During training, each input is FFT’d and its real/imag parts are reweighted by functions of those stability scores before an iFFT returns the sequence to the time domain; the downstream forecaster is trained end-to-end. The method is motivated by a kernel view: learned frequency weights correspond to eigenvalues of a positive-definite kernel induced by the Fourier basis, providing an interpretability angle. Experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks (ETT variants, Electricity, Traffic, Weather) with several strong backbones show consistent MSE/MAE gains and notable training-time savings versus normalization-based and spectrum-editing baselines.

### Strengths
(i) This paper introduces a dataset-level notion of frequency stability (mean/variance across samples) and uses it to reweight real/imag FFT components during training. 

(ii) The two-stage pipeline is easy to follow; the paper provides algorithm pseudocode and a clean description of how stability scores are computed and mapped to frequency weights. 

(iii) The operator is plug-and-play, requires minimal architectural change, and is computationally light, making it practical for adoption.

### Weaknesses
(i) The method assumes frequency bands that are stable on the training set remain so at test time. Abrupt shifts (new cycles, policy changes, outages) may violate this, and the paper offers no online update or detection mechanism.

(ii) Reweighting real/imag parts independently ignores cross-channel phase structure and inter-series coherence; this could distort multivariate dynamics when phase relations carry signal. This paper do not

(iii) Sensitivity to window length, FFT resolution, windowing function, zero-padding, and stride is not systematically studied; frequency leakage could bias stability estimates. More ablation studies maybe needed.

### Questions
(i) Can the stability scores be updated online (e.g., EMA over recent batches) without leaking test labels? What failure modes arise if stability drifts?

(ii) How sensitive are results to FFT hyperparameters (window size, hop, windowing, zero-padding)? Please include a robust ablation table.

(iii) Why choose μ/σ specifically? How do alternatives (coefficient of variation variants, entropy of magnitudes, mutual information with targets) compare?

### Summary
The paper proposes TIFO, a plug-and-play spectral weighting module for time-series forecasting. TIFO learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum at the dataset level, aiming to amplify stationary components and suppress non-stationary ones to mitigate train–test distribution shift. The authors argue that the DFT implicitly induces an eigendecomposition in frequency space and interpret the learned weights as data-specific eigenvalues. Empirically, they report strong results and also claim 60–70% compute reductions versus baselines.

### Strengths
1. The idea of dataset-level spectral reweighting to favor stationary components is intuitive and can be attached to many backbones with low engineering overhead. 

2. Reported improvements across many settings, plus substantial compute savings, suggest practical impact if substantiated with strong measurement methodology.

3. Framing distribution shift via frequency-domain structure is appealing.

4. The writing is generally clear.

### Weaknesses
1. Lines 188–189: It is unclear how the preceding analysis leads to the conclusion that stationary components should be enhanced while non-stationary components should be suppressed. The logical connection between the theoretical argument and this design choice should be elaborated.

2. Reducing the weights of non-stationary components may limit the model’s predictive upper bound, since important information carried by these components could be lost. Please discuss the potential trade-off between robustness and expressive capacity.

3. Frequency weighting modifies amplitude and may implicitly influence phase after inverse transformation, particularly when using finite-length windows. The paper should examine possible phase distortions and boundary effects, and clarify whether overlap-add or tapering techniques are employed during reconstruction.

### Questions
1. Does TIFO have any theoretical guarantee for its improvement in forecasting accuracy?

2. How does TIFO handle multivariate inputs? Is there a joint reweighting mechanism across channels to capture cross-spectral dependencies, or are the weights learned independently per channel?

### Summary
The paper proposes TIFO (Time-Invariant Frequency Operator) for stationarity-aware representation learning in time-series forecasting. The key idea is to estimate dataset-level frequency stationarity and use it to reweight Fourier coefficients before feeding sequences into standard backbones (DLinear, PatchTST, iTransformer). Conceptually, the method argues that the DFT induces a frequency-space eigen-decomposition; learning data-specific eigenvalues (via small MLPs that output real/imaginary weights) emphasizes stationary components and suppresses non-stationary ones, thereby reducing train–test spectral shift and improving generalization. Empirically, the paper reports 18× top-1 and 6× top-2 wins across 28 settings, large gains on ETTm2, and 60~70% runtime reductions relative to certain baselines.

### Strengths
- This work focuses on the practical and important issue of *non-stationarity* in time-series forecasting, providing a frequency-domain perspective that complements conventional normalization approaches focused on low-order statistics..

- This work proposes a tightly integrated, plug-and-play pipeline: Stage-I computes frequency- and channel-wise stationarity $S(k,c)$​; Stage-II maps SSS through two lightweight MLPs to produce real/imag frequency weights that reweight DFT coefficients before iDFT, ensuring real-valued reconstructions.

- The proposed TIFO module is lightweight, generalizable, and can be easily integrated into diverse backbones (DLinear, PatchTST, iTransformer) without architectural modification.

### Weaknesses
(i) The conceptual novelty, while interesting, mainly lies in *reinterpreting normalization through frequency reweighting* rather than establishing a fundamentally new principle. The relation to prior spectral or stationarity-aware frameworks (e.g., FAN, FedFormer, FILM, FredFormer) is not deeply analyzed, leaving unclear how TIFO’s weighting differs from existing frequency-domain normalization or filtering approaches.

(ii) The paper underexplores sensitivity of key design choices: the definition/estimation of $S$ (mean/std vs. robust variants, windowing) and frequency resolution $K$. Existing ablations mainly randomize the initialization vector $s$, leaving robustness/controllability less clear.  

(iii) The paper does not explicitly analyze how TIFO addresses the concrete shortcomings of prior approaches and why its design succeeds where they fail.  For example, beyond stating that time-domain normalization focuses on low-order statistics and may leave spectral shifts unresolved, and that frequency methods like top-k masking risk discarding informative peaks, the paper does not map TIFO’s dataset-level stationarity weighting and per-frequency learned coefficients to specific failure modes (e.g., residual train–test spectral shift after RevIN/SAN; over-suppression or mis-selection in FAN;  differences from FILM/FedFormer/FredFormer’s spectral handling).  Targeted comparisons or case studies (error breakdowns, where TIFO helps vs. hurts) would clarify the mechanism and strengthen the conceptual contribution.

### Questions
Please see 'weakness', which simply can be summarised as:

(i) Please elaborate on the core conceptual novelty of TIFO beyond reinterpreting normalization through frequency reweighting, and clarify how it fundamentally differs from existing spectral or stationarity-aware frameworks (e.g., FAN, FedFormer, FILM, FredFormer). 

(ii) Please provide a systematic sensitivity analysis of key design and implementation choices, including the definition and estimation of $S$ (e.g., mean/std vs. robust variants, windowing strategy) and frequency resolution $K$​. 

(iii) Please expand the Related Work or an analysis section to explicitly map how each TIFO component addresses the concrete shortcomings of prior approaches and substantiate these explanations with targeted comparisons or failure-mode case studies (e.g., where TIFO helps or fails).
