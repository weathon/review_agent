## Abstract
Phishing website detection traditionally relies on static heuristics or few-shot classifiers, which struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving attack patterns. Recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs) but still use prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that under-utilize LLM reasoning. In this work, we introduce MemoPhishAgent, the first memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent framework that dynamically orchestrates five specialized tools to gather the evidence needed for phishing detection. Central to our design is an episodic memory system that captures past reasoning trajectories and final judgments, supporting three retrieval modes: (1) majority-vote for instant, high-confidence decisions, (2) in-context exemplars for guided LLM prompting, and (3) full ReAct for novel threats. Crucially, we evaluate under realistic conditions on two public benchmark datasets. Experiment results show that MemoPhishAgent outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across four metrics, achieving significantly higher recall while keeping latency manageable. Analysis of memory design demonstrates that episodic memory boosts recall by over 20% while reducing computational overhead. An ablation study further validates the necessity of the agent-based approach by comparing MemoPhishAgent to two simplified variants. Together, our results show that combining multi-modal reasoning with episodic memory yields robust, adaptable phishing detection in realistic user-exposure settings.

### Summary
This paper introduces MemoPhishAgent, a novel memory-augmented, multi-modal LLM agent framework designed for phishing URL detection. The agent dynamically orchestrates five specialized tools to gather evidence. Its core contribution is an episodic memory system that stores and retrieves past reasoning trajectories to inform current decisions. This memory supports three retrieval modes: majority-vote for recurring threats, in-context exemplars for similar cases, and a full ReAct loop for novel threats. To validate their approach, the authors introduce a new dataset, SocPhish, crawled from social media. Experiments conducted on SocPhish and two public benchmarks demonstrate that MemoPhishAgent outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in recall.

### Strengths
- The core idea of an agent that learns from its own reasoning history (episodic memory) to improve phishing detection is novel and promising.
- The paper provides a thorough evaluation on three different datasets, including a newly created one that reflects a more realistic threat landscape. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the value of each component.
- The method shows substantial improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in recall, which is a critical metric for this security application.

### Weaknesses
- The reported average latency of \~38 seconds per URL poses a major challenge for practical, real-time deployment. This is significantly slower than the MLLM baseline (\~12s) and would likely be too slow for scanning large volumes of URLs in a production environment. The paper does not offer a clear path to mitigating this critical bottleneck.
- The paper overlooks the crucial aspect of memory management and scalability. In a real-world scenario, the episodic memory would grow indefinitely, leading to increased retrieval times and storage costs. The lack of a strategy for pruning, summarizing, or managing this growing memory store is a significant omission in the proposed framework.

### Questions
- The proposed method is over 3 times slower than the MLLM baseline. Could you provide a more detailed analysis to justify this significant increase in latency? In what specific real-world scenarios would this trade-off be acceptable? Are there plans to reduce this latency to a more practical level?
- What is your long-term vision for managing the episodic memory? Without a mechanism for pruning or summarizing, the system's performance will inevitably degrade over time. Can you propose a concrete strategy to address this?

### Summary
The paper introduces MemoPhishAgent, a memory-augmented multimodal LLM agent for phishing detection. It dynamically orchestrates five tools — text crawling, screenshot analysis, image inspection, target-link extraction, and intelligent search — within a ReAct loop. The agent employs an episodic memory module based on keyword retrieval and a three-tier reasoning strategy (majority voting → in-context examples → full ReAct). Evaluations on both public benchmarks (TR-OP, DynaPD) and a proprietary SocPhish dataset demonstrate improved F1 and recall performance over prior state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
### 1. Well-designed tool suite for the task.
The proposed five-tool composition — text crawling, screenshot inspection, image verification, target-link extraction, and intelligent search — is well aligned with the phishing-detection problem. Each tool is justified and its contribution is evaluated through ablation experiments (Table 3).

### 2. Clearly layered memory strategy.
The three-tier policy (majority voting → in-context exemplars → full ReAct reasoning), combined with keyword-based summarization and a FAISS index for retrieval, is conceptually clear and technically sound.

### 3. Real-world data.
The use of the SocPhish dataset, collected from social-platform contexts, shows a commendable effort to reflect realistic “user-exposure” scenarios beyond standard public benchmarks (TR-OP, DynaPD).

I believe that as LLMs and MLLMs continue to advance, this task becomes increasingly important and challenging. The authors’ data collection effort and their proposed new approach show promising potential.

### Weaknesses
### 1. Lack of the novelty
The paper repeatedly claims to be the first memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent, yet prior work on memory-enabled or multi-tool agents (also cited by the authors) already explored similar structures. The distinction from previous “deterministic” or “static” agents is described conceptually, not experimentally. No quantitative comparison to these baselines under identical conditions is provided.

### 2. Limited and Potentially Biased Baselines
Only two LLM-based baselines (PhishLLM, MLLM) are compared. Strong traditional or hybrid methods (e.g., URLTran) are excluded on the basis of “inferior performance” or “unavailable code,” which undermines fairness.

“Reference-based” knowledge systems are said to underperform and thus are omitted, even though MemoPhishAgent’s majority-voting memory is conceptually similar to such retrieval paradigms.

### 3. Metric Reporting Bias
Evaluation focuses on a single operating point optimized for recall/F1. For a balanced understanding, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, and cost-sensitive recall curves should be reported.

### 4. Inconsistency of LLM Agent Behavior
A notable issue—unaddressed in the paper—is the inconsistency of the LLM agent’s reasoning and action selection across identical or semantically similar inputs.
Because the ReAct loop depends on stochastic LLM generations without deterministic control (e.g., temperature > 0), the same sample may produce different tool sequences and conflicting conclusions.
This inconsistency undermines reliability, especially in a security-critical application such as phishing detection. 

The authors should: Quantify decision variance under repeated inference (e.g., 10 runs per sample).
Evaluate robustness under prompt paraphrasing and equivalent representations.
Clarify if any sampling control or output normalization (e.g., function-call schema enforcement) was applied.

Without such measures, MemoPhishAgent cannot guarantee stable judgments, which is a key weakness in deployment contexts.

**I suggest additional experiments for strong paper.**

1. Broaden baselines (URLTran, hybrid URL + LLM models, recent reference-based retrieval methods).
2. Memory hygiene tests with controlled noise injection and forgetting strategies. 
3. Report PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Recall@k vs cost curves.

### Summary
This paper proposes MemoPhishAgent, a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent framework for phishing URL detection. The system leverages five specialized tools orchestrated dynamically by an agent that incorporates an episodic memory for retrieving historical reasoning trajectories. MemoPhishAgent is evaluated on both public datasets and a new social-media-based phishing dataset, and the results show it outperforms several SOTA baselines in terms of recall and F1 score.

### Strengths
1. The proposed approach introduces an agent architecture enabling dynamic tool selection and multi-step reasoning, which is a promising direction for phishing detection.
2. The integration of episodic memory potentially enhances efficiency and adaptability by leveraging previous analysis experiences.
3. The inclusion of a real-world social media dataset makes the method more relevant for practical scenarios.
4. The ablation and sensitivity studies provide valuable insights into module contribution.

### Weaknesses
I believe the most significant weakness of this paper is the lack of transparency regarding the implementation details of the entire approach, as well as insufficient analysis of abnormal experimental observations.
1. It is unclear why the crawl content tool parses HTML into markdown before analysis. Since the goal is to analyze keywords, plain HTML could be sufficient. The manuscript does not provide experimental justification demonstrating that markdown processing is superior to directly using HTML. 
2. The overall implementation process described in the paper is non-transparent. For example, important details such as the specific design and operation of each tool, the formats of inputs and outputs, the versions of the LLMs used, and the accuracy or reliability of individual tools are all missing or unclear. This lack of transparency makes it very difficult to assess the reliability and reproducibility of the proposed approach.
3. The authors do not publish the details of their own SocPhish dataset or provide access for reproducibility. Table 1 shows that MemoPhishAgent achieves much better results on the SocPhish dataset compared to baselines, but the advantage is far less on public datasets (TR-OP and DynaPD), and for some metrics, baselines even outperform the proposed method. This raises concerns about generalization and data representativeness. 
4. The reasons why the Monolithic LLM architecture performs worse than the deterministic workflow agent are not well analyzed or explained. Additionally, there are cases where the Monolithic LLM matches or surpasses the proposed method, but the authors do not discuss these results. 
5. It is not specified what engine or data source is used for intelligent search. If an external web search is applied, there is a risk that the search may directly retrieve the ground-truth answer (e.g., whether a URL is phishing), rather than relying solely on agent-based inference. This could affect the fairness and validity of the experimental evaluation. The paper does not discuss this risk or explain what steps were taken to avoid answer leakage during intelligent search.
6. The episodic memory module continuously accumulates past cases and reuses them in majority voting, but there is no mechanism to ensure the accuracy or correctness of previously stored decisions. If erroneous verdicts enter the memory, the majority-vote scheme might amplify these errors, potentially leading to false positives or negatives in future detections. The paper does not describe any strategy for memory cleansing, error correction, or aging out irrelevant experiences.

### Questions
1. The main innovation and contribution relative to previous agent-based or multi-modal phishing detectors is not sufficiently clarified. What exactly is improved over works such as PhishAgent or other agentic approaches?

### Summary
This paper introduces MemoPhishAgent, a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent framework for phishing URL detection. The system dynamically orchestrates five specialized tools (crawl content, check screenshot, check image, intelligent search, and extract targets) to gather evidence for phishing detection. The key innovation is an episodic memory system that captures past reasoning trajectories and supports three retrieval modes: majority-vote for high-confidence decisions, in-context exemplars for guided prompting, and full ReAct for novel threats. The authors evaluate their approach on three datasets including a newly collected SocPhish dataset from social media platforms, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines with 27% improvement in recall while maintaining manageable latency.

### Strengths
Originality: The work presents a creative combination of episodic memory with multi-modal agent reasoning for phishing detection. The three-tier memory retrieval strategy (no match, partial match, full match) is innovative and well-motivated. The problem formulation of using historical reasoning trajectories to improve detection is novel in the cybersecurity domain.

Quality: The experimental design is comprehensive with proper ablation studies demonstrating the necessity of each component. The evaluation across multiple datasets provides good coverage, and the tool usage analysis (Figure 3a) offers valuable insights into agent behavior. The statistical reporting with mean and standard deviation enhances credibility.

Clarity: The paper is well-written with clear motivation and methodology. Figure 1 effectively illustrates the system architecture, and the three-tier memory retrieval strategy is explained clearly. The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are appropriate for the task.
Significance: The work addresses a critical cybersecurity challenge with practical implications. The introduction of the SocPhish dataset provides value to the research community by reflecting real-world phishing threats. The 27% improvement in recall represents a substantial practical advancement that could reduce successful phishing attacks.

### Weaknesses
Scalability Problems: The biggest issue is that this system is too slow for real-world use. Taking 38 seconds per URL means it can't handle the millions of URLs that companies process daily. The memory system keeps growing as it processes more URLs, but the authors don't explain how this affects performance over time or how much storage it needs. There's no plan for removing outdated information, which could make the system slower and less accurate as it fills up with old data.

Security Vulnerabilities: The system showed a concerning 11% drop in accuracy when attackers used simple prompt injection attacks. This suggests that determined attackers could easily fool the system by crafting special inputs. Since the system relies on multiple tools working together, errors in one tool could cascade through the entire process. Even worse, attackers might be able to "poison" the memory by getting the system to remember their malicious examples as legitimate patterns.

### Questions
How does the episodic memory system's performance scale with increasing memory size, and what memory management strategies can maintain effectiveness at production scale while handling enterprise traffic of 100K-1M URLs per day?
