## Abstract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the standard for learning on graphs, yet they have limited expressive power, often expressed in terms of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy or within the framework of first-order logic. In this context, topological neural networks (TNNs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative for graph representation learning. By incorporating higher-order relational structures into message-passing schemes, TNNs offer higher representational power than traditional GNNs. However, a fundamental question remains open: _what is the logical expressiveness of TNNs?_ Answering this allows us to characterize precisely which binary classifiers TNNs can represent. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing isomorphism tests derived from the underlying mechanisms of general TNNs. We introduce and investigate the power of higher-order variants of WL-based tests for combinatorial complexes, called $k$-CCWL test. In addition, we introduce the topological counting logic $TC_{k}$, an extension of standard counting logic featuring a novel pairwise counting quantifier $\exists^{N}(x_i,x_j) \varphi(x_i,x_j),$ which explicitly quantifies pairs $(x_i, x_j)$ satisfying property $\varphi$. We rigorously prove the exact equivalence: $\text{k-CCWL} \equiv \text{TC}_{k{+}2} \equiv \text{Topological }(k{+}2)\text{-pebble game}.$ These results establish a logical expressiveness theory for TNNs.

### Summary
This paper develops the first formal theory describing how expressive Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) are. It introduces the Combinatorial Complex Weisfeiler–Leman (k-CCWL) test, the Topological Counting Logic ($TC_k$) with a new pairwise counting quantifier, and a Topological Pebble Game. The main result proves that $(k-)$CCWL $\equiv$ TC$_{k+2}$​ $\equiv$ Topological $(k+2)$-Pebble Game, creating a unified logic–game–algorithm framework that precisely characterizes the expressive power of TNNs and shows how it extends beyond classical graph neural networks.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of $TC_k$ ​ with a pairwise counting quantifier  $\exists^{\geq N}(x_i, x_j)$ tailored to the upper/lower adjacency flows in TNNs is novel and well-motivated by message passing that aggregates over intermediary face/co-face pairs. This is a clean, logic-first abstraction of a topological operation.
2. Establishing expressiveness bounds for TNNs on combinatorial complexes is timely and important: it clarifies when and why TNNs can surpass GNNs and gives a yardstick for future TNN variants (i.e., with persistence, sheaves, or equivariance). The "pairwise-counting view" should inform model design and benchmarking going forward.

### Weaknesses
1. **Tightness of $TC_{k+2}$:** The $+2$ variable overhead is plausible but not yet proved tight. Add a lower-bound separation ($TC_{k+1}$ ​ vs. $TC_{k+2}$) or, minimally, a conjecture plus partial evidence (i.e., a candidate pair indistinguishable by $TC_{k+1}$).
2. The broadcast-anchor argument and "identical-vs-disjoint" global signatures rely on uniform ACCs. Please either: (1) show the theorem under weaker conditions, or (2) give a counterexample and make the limitation prominent (incl. a discussion of how non-uniform ACCs appear in practice).
3. **Algorithmic complexity \& stabilization bounds:** Provide explicit bounds for: (1) Per-round cost of $k-CCWL$ with the double-shift ($O(|X|^{k+2}$)?); (2) Number of rounds to stabilization in terms of $|X|, \rho, k$.
4. Can you please provide 1 or 2 toy ACC pairs and explicit $TC_{k+2}$ ​ formulas that $k$-CCWL detects but $k$-WL on graphs cannot. This would concretely demonstrate the step from vertex-adjacency to topological relations.

### Questions
1. **Why the "+2 variables" gap is tight:** You prove $k$-CCWL $\equiv$ $TC_{k+2}$ $\equiv$ topological $(k+2)$-pebble game. Please provide a separation example showing $TC_{k+1}$ ​ is insufficient - i.e., a pair of ACCs indistinguishable by $TC_{k+1}$ ​but separated by $k-CCWL/TC_{k+2}$. This would make the +2 blow-up not just sufficient but necessary (currently this is motivated by the "double shift" and pairwise counting intuition.)
2. **Scope: which TNN families are covered exactly?** Equivalences are stated for "general message-passing TNNs" with injective aggregators and the four adjacencies $N_B ​ ,N_C ​ ,N_{\uparrow} ​, N_{\downarrow}$. Please clarify which concrete architectures (i.e., CWN, TopoTune variants, sheaf-style updates, etc.) are exactly simulated by $k$-CCWL, and which require extra assumptions (i.e., uniformity, binary labels, injectivity). A small coverage table would help practitioners map models to the theory.
3. **Uniform ACC assumption in Prop./Thm. 3.1:** The "broadcast anchor" gadget yields the identical-vs-disjoint global signature property for uniform ACCs. Is uniformity essential? Please give a counterexample without uniformity or relax the condition (i.e., "every non-0 cell has $\ge$ 1 facet") and state the minimal requirement.
4. **Complexity and convergence of $k$-CCWL:** (1) What is the per-iteration complexity in $|X|, k$, and the maximum rank $\rho$, given the "double shift" considers all $(\alpha, \beta) ⁣ \in ⁣ X^2$?; (2) Do you prove a polynomial stabilization bound (as for $k$-WL on graphs) for ACCs? If so, please state it; if not, clarify whether only finite convergence is established.
5. **Game rules vs. pairwise quantification:** In the topological pebble game, Spoiler picks sets of pairs $P \subseteq X^2$ . Please add a short completeness sketch that shows every $TC_k$ ​formula with a pairwise quantifier translates to a finite-round Spoiler strategy with $k$ pebbles (and conversely), making the alignment fully explicit (beyond the proof sketch).
6. **Expressiveness vs. standard $k$-WL baselines:** Since $C_{k+1} ​\equiv $k$-WL$ on graphs, the $+2$ variable shift for ACCs is intuitive. Please add a diagram/table contrasting: $k-WL \leftrightarrow C_{k+1}$​ (graphs) vs. $k-CCWL \leftrightarrow TC_{k+2}$ ​(ACCs), plus a simple ACC "witness" where $k-CCWL$ strictly dominates $k-WL$.
7. **Worked micro-examples:** The running example in Fig. 1 (2-CCWL on a triangle with ranks/colors) is helpful - please add 1-2 non-trivial pairs of ACCs separated by 2-CCWL but not by 1-CCWL, with the corresponding $TC_3$ ​formulas and two-pebble strategies spelled out.

### Summary
The paper presents new expressiveness characterisations in the realm of topological deep learning, a recent field dealing with the design of  neural network architectures for higher-order relational data. The main result is an equivalence triad which mirrors results in the expressive power of machine learning on graphs. This results connects isomorphism testing, a fragment of FOL, and pebble games.

In particular, the authors introduce a novel: (i) variant of the k-WL test adapted to combinatorial complexes (CCs); (ii) "topological" fragment of FOL with k-variables and counting quantifiers; (iii) "topological pebble game".

(i) The authors introduce the k-CCWL test hierarchy to distinguish non-isomorphic combinatorial complexes. The main novelty wrt to the standard k-WL test, consists in simultaneously tracking two cell substitution per tuple position. The authors formalise this aspect trying to link it to the main feature of typical upper- and lower- neighbourhoods in topological neural networks, which introduce the feature of the boundary or co-boundary cells shared between two adjacent ones.

(ii) The authors introduce a "topological counting logic" which resembles the one studied in graphs, but with the main difference being that counting quantifiers are pairwise. The authors show an equivalence between the k-CCWL  and this fragment with k+2 variables.

(iii) The authors introduce a variant of the pebble game over combinatorial complexes, where the main difference w.r.t. the "standard" pebble games is that players select and mark couples of cells (instead of nodes). The authors show the equivalence between the k-variable topological counting logic and the topological k-pebble game in terms of the duplicator winning strategies.

Finally the authors show the equivalence between the k-CCWL test and the (k+2)-pebble game.

### Strengths
[S1] The work is relevant and timely. It contributes a set of insights and tools which, going forward, will support better and more informed quantifications of expressive power for topological neural network architectures.

[S2] The paper is presented in a precise way, the authors give sufficient background to grasp the relevance of the contribution and the existing, base results in the realm of graphs.

[S3] The way the fundamental expressiveness characterisations are extended is intriguing and interesting, that is, the "shift" to the pairwise paradigm in counting quantifiers, pebbles, tuple variable substitutions.

### Weaknesses
[W1] The main results are relevant, but remain rather abstract.
- [W1.1] The authors does not provide evidence of how they can, for example, help characterise the expressiveness of existing architectures. Do these tools already support some, even preliminary, architectural stratification?
- [W1.2] Does the new counting logic allow to grasp some intuition on what kind of topological structural properties methods can or cannot capture?
- [W1.3] Other than completing the "triad", what kind of interesting intuition can we draw from the newly introduced pebble game?

[W2] Related to W1.1 – The paper does not connect to the learning aspect at all. Generally speaking this is not an easy endeavour, and even in the graph literature, this connection is rather unexplored. A precise characterisation is clearly out of scope, but considering the current venue scope ... _experimentally_, are expressiveness insights minimally reflected in practice, even in some synthetic benchmark?

[W3] A recent paper explores expressiveness limits of topological neural networks: Eitan et al, 2025 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05486). It would be extremely interesting, other than expected, to discuss at least some links between the two works. The authors does not seem to do that.

[W4] Generally speaking, the paper could appear not to be accessible to all readers, being rather theory heavy. I believe something that could significantly improve the quality of the paper is to provide more intuitions and illustrations.
- [W4.1] This "shift" to the pairwise paradigm that marks a difference w.r.t. standard expressiveness characterisation is only intuitively justified in lines 63 through 67, but I believe this is one of the most important aspects behind the contribution. The authors should give it more emphasis and illustrate it better to ground the following contributions.
- [W4.2] Lines 251 -- 257 – This paragraph is rather unclear; what is the intuition behind the broadcast anchors?

[W5] Minor – some references are not up to date and still report preprints instead of publication venues.

Overall, with the caveat that I have not checked the math in the proofs reported in appendix, I lean towards recommending acceptance, but addressing the above weaknesses would positively strengthen my evaluation.

### Questions
[Q1] Lines 251 -- 257: Can the authors please explain the idea of the broadcast anchor? this paragraph appears rather detached from the rest of the paper and, to the best of my knowledge, this is also something different w.r.t. the standard k-WL test.

[Q2] Can the authors explain why the atps are injected in multisets in every refinement step, even in standard k-WL? This is not something standard, to the best of my knowledge (see, e.g., Eq. 4).

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the so-called logical expressiveness of topological neural networks. They first define the k-combinatorial complex WL test (k-CCWL) on Page 5, via adapting the k-WL test for graphs to topological networks. Next, they show that for uniform attributed combinatorial complexes (ACCs), the output representations of two objects via an instance k-CCWL are either completely disjoint sets or completely equal sets. 
Here, 'uniformity' allows us to define some notion similar to neighborhoods in graphs, and thus one can then extend message passing to such neural networks. 


Next, they define topological counting logic TC-k, as well as topological k-pebble games, where the latter is a game defined to mimic the definition of topological logic. 

Here are the main results: In Theorems 4.1, they prove that if for every formula in topological logic TC-(k+2), two given ACCs are consistent, then the k-CCWL coloring of them will also be the same. Next, together in Theorem 5.1 and Theorem 5.2, they show that having a winning strategy for a particular player in (k+2)-pebble game is equivalent to the topological logic TC-(k+2) assumption, completing the equivalence of different notions of expressiveness. This is given in Corollary 5.3 and Theorem 5.4. See also Eq. 6 that summarizes the main contributions of the paper.

### Strengths
- contributions to the theory of topological neural networks, which is of potential interest to this part of the community

- Nice and clean theoretical results, solid paper at the intersection of math and AI

### Weaknesses
- This paper, while having great contributions, is less accessible to the community. It is hard to follow.

### Questions
I completely read the main body of this work and found that it is a great paper. It contains solid mathematical contributions characterizing the expressive power of topological neural networks via different approaches: (1) methods similar to k-WL for graphs, (2) the introduced notion of pebble games, (3) the definition of the topological logic classes of order k. This contributed to the theory side of geometry and topology in neural networks. 



Unfortunately, this paper, while having great contributions, has a major problem. It is less accessible to the community. As ICLR and even the geometry community within AI have different backgrounds, it is necessary to make sure that a paper with that level of great math contributions is accessible. The author should make sure that a reader, even if they barely know geometry and topology, could understand the main contribution and the message. The first few pages of the paper have to deliver the message to people who do not have much background in theory, yet they want to know what the contributions of the paper are. For instance, for a practitioner, the paper is absolutely difficult to read and follow.


I suggest that the author extensively reconsider the first few pages of this paper and rewrite them so that it is more accessible. That way, the paper will get more audience and will have more impact, given its great contributions to the math of AI. As a result of this, for the current version of the paper, I recommend rejection. 



- Typo, Line 91: There is nothing called 'Theorem 3.1' in the paper, which is cited multiple times in the paper. Probably the authors meant 'Proposition 3.1.' Please make sure to correct all such typos in the paper.

### Summary
The paper develops a rigorous theory of the logical expressiveness of topological neural networks (TNNs) operating on attributed combinatorial complexes (ACCs). It introduces:

- k-CCWL: a higher-order Weisfeiler–Leman-style test for combinatorial complexes that refines colors on k-tuples via a “double shift sequence,” aligning with message passing that aggregates via pairs across upper/lower neighborhoods.

- TCk: a new finite first-order logic fragment endowed with a pairwise counting quantifier designed to capture the pairwise aggregation semantics inherent to TNNs.

- Topological pebble game: a game-theoretic characterization mirroring TCk, but with rules adapted to pairwise placements/relations in complexes.

The central theoretical result is the exact equivalence among these three viewpoints.
This yields a clean expressiveness characterization akin to the classical WL–counting logic–pebble game triad for GNNs, and explains why expressivity increases with k for higher-order TNNs. The paper also proves a “broadcast anchor” property for uniform ACCs, establishing an identical-vs-disjoint global signature phenomenon that strengthens the isomorphism testing narrative.

### Strengths
- Originality: The paper introduces a novel pairwise counting quantifier and a tailored topological pebble game, both tailored to the unique mechanics of TNN message passing over combinatorial complexes. This goes beyond standard graph WL/FOC frameworks to a topological domain with upper/lower adjacency and boundary/co-boundary relations. The “double shift” construction and the logic–game–algorithm triad for TNNs are original and conceptually unifying.

- Quality: The theoretical development is systematic, starting from ACCs and neighbourhood systems, building k-CCWL from atomic types and multiset refinement contexts, and then matching these to TCk+2 and the pebble game through careful equivalence arguments. The appendices provide detailed proofs, and the broadcast anchor gadget for uniform ACCs is a nice technical device that clarifies the isomorphism testing behaviour.

- Clarity: The paper clearly distinguishes the four adjacency types and motivates why pairwise aggregation in TNNs necessitates pairwise counting in the logic. The stepwise definitions for atomic types, initialisation, refinement, and stabilisation are well structured, and the use of quantifier depth and alignment of refinement depth with logic/game rounds help readability.

- Significance: Establishing a precise logical expressiveness theory for TNNs is timely and valuable. It puts TNNs on similar theoretical footing to GNNs and higher-order WL variants, enabling principled reasoning about what architectures can or cannot decide. The equivalence result is likely to become a reference point for future work in topological deep learning and higher-order message passing.

### Weaknesses
- Scope restriction to uniform ACCs: Several key claims and the broadcast-anchor property depend on uniform ACCs. While understandable for technical control, it would strengthen the discussion of how results extend to non-uniform complexes and the minimal conditions needed.

- Complexity and practicality: The theoretical expressiveness results are strong, but practical guidance is limited. There’s little discussion of the computational complexity of k-CCWL on ACCs, its scaling with k and complex order, or efficient approximation methods. Concrete implications for designing more powerful TNN layers, such as beneficial pairwise aggregations or architectural motifs, could be elaborated. TNNs are often criticised for practicality due to complexity, so the increased complexity on higher orders may hinder the impact of the theoretical results.

- Empirical or constructive exemplars: Even small, instructive examples demonstrating where k-CCWL/TCk+2 distinguish structures that standard WL/GNNs can’t, especially in real TNN use-cases (e.g., hypergraphs, simplicial complexes in molecules), would increase accessibility and impact.

- Contextualisation vs. related theory: The connection to prior works on higher-order WL, counting logic, and pebble games is noted, but a more granular comparison to existing expressiveness results for cellular/cellular sheaf networks or recent “topological blind spots” analyses would better position the novelty. Making explicit how the new pairwise quantifier relates to prior graded/counting logics would help readers from finite model theory.

- Notation density: Some sections (e.g., Definition and refinement contexts with `D(t)_k(x)` and the double shift sequence) are notation-heavy. Additional figures or worked examples could reduce cognitive load.

### Questions
1.  Why do you need the broadcast-anchor? Does the isomophism test work without it? 

2. Is k-CCWL guaranteed to converge? I couldn't find relevant info in the proof.

1. Beyond uniform ACCs: Which parts of the equivalence hinge critically on uniformity? Can the broadcast-anchor identical-vs-disjoint result be generalized with weaker conditions (e.g., local facet constraints)? If not, can you provide counterexamples?


2. Tightness of the k+2 overhead: The need for k+2 variables/pebbles arises from the double shift sequence. Is k+2 provably tight, or could specific subclasses of ACCs/TNNs be captured by TCk+1? A formal lower bound on variables needed would be informative.

3. Complexity bounds: What are the computational costs of k-CCWL (and its stabilization) on ACCs of order ρ and size |X|? Are there known polynomial bounds in k, ρ, and |X|? Can you propose practical approximations that preserve the expressiveness class for typical TNN architectures?

4. Design guidance for practitioners: Given the pairwise quantifier motivation, which concrete TNN aggregation patterns (e.g., pairwise interactions via NB/NC intersections) are minimally necessary to realize the TCk+2 power? Could you sketch an architecture template that is complete for TCk+2 under injective maps?

5. Illustrative case studies: Could you add small synthetic examples where k-CCWL separates complexes that 1-WL or even k-WL on graphs cannot? For instance, hypergraph configurations or simplicial complexes where upper vs. lower adjacencies are crucial.

6. Relations to sheaf/CW networks: How does k-CCWL/TCk+2 apply to CW networks (Bodnar et al., 2021) and cellular sheaf-based models? Are there natural adaptations of the atomic type to encode sheaf morphisms/twists, and would the pairwise counting extend?

7. Limits and blind spots: Are there graph/topological properties you can prove are still not definable in TCk+2 for fixed k (i.e., requiring unbounded k)? A short “limitations” subsection would sharpen the theoretical picture.

8. Anchors and robustness: The broadcast-anchor gadget is central. How robust is this construction to noise or attribute perturbations? If attributes are continuous and then discretized, does the identical-vs-disjoint property survive?
