# Programmable Exploration of Synthesizable Chemical Space

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 2, 6, 4

## Abstract
The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present a programmable model for the discovery of molecules within synthesizable space. The model can generate synthesizable molecules subject to complex logical queries of molecular properties. By leveraging this querying capability, molecular optimization with respect to black-box oracle functions can be performed through iterative refinement of the queries, which achieves high optimization efficiency while preserving synthesizability. We demonstrate the model's high coverage of the synthesizable chemical space, achieving a record-high 92\% reconstruction rate on a chemical space projection test set curated from the Enamine REAL database. We then evaluate its capability for complex query-based molecular design through a series of multi-objective molecular discovery benchmarks. Finally, we show that the query-based molecular optimization technique achieves substantially higher sampling efficiency than both synthesis-based and synthesis-agnostic methods.

### Summary
This paper proposes PrexSyn, a programmable generative model designed to directly explore the synthesizable chemical space.
As input features, it uses descriptors such as ECFP4 fingerprints, molecular weight, ClogP, and TPSA.
In addition, the authors applied a method inspired by logic gates, adopting a product-of-experts formulation.
The model was tested on various benchmarks, including Enamine REAL, ChEMBL, Guacamol, and sEH binding (docking).
They employed an iterative black-box oracle-guided refinement process.

### Strengths
1. They tested the model on a wide range of benchmarks.

2. They also proposed a novel logic gate–inspired approach.

### Weaknesses
1. PrexSyn uses structural descriptors such as ClogP, TPSA, and molecular weight, which are also used as objectives in benchmarks like GuacaMol.
Since these descriptors are explicitly included during model training, there is a risk of label leakage, where the model indirectly learns test-time objectives.
Consequently, the reported oracle efficiency may not accurately reflect generalization to unseen or functional properties beyond the training distribution.

2. The proposed method relies heavily on black-box oracle feedback for query refinement.
This raises questions about the fairness of comparison, as oracle calls during query perturbations may effectively exceed those in baseline methods.
Using oracle functions also consumes significant computational resources, so it seems reasonable to assume that they would incur a higher computational cost compared to methods like Synformer or ReaSyn.

3. The main table includes ReaSyn, but after checking the ReaSyn paper directly, I found that the experiments related to the sEH binding in Table 4 are also included in the Reasyn paper. This is quite puzzling. 

4. The paper claims Logic in its method, but in the end, it’s just a product of probabilities. I don’t think the term “logic” is appropriate in this context.

### Summary
This paper presents PrexSyn, which is a generative framework for designing synthesizable molecules by directly generating synthetic pathways in the form of postfix notation rather than unconstrained molecular graphs. The model uses a decoder-only transformer that takes molecular property prompts as input and autoregressively generates sequences of building blocks and reaction templates from a library of 223,244 purchasable building blocks and 115 reaction templates. To enable complex multi-property molecular design, the authors develop a sampling algorithm that compiles logical queries (using AND, NOT, OR operators) into arithmetic combinations of probability distributions conditioned on individual properties, allowing users to "program" generation objectives. For molecular optimization with respect to black-box oracle functions, the authors introduce a query space optimization approach that iteratively refines property queries based on oracle feedback using genetic algorithms, avoiding direct selection from the vast building block action space.

### Strengths
1. The authors employ postfix notations of synthesis using purchasable building blocks and validated reaction templates, which enhances the practical synthesizability of the generated molecules and provides explicit synthetic pathways rather than relying solely on heuristic synthesizability scores.

2. The authors address multi-objective molecular discovery tasks and incorporate multiple property constraints, which are crucial considerations in practical drug discovery scenarios.

3. The use of logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) is an interesting concept

### Weaknesses
**1. Limited novelty**
- Postfix notation of synthesis representation is directly taken from ChemProjector (Luo et al., 2024)

- Also, the concept of the query-based molecular optimization technique is not novel, as it appears to be similar to and has already been introduced in the existing work by Hoffman et al. (2021), “Optimizing Molecules Using Efficient Queries from Property Evaluations.”

**2. Missing critical baselines and clarifications**
- There is no comparison with recent strong baselines such as ReaSyn (2025) on the sEH binding task (Table 4). While the authors include ReaSyn in the main results table, it is unclear whether its exclusion from Table 4 was intentional, given that the proposed framework appears to underperform against ReaSyn on this specific task.

- Moreover, the detailed explanation of the differences between PrexSyn (Last) and PrexSyn (Top) remains unclear and somewhat confusing.

- No comparison with graph-based multi-objective optimization methods that could provide synthesizability post-hoc

**3. Insufficient ablation studies**
- No ablation on the choice of structural properties used during training (why these specific properties?)

- No detailed analysis on the impact of different query coefficients (beyond a brief mention in Appendix B.4)

- The choice of the genetic algorithm for query space optimization is not well justified, and no comparison with other optimization strategies is provided.

**4. Scalability concerns**
- The vocabulary size of over 223K tokens can be quite large for a molecular discovery framework; however, no analysis of the associated memory or computational requirements is provided.

- There is no discussion of how the proposed method would scale to substantially larger building block libraries, which is important given that real chemical spaces may contain billions of possible molecules.

**5. Insufficient discussion**
- There is no analysis of which types of property combinations are difficult for the model due to potential property conflicts, nor an explanation of why these difficulties arise.

- There is no discussion of when the query-based generation fails or produces low-quality molecules

### Questions
1. The paper’s core component relies on the structure–function principle, and the authors train the model solely on structural properties (e.g., ECFP4, scaffolds, descriptors) but expect it to generalize to functional properties at inference time without providing validation of this capability. However, many crucial drug properties exhibit complex structure–function relationships that may not be well captured by simple fingerprints, raising concerns about how such generalization can be achieved.

2. I also wonder whether the model suffers from mode collapse when optimizing for specific properties

### Summary
This work proposes PrexSyn: a transformer-based model for property-conditioned synthesizable molecule generation. It works by decoding a synthesis tree description based on a property query prompt. The authors then evaluate this on several benchmarks and show promising results.

### Strengths
**(S1)**: Synthesizable molecule optimization is a practical and important topic in ML-assisted drug discovery. Experiments are relatively broad and show generally promising trends.

**(S2)**: The handling of AND property constraints by combining next-token probability distributions stemming from separate decoding rollouts for each constituent property is an interesting setup, which nicely sidesteps the need to train under varying numbers of AND-connected properties. It looks like a neat and novel trick to me, although it is possible that it has already appeared in prior work that I am not aware of.

**(S3)**: The paper is well-written and mostly clear (apart from things mentioned in **(W1)** below).

### Weaknesses
**(W1)**: A few aspects of the work are so far not fully clear to me:

- **(W1a)**: The authors mention the ECFP4 fingerprint is a supported molecular property, which would make it a vector-valued property (with the exact length depending on how it's folded). The example in Figure 1c shows a function `ECFP` with a binary string argument, while examples in Table 2 a function `ECFP4` with a SMILES as argument (both suggesting a scalar-valued property of fingerprint _similarity_ rather than fingerprint itself). Am I correct to assume the fingerprint is always a scalar-valued property of fingerprint similarity to some vector, and that vector can be derived as a fingerprint of some given seed molecule, although that can also change later during mutation?

- **(W1b)**: When generating the postfix notation of synthesis, can the model pick any forward reaction template, as long as it matches the reactants (i.e. masking out inapplicable reactions), or is there any validation of applicability, e.g. through a forward reaction model? Template match alone doesn't guarantee the reaction would actually make sense (and in fact it's a somewhat weak signal, because in the forward direction, given reactants, one could say usually a single reaction can only happen, so if two templates match, one of them likely does not occur in real life). Also, what happens if template application produces more than one result (stemming from the template matching in multiple places due to symmetries, e.g. see Figure 2 in [1])? These questions would largely also apply to SynFlowNet, but I'm equally unsure if they are addressed there (please correct me if they are).

- **(W1c)**: Is there any explanation behind the optimization results in Figure 3 being the same up to ~1k steps, and then the conditioned approach rapidly outperforming? It's a minor point, but some intuition behind this would be great.

**(W2)**: The scaffold-based tasks use soft scaffold presence scoring, which is a practical approach to make the optimization tractable, but in real-world drug discovery one would often prefer an exact match of the scaffold (and optimize properties under that constraint). It's fine to optimize the soft constraint, but it would be great to see the results then evaluated under the strict match requirement; I wonder if PrexSyn's optimization is flexible enough to find solutions which match the scaffold exactly. One point of comparison would be the scaffold-based Guacamol-style tasks from the MoLeR paper [2].

**Nitpicks**

- "oracle function is defined as the negative docking score predicted by a proxy models" - shouldn't this be "proxy model" (singular)?

### Summary
This paper presents a decoder only transformer model (PrexSyn) for generating products from a combinatorial search space according to a postfix notation of synthetic pathways based on user specified molecular property queries. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate PrexSyn's ability to perform tasks such as retrieving analogues from the Enamine REAL library, sample compounds subject to logical conditions on property values, and optimize black box property objectives by iteratively refining query embeddings.

### Strengths
This paper is well motivated by a need for better computational tools to generate compounds out of structured, synthesizeable chemical spaces that satisfy a set of user-specified requirements, such as drug-likeness. Many of the existing generative models or RL approaches that have been proposed for this problem do not handle the programmable aspect that this paper has focused on, and therefore would require separate models for different constraints. So the ability to handle such user specified requirements without retraining is certainly a strength of this paper. While there exists recent prior work on utilizing decoder only transformer models with molecular properties as prompts towards building programmable generative models, the authors focus on using a postfix notation for constructing products out of combinatorial chemical spaces is original and has practical utility. The approach to combining the predictions compositionally for a set of logical conditions appears unique and interesting.

### Weaknesses
I feel that the paper’s main weaknesses lie in its lack of novelty (the model mainly recombines established ideas like product-of-experts conditioning, postfix synthesis representations, and transformer-based conditional generation) and limited empirical validation of the idea's merit. Although I found the exposition interesting, the proposed logical query composition relies on strong (and not realistic) independence assumptions. The synthesizability guarantees are also limited to syntactic feasibility with respect to the postfix notation (which induces a valid SMILES), not necessarily practical synthesis, so the claims around synthesizability are perhaps a bit overzealous. I also found the claims relating to functional generalization to not be convincingly demonstrated, since all the downstream tasks in question are related to docking (i.e., structural, not functional). The experimental evaluations invite questions around the design and key experiments such as those summarized in Table 2 are lacking a baseline for comparison, so the quality of the reported performance is unclear.

### Questions
Can you expand on the training setup? How are prompts sampled / constructed during training? It isn't clear to me whether all of the properties are being passed as input to the prompt or a subset of them, how the threshold values are chosen (since prompts like "MOL_WT < 500" can be supplied, that suggests that inequalities were used in the prompts during training), etc. How are the more complex prompts like ECFP, FeatureSim, and ScaffoldSim utilized in training vs. inference? I.e., can a user specify a prompt on ECFP based similarity to a query SMILES that was not utilized during training (or to a scaffold), or do these need to be pre-selected at training time? 

Table 1 reports results of different recent algorithms on the chemical space projection task, along with the proposed PrexSyn. However it would be helpful to compare against traditional ECFP-based analog retrieval, which are established in the industry for identifying structurally similar compounds to a query molecule out of a large library of compounds. It would be instructive to know, as a baseline, how would traditional analog retrieval perform on these reconstruction tasks relative to PrexSyn? I ask because the reconstruction rates for the baselines considered in the paper are very low on Enamine REAL in contrast to what would be expected from an analog retrieval.

In Table 2, the results are reported in terms of the average of the percentage of constraints satisfied correctly. In many contexts, violation of even a single constraint can be unsatisfactory. It would be helpful to also report on the percent of compounds that satisfy all constraints (i.e., where even a single constraint violation deems a compound as negative).
