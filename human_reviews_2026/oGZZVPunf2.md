# HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 6

## Abstract
Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.

### Summary
The authors propose HybridLinker, a framework for molecular linker generation that integrates both topological diversity and geometric validity. The method performs two-phase generation by combining point cloud–free and point cloud–aware inference through the proposed LinkerDPS mechanism.

### Strengths
* The motivation and illustration of tasks and methods are clear.
* The paper presents thorough experimental results and efficiency analyses.
* The related work is well covered, and the core idea of LinkerDPS is explained clearly.

### Weaknesses
* Generating 3D geometric structures based on an initially generated 2D topology is already a known strategy in molecular modeling, which limits the novelty of the proposed framework.
* The metric definitions are somewhat misleading. Typically, Uniqueness refers to the ratio of unique molecules among the valid ones. However, the paper defines Uniqueness and V+U differently—computing the unique ratio over all generated molecules—which may invalidate the claimed diversity–validity trade-off between PC-free and PC-aware models as shown in Table 1.
* The reported performance numbers for existing baselines appear inconsistent with those in the original papers, which raises questions about reproducibility and fairness of comparison.

### Questions
* Please clarify the metric definitions and computation details (especially for Uniqueness and V+U).
* Explain how the baseline numbers were derived or reproduced. If the derivation and comparison are clearly explained and verified, I would consider increasing my overall score.
* Minor: correct typographical errors such as “straghtforward” in Appendix F.

### Summary
The paper introduces HybridLinker, a fragment-linking methodology that combines a point-cloud-free model, which proposes bonding topologies for linkers connecting two molecular fragments of interest, with a point-cloud-aware diffusion model that places the coordinates for the linker atoms in 3D space. The approach tries to balance enhancing the diversity of point-cloud-aware methods and improving the validity of point-cloud-free methods. The authors evaluate HybridLinker on fragmented molecules from the ZINC-250k dataset, using rdkit for structure generation and fragmentation.

### Strengths
The paper discusses a tension between point-cloud-free and point-cloud-aware models for small-molecule linker generation, and proposes a hybrid framework to address it. The presentation of the method is clear, and the topic addresses an important challenge in fragment-based drug discovery. The motivation for the work is clear and it connects directly to practical workflows that could leverage existing components.

### Weaknesses
Although the background is mostly clear, the introduction does not explain why Nref is given and does not discuss cases where this value (or even Rcond) are not specified precisely but might cover a range. The empirical evaluation of this work lacks full transparency on the data splits and the methodological details, and there are no codes provided for reproduction of the results.  A key ambiguity concerns the exact identity of the test set of the 400 fragment-linker pairs out of the 250k molecules from ZINC; because the phrasing "aligning with the test set used in DeLinker" is ambiguous, we cannot take for granted that the scores of different methods in the tables are directly comparable. Furthermore, the limited generality of using rdkit-generated conformers from a starting set of 250k molecules and using openbabel for bond inference also suggests that the result might not generalize to harder or more realistic cases of interest, like pocket-conditioned geometries with unknown ability to connect the fragments. Similarly, the interpretation of high logP as desirable is problematic as typically high logP implies poor preclinical properties and is typically desired to be within a range (the rule of 5 considered logP higher than 5 as problematic.  Finally, it is not clear if the practical timescales involved in running these codes make few percent changes in diversity or uniqueness as important as the authors and past benchmarks make them sound, especially if single-stage methods could have faster throughput to compensate for reduced metrics.

### Questions
How exactly were the 400 test pairs selected and what is the 3D and 2D structural overlap of the linkers compared to those in the training set?  How variable is the performance by picking different sets of 400, or finding the hardest possible set?

What would be a better, harder benchmark for fragment linking methods?  Different usecases require different considerations (protac design vs fragment-linking in a pocket).  Oftentimes, specific fragments cannot be connected in a pocket without substantial loss in potency. Have the authors considered curating their own dataset for pushing the limits of methods in the future?

### Summary
This paper addresses the long-standing tension in fragment-based drug design between sampling diverse linkers and producing valid 3D molecules. It distinguishes point cloud-free models that maximize topological diversity but often violate spatial constraints from point cloud-aware models that respect 3D fragment poses at the cost of exploration. The proposed HybridLinker combines these worlds without retraining: a point cloud-free generator proposes diverse bonding topologies, and a diffusion-based point cloud-aware model performs topology-guided posterior sampling via LinkerDPS, an energy-inspired cross-domain likelihood that ties molecular topology to 3D point clouds. On ZINC fragment–linker pairs, the method reports concurrent gains in validity and diversity metrics and improved rates in a drug-likeness optimization task, positioning the approach as a practical inference-time recipe rather than a new model to train.

### Strengths
The work’s main strength is conceptual clarity around the diversity–validity trade-off and a fair framing of where existing families succeed and fail. The generation-time hybridization is simple, modular, and persuasive: the paper explains, with figures and equations, how a high-entropy surrogate topology can be refined by a validity-focused prior, and it formalizes this with LinkerDPS as a posterior over conformations that is tractable to sample with the pretrained score network. Results back the claim. Compared to DeLinker, FFLOM, 3DLinker, and DiffLinker, HybridLinker improves “diversity with validity” across V+U, V+N, V+HD, V+FG, and V+BM, while keeping validity competitive or higher, which is exactly the property drug discovery practitioners want when exploring linkers. The application-level evaluation is also compelling: the percentage of fragment pairs where generated molecules beat a reference on QED, SA, and PLogP rises for both FFLOM- and DeLinker-based hybrids. Altogether, the paper reads as a clean, training-free principle with tangible gains, and it plausibly generalizes to other inverse problems on 3D molecular point clouds.

### Weaknesses
The weaknesses stem from reliance and scope. The approach inherits capabilities and biases from both the surrogate topology model and the diffusion prior; its success will vary with those choices, and the paper’s experiments are limited to ZINC-derived benchmarks, leaving questions about transfer to protein-contexted tasks like PROTACs or strictly pocket-aware objectives. The cross-domain likelihood that powers LinkerDPS uses a simple bond-length energy and assumes conditional independence between atom identities, bonds, and coordinates given the target variables; these modeling choices may under-penalize geometric pathologies or chemically implausible bonding patterns, and it would help to compare alternative physics- or learned-energy terms. Practical dependencies such as RDKit conformer generation and Open Babel bond inference introduce additional error surfaces that the posterior must absorb, and sensitivity analyses are mostly deferred to appendices rather than made central to the narrative. Finally, while inference-time composition is attractive, the main text gives limited visibility into runtime and cost trade-offs that matter in large sampling campaigns.    



---

Here are itemizing for discussion:

1. Dependence on the chosen surrogate topology model and diffusion prior, inheriting their biases and limits
2. Evaluation scope confined to ZINC-style benchmarks, with no protein-aware or PROTAC-like tasks to test transfer
3. Simplified cross-domain likelihood and independence assumptions that may under-penalize geometric or chemical pathologies
4. Reliance on cheminformatics heuristics with limited sensitivity analyses surfaced in the main text
5. Runtime and compute cost trade-offs not fully characterized for large-scale sampling campaigns

### Questions
please see the weaknesses section.

---

Overall, this is a timely and useful contribution: it demonstrates that careful posterior sampling can reconcile diversity and validity in linker generation, requires no new training, and yields measurable downstream benefits. With broader datasets, deeper ablations on the surrogate-quality and guidance terms, and stronger protein-aware tests, HybridLinker could become a practical default for fragment linking pipelines and a template for cross-domain DPS in molecular modeling.
