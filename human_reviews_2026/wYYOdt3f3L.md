# COUNTERFACTUAL PREDICTION WITH CROSS-WORLD DEPENDENCE

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 2, 6, 2, 2

## Abstract
We study the problem of estimating the expected counterfactual outcome for an individual with covariates $x$ and observed outcome $y$, defined as   $\mu(x,y) = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) \mid X = x, Y(0) = y]$, and constructing valid prediction intervals under the Neyman–Rubin superpopulation model with i.i.d. units. This quantity is generally unidentified without additional assumptions. To link the observed and unobserved potential outcomes, we work with a cross-world correlation function $\rho(x) = \operatorname{cor}(Y(1), Y(0) \mid X = x)$ that quantifies their dependence given the covariates. Plausible bounds on $\rho(x)$, often informed by domain knowledge, enable a principled approach to this otherwise unidentified problem. Given $\rho$, we develop a consistent estimator $\hat\mu_{\rho}(x,y)$ and prediction intervals $C_{\rho}(x,y)$ that satisfy $P[Y(1) \in C_{\rho}(X,Y(0))] \geq 1 - \alpha$ under standard causal assumptions. Almost all existing methods correspond to either the case $\rho = 0$ (ignoring the factual outcome), or $\rho = 1$ (constant treatment effects). We show that interpolating between these cases via cross-world dependence yields estimators that are theoretically optimal under (asymptotic) Gaussian assumptions. In practice, this leads to substantial empirical improvements across a wide range of scenarios.

### Summary
The paper introduces estimators that leverage cross-world dependency for a new causal quantity. The estimators include a point estimate and a prediction interval estimate. Some numerical evaluation results were shown about the proposed estimator.

### Strengths
The cross-world assumption is very interesting. Traditionally, the field of causal inference has treated Y(1) and Y(0) as two quantities that are "opposing" and "if one then not the other". The cross-world dependency assumption allows the identification of a new causal quantity that the paper studies, which was not accessible previously. This causal quantity is potentially of interest in many practical settings and might give rise to further theoretical interest in the community.

The paper seems to be among the first in this line of literature to tackle the above-mentioned problem.

The proposed methodology is simple, and the authors made substantial efforts to motivate the proposed methodology.

### Weaknesses
Assumption: Despite its novelty, I find the cross-world assumption to be very restrictive. Even though the author argued that in many real-world domains, experts may have some knowledge about $\rho(x)$, I believe it is unlikely that they can quantitatively trace out this function. Since this assumption is the central assumption of the paper, without proper justification, the contribution of this paper could be significantly undermined. 

PS: I would suspect that this assumption must be verified in different applied domains: (1) whether or not domain experts can accurately identify $\rho(x)$, and (2) if the estimator's performance turns out to be superior.

Structure: The paper does not seem to have a part dedicated to describing related works in studying cross-world dependency. This part seems to be melded with the "preliminary" section, which could be confusing.

Notation inconsistency: In Definition 1, $\rho$ does not seem to be formally defined---does it represent the marginal version of $\rho(x)$?

Weak theories: It seems like there are no formal theoretical analyses of the properties of the proposed estimator. Additionally, the role of Theorem 1 "motivating" for Definition 1 seems vague to me.

Confusing experiment results: Some experiment results are counterintuitive. In Figure 2 "real data", why do some $\mu_\rho$ with misspecified $\rho$ perform even better than those with correctly specified $\rho$? For example, at IHDP $d = 1$ $\rho = 1$. The experiment results are not explained and analyzed.

### Questions
I would prefer hearing responses for the weaknesses identified above. Additionally:

Introduction part 1: Line 52, I am confused by the argument "this omission can lead to biased counterfactual predictions". To my knowledge, many estimators for CATE are consistent, so I am unsure what "biased" here refers to. Could the authors provide a simple math example?

Introduction part 2: Line 55 " Incorporating the factual outcome alongside the covariates can therefore refine individual-level predictions and improve the accuracy of estimated counterfactuals", this makes sense, but I did not find theorems in the paper supporting this argument. Could the authors elaborate on whether this theoretical result exists and/or where it is proved?

The authors should elaborate more on interpreting why Theorem 1 motivates Definition 1.

Could the authors also elaborate on why, even with a misspecified $\rho$, the proposed estimator outperforms other baselines?

### Summary
This paper tackles the counterfactual prediction problem by making explicit a cross-world correlation parameter $\rho(x)$ to interpolate between ignoring the factual outcome ($\rho = 0$) and perfect dependence ($\rho = 1$). The authors propose a framework for point estimation and prediction intervals for counterfactual outcomes under a prespecified $\rho(x)$, deriving optimality under Gaussian assumptions, and extensive empirical evidence across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an explicit model for the cross-world correlation ($\rho$), a factor largely overlooked in prior literature, and leverages it to develop novel methods for both point and interval estimation of counterfactual outcomes.
2. The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, spanning synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. The proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines across these settings.
3. The authors conduct a thorough investigation into the model's robustness, including sensitivity to the misspecification of $\rho$ and performance in non-Gaussian settings, which strengthens the paper's empirical claims.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method's performance is highly dependent on the pre-specified correlation parameter $\rho(x)$, which requires prior knowledge that is often unavailable in practice. As Figure 3 demonstrates, performance degrades substantially under misspecification of $\rho$.
2. The theoretical guarantees for optimality are derived under a Gaussian assumption, which may not hold in many real-world applications and thus could limit the method's applicability. While empirical results suggest robustness in some non-Gaussian settings, these observations lack rigorous theoretical backing.
3. Key details regarding the conformal prediction methodology are relegated to the appendix. This makes it difficult for readers to fully grasp the approach for constructing prediction intervals without consulting supplementary material.
4. The authors state that most baselines implicitly assume $\rho=0$ or $\rho=1$. While Figure 2 shows the impact of a randomly misspecified $\rho$, the paper would be strengthened by reporting the performance of the proposed method when $\rho$ is fixed to 0 and 1. This would serve as an ablation study, helping to disentangle the performance gains attributable to the core modeling framework from the gains of using a well-specified $\rho$. Such an analysis would provide a fairer comparison to baselines and more decisively highlight the importance of the correlation parameter itself.

### Questions
1. Is there any theoretical guarantee that the optimality results of Theorem 1 can be generalized to non-Gaussian distributions?
2. The choice of $\rho=0.5$ for the Twins dataset requires clarification. While the ground-truth $\rho$ can be controlled in synthetic/semi-synthetic settings (e.g., Synthetic, IHDP), it is unknown for real-world datasets like Twins. Could the authors please clarify the rationale behind selecting $\rho=0.5$? Is this an assumption, or is it motivated by specific domain knowledge about this dataset?

### Summary
This paper considers predicting counterfactual outcomes $E[Y(1) | X = x, Y(0) = y]$ by conditioning on both covariates and the untreated potential outcome. In general, since this quantity depends on the joint distribution (Y(0), Y(1)), it is not identified. So the paper's key contribution is to make explicit the role of "cross-world" correlation --- that is, specific a bound on $\rho(x) = Corr(Y(0), Y(1) \mid X = x)$. The paper proposes point estimators and prediction intervals for this quantity (see their discussion in Section 3 for further details). The authors show that under Gaussianity and other idealized conditions, the prediction intervals are optimal and their point estimators minimize MSE (Theorem 1). The authors illustrate their methods in experiments on synthetic datasets and two classic causal inference datasets.

### Strengths
The paper's two key ideas are potentially nice contributions. I see these two ideas as: (1) focusing on prediction intervals that condition on the factual outcome; and (2) introduce cross-world restrictions using the interpretable parameter $\rho(x)$ (as opposed to other rank invariance or copula based assumptions). 

On (1): to my knowledge, this is the first work to systematically study prediction intervals of this form. Most counterfactual uncertainty quantification conditions only on $X$. Conditioning on the factual outcome Y(0) is conceptually natural—after observing that a patient remained healthy under control, we should tighten our uncertainty about their treated outcome.
On (2): formulating cross-world restrictions in terms of $\rho(x)$ is also natural and simple. It invites domain expertise as researchers might be able to reason about the choice of $\rho$ and lends itself naturally to sensitivity analyses.

### Weaknesses
I found that this paper overclaims what its theoretical contributions actually deliver. 

a) The paper prominently frames its contribution around conditional coverage: that is, $\mathbb{P}(Y(1) \in C_\rho(x,y) \mid X = x, Y(0) = y) \geq 1 - \alpha$. However, as Barber et al. (2020)---which the authors themselves cite---establishes, conditional coverage is generally impossible in finite samples without very strong assumptions. Moreover: (i) the experiments rely on CQR, which only delivers marginal coverage; (ii) their own theoretical analysis shows that their interval inherits conditional validity if the baseline has it --- but CQR does not have it. So why lead with a conditional guarantee that cannot be satisfied in practice? The paper should be reframed entirely around marginal coverage guarantees, which are actually achievable (or suitable modifications of conditional coverage in the spirit of Gibbs et al. 2023). The current presentation misleads readers about what the method delivers.

b) Theorem 1 claims the $C_\rho$ intervals are "optimal" (smallest valid sets) and $\hat{\mu}_\rho$ minimizes MSE. However, this holds only under a ``perfect asymptotic scenario'' requiring: (i) Gaussianity; (ii) Oracle nuisances; (iii) conditionally valid baselines. It is not clear when this result would be relevant. (i) is unrealistic; (ii) does not apply in finite samples where estimation errors matter; and (iii) cannot generally be satisfied. More broadly, the paper does not provide an actual finite sample coverage theorem, which is the standard for conformal inference papers. 

c) The paper claims early on that "Given $\rho$, we develop a consistent estimator and valid prediction intervals." As written, this suggests that specifying only the correlation (plus the marginals) is sufficient to identify $\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \mid X=x, Y(0)=y]$. This is not true in general since specifying only $\rho(x)$ does not pin down the full joint distribution of $(Y(0), Y(1)) \mid X=x$. Without additional assumptions (e.g., Gaussianity), the conditional mean $\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \mid X=x, Y(0)=y]$ is at best partially identified ---multiple joint distributions can share the same marginals and correlation but differ in their conditional expectations. But the paper is written as if this is more general. Furthermore, I don't see how the authors address the validity of the intervals if this quantity is partially identified.  

d) The correlation $\rho(x)$ is also unidentifiable. But the paper provides very little guidance on how it could be reasonably chosen in practice. This is always the central challenge in sensitivity analysis frameworks -- is there a strategy for which this can be empirically calibrated? How might we elicit this information from practitioners? The paper would greatly benefit from expending more effort on how $\rho(x)$ might calibrated or elicited. The structural model was nice, but it only justifies $\rho \geq 0$.

### Summary
The paper tackles individual counterfactual prediction under cross-world dependence: i.e., conditional correlation between potential outcomes. They propose a consistent point estimator and intervals with nominal coverage. They argue that most existing approaches correspond to the extremes $\rho=0$ (ignore the factual outcome) or $\rho=1$ (constant effects), while their method interpolates between these and is theoretically optimal. 	I find the approach promising, although I am not persuaded that the “cross-world dependence” assumption adds clear value beyond existing methods, and have several questions.

### Strengths
- Makes the cross-world link explicit, and introduces not only a consistent estimator but also prediction intervals.
- Creates a clear knob for sensitivity analysis and a place to inject domain knowledge.
- Unifies existing approaches and supplies theoretical guarantees (consistency/optimality under stated conditions) .
- Compatible with off-the-shelf single-world predictors.

### Weaknesses
1. My primary hesitation is that the paper does not yet motivate or position itself clearly relative to recent advances in counterfactual prediction, which the current manuscript is entirely ignoring. In particular, there is a growing line of work that estimates counterfactual outcomes (or closely related conditional effects) under the potential–outcome framework, including:
- Kim, K., Kennedy, E., & Zubizarreta, J. (2022). Doubly robust counterfactual classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 34831-34845.
- McClean, A., Branson, Z., & Kennedy, E. H. (2024). Nonparametric estimation of conditional incremental effects. Journal of Causal Inference, 12(1), 20230024.
- Kim, K. (2025). Semiparametric Counterfactual Regression. arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.02694. 
Importantly, these methods provide semiparametric efficiency (or efficiency-competitive rates) for their estimation/inferential procedures under weaker nonparametric conditions and also offer principled ways to interpolate potential outcomes via stochastic interventions.  I understand your target causal effects are different from those, but the paper needs to articulate when and why this particular alternative is preferable in practice.

2. The contribution hinges on the correlation between potential outcomes, which cannot be learned from observed data. Without a credible way to estimate or even bound the dependence between the two potential outcomes, the method just reduces to a sensitivity analysis rather than a learnable model. Any misspecification of this dependence directly translates into bias and miscalibrated uncertainty estimates, undermining the main inferential claims. Moreover, in my opinion, the assumption itself is difficult to justify or verify in realistic applications;  I believe domain experts rarely have concrete knowledge about cross-world dependence. Without stronger theoretical or empirical grounding for this assumption, the practical reliability and interpretability of the proposed framework remain limited.

3. The theoretical results rely on Gaussian behavior and near-oracle predictors, and are clean only in special cases (e.g., independence or perfect correlation). In the realistic middle regime, broad identification and coverage guarantees are missing.

4. The setup predicts an unobserved outcome using the observed outcome for the same unit—useful after the fact, but not for targeting or policy choices made beforehand. I don’t see clear descriptive or prescriptive benefits for decision makers.
