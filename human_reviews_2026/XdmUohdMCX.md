## Abstract
Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, as it requires both perceiving road elements and understanding how lanes connect to each other (L2L) and to traffic elements (L2T). Existing methods often focus on either perception or L2L reasoning, leaving L2T underexplored and fall short of jointly optimizing perception and reasoning. Moreover, although topology prediction inherently involves relations, relational modeling itself is seldom incorporated into feature extraction or supervision. As humans naturally leverage contextual relationships to recognize road element and infer their connectivity, we posit that relational modeling can likewise benefit both perception and reasoning, and that these two tasks should be mutually enhancing. To this end, we propose RelTopo, a multi-level relational modeling approach that systematically integrates relational cues across three levels: **1) perception-level:** a relation-aware lane detector with geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention enriches lane representations;  **2) reasoning-level:** relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, enhance topology inference via relational cues; and **3) supervision-level:** a contrastive InfoNCE strategy regularizes relational embeddings. This design enables perception and reasoning to be optimized jointly. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that RelTopo significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning, with gains of +3.1 in $\text{DET} _ l$, +5.3 in $\text{TOP} _ {ll}$, +4.9 in $\text{TOP} _ {lt}$, and +4.4 overall in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

### Summary
This paper proposes a multi-level relational modeling framework for the topology reasoning task of autonomous driving, following the paradigm of the two-branch architecture for image-based and BEV-based modeling.
RelTopo is constructed with a three-layer architecture:
Relational Perception Layer: Using Geometry-Biased Self-Attention and Curve-Guided Cross-Attention;
Relational Reasoning Layer: Designing Geometry-Enhanced L2L Reasoning Head and Cross-View L2T Reasoning Head;
Relational Supervision Layer: Introducing Contrastive InfoNCE Loss.
Experimental results demonstrate that RelTopo significantly outperforms all previous methods on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results in both lane detection and topology reasoning.

### Strengths
1. The designs of all components targeting the perception and relational modeling are reasonable and insightful. The authors design a more effective cross-attention mechanism to aggregate point features and update the query feature, thereby capturing reasonable dependency relationships.
2. Explicit geometrical similarities such as angle similarities and distance embeddings are considered into the feature learning, which can leverage better and full supervision for the model.

### Weaknesses
1. Many individual novel parts are proposed to solve each sub-problem of the topology prediction task, but the whole work is just combining all of them to achieve better performance; this is still not stepping out of the framework like TopoNet or LaneSegNet, such as using BEV-feature for lane-to-lane connectivity and BEV-FV feature for Lane2traffic connectivity. And finally, similar approaches of using MLPs to predict the relation matrix are not novel. 
2. The inner contributions of L2L (Learning-to-Learn) reasoning and L2T (Learning-to-Teach) indeed share a philosophical alignment with other works like TopoLogic, particularly in how "pull" and "push" losses between instances.
3. The L2T head relies on projecting 3D lane lines onto the 2D image plane. This projection can produce significant errors in scenes with significant elevation changes (e.g., steep slopes). How robust is your approach in such challenging scenarios?

### Questions
1.The geometric biased self-attention module uses both distance and angle as biases. What is the relative contribution of these two geometric priors? Are there any relevant ablation experiments?
2. The Geometry-biased self-attention and curve-guided cross-attention cues are directly introduced into geometric relational. Will this bring about a relatively large computational overhead? Is there an efficient experiment?
3.GE in eq.2 is not specified.

### Summary
This paper proposes two novel mechanisms, namely Geometry-Biased Self-Attention and Path-Guided Cross-Attention, to improve lane perception. Additionally, the authors introduce a Geometry-Enhanced Module for enhancing lane reasoning and an X-View Module to improve lane-traffic interaction reasoning. The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in topology reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on the OpenLane-V2 dataset showcase its state-of-the-art performance, further validating the effectiveness of the approach.

### Strengths
- The authors employ Geometry-Biased Self-Attention to improve lane perception and introduce a Geometry-Enhanced Module to enhance lane topology reasoning. The proposed approach performs effectively in both tasks.
- The experiments in this paper demonstrate superior performance in lane detection, L2L reasoning, and L2T reasoning on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, compared to previous methods, with improvements observed in each of these tasks individually.

### Weaknesses
- This paper lacks of clear motivation,  which I think is very indispensable.
- This paper lacks experimental justification for the choice of Bezier curves for modeling and does not provide an explanation for why the Curve-Guided Cross-Attention mechanism is effective.
- This paper does not explain the connection between proposed modules, such as geometry-biased SA and curve-guided CA.

### Questions
- In Table 1, why the TOP_ll score of RoadPainter is 7.9, which is lower than other compared methods? 
- Could the author report model size and inference speed? It would be helpful to compare the number of parameters and inference latency of RelTopo with prior methods such as TopoMLP and TopoLogic, to better understand the trade-offs.
- In Table 2, could the author explain why the results of DET_l, DET_t, and TOP_ll are constantly fluctuating?

### Summary
This paper introduces RelTopo, a unified framework for road topology reasoning in autonomous driving that jointly optimizes perception and reasoning through multi-level relational modeling. Unlike prior methods that treat lane detection (perception) and connectivity reasoning (L2L, L2T) as separate stages, RelTopo systematically embeds relational cues at three levels:

Perception level: A relation-aware lane detector uses geometry-biased self-attention and curve-guided cross-attention to encode inter-lane relationships and improve lane feature representation.

Reasoning level: Relation-enhanced topology heads—one for lane-to-lane (L2L) and one for lane-to-traffic (L2T)—integrate geometric and cross-view alignment cues to infer connectivity more robustly.

Supervision level: A contrastive InfoNCE loss regularizes relational embeddings, pulling connected pairs closer in the latent space.

Experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark show RelTopo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both detection and topology metrics (e.g., +4.4 OLS overall). The approach demonstrates that explicit relational modeling strengthens both perception and reasoning, providing a new foundation for holistic driving scene understanding.

### Strengths
1. The idea of the proposed Cross-View L2T head is interesting and provides valuable insights for future research.

2. The authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark and present a comprehensive ablation study.

3. The paper includes extensive visualizations of experimental results, which greatly help readers in analyzing and understanding the method’s effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. What is the difference between the proposed Geometry-Biased Self-Attention and the Geometric-Guided Self-Attention used in TopoFormer (CVPR 2025)?

2. In Section 1 (Introduction), the authors state that existing works suffer from fragmented task optimization, arguing that methods such as TopoMLP (ICLR 2024) fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning modules. However, in the current design of RelTopo, the Perception Level and Reasoning Level are also implemented separately, and the loss functions for L2L and L2T remain independent. The authors need to further clarify how RelTopo achieves joint optimization of perception and reasoning.

3. The authors should compare the impact of Geometry-Biased Self-Attention and GDT (Geometric Distance Topology) from TopoLogic on training and inference time. While I agree with the authors that GDT acts as a post-processing correction method, it may still offer significant advantages in inference efficiency. I hope the authors can discuss this aspect in detail.

### Questions
1. As mentioned in point 2 of the Weaknesses section, I do not believe the proposed method truly achieves joint optimization. I hope the authors can provide further clarification on this point, as I think it is crucial to the paper’s evaluation.

2. I believe the authors’ perception-level, reasoning-level, and supervision-level actually represent three different optimization perspectives, rather than hierarchical levels. Therefore, the term “multi-level” may not be entirely appropriate, and I would like to hear the authors’ discussion or justification on this aspect.
