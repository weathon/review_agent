# Agent-Environment Alignment via Automated Interface Generation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks.
These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as **agent-environment misalignment**. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose **ALIGN**, an \underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface \underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface.
Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, achieve consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile, ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures and LLM backbones without interface regeneration.

### Summary
This paper proposes ALIGN, an automated interface generation framework to mitigate the agent-environment misalignment, a key bottleneck to agent performance. ALIGN has two components: *InferRule* (automatically generated static rules) and *WrapStep* (step-wise observation augmentation with feedback). A failure-driven analyzer and optimizer loop learns interfaces and evaluates agents in the wrapped environments. The reported results show improvements across three domains against baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper points out the agent-environment misalignment as a key bottleneck for agent performance.
2. The implementation is straightforward and does not need to change the code of agent or environment, only adding the interface layer.

### Weaknesses
1. The interface construction is demonstrated only in three domains as provided in Appendix, but does not discuss a unified design space for interface representation, limiting generalization beyond tested settings.
2. Only donwstream success rate and proportion ofconsecutive invalid actions are reported for measuring effectiveness. However, it is unclear whether interfaces are learned only on training tasks and then frozen for test. Otherwise, the analyzer and optimizer loop could constitute a test-time adaptation. Moreover, *WrapStep* appears to provide tailored corrective hints which may make the comparisons unfair.
3. The limitations of the method are not properly mentioned.

### Questions
1. Were interfaces generated only on training tasks and frozen for test? Please specify any test-time adaptation.
2. Can you provide a unified design space for interface representation?
3. Can you add an ablation with limit information provided (interface that avoid tailored corrective hints) to test robustness?
4. What are the limitations of ALIGN and what are common failure cases?

### Summary
The paper introduces ALIGN, an automated interface-generation framework to address Agent–Environment Misalignment (AEM). ALIGN operates as a lightweight wrapper without modifying either the agent or the environment. Across ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, WebShop, and M3ToolEval, it delivers substantial gains for diverse agent paradigms (Vanilla, ReAct, Self-Consistency, Self-Refine, Planning). Interfaces produced in a single pass transfer across different agent algorithms and LLM backbones, and in multiple comparisons outperform manually engineered interfaces.

### Strengths
1. The paper clearly defines the problem and is well motivated, identifying agent–environment misalignment as a key, underexplored bottleneck and substantiating its impact with preliminary evidence, which provides strong motivation for the work.

2. The methodology is novel: unlike manually engineered interfaces, ALIGN automatically detects misalignments and synthesizes interfaces, introducing the notion of an auto-aligned interface (Sec. 3). 

3. The empirical study is substantial, demonstrating consistent gains across four benchmarks and five agent families, and the ablations reasonably verify the contribution of each component.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments are conducted in environments with discrete, text-based action spaces. It is less clear how the ALIGN framework would scale to environments with significantly more complex, high-dimensional, or continuous observation/action spaces; It is less clear how the ALIGN framework would scale to environments with significantly more complex, or continuous observation/action spaces. 

2. The dependence on high-capability models. The Analyzer and Optimizer currently rely on top proprietary LLMs, raising concerns about accessibility and reproducibility. This raises questions about the accessibility of the framework and its performance when using smaller, open-source models for these roles. An experiment or discussion on this aspect would enhance the paper's contribution.

### Questions
I have a few questions and suggestions that I hope will help clarify some aspects of the work and further strengthen the paper.

1. How about the generalization to more complex environments? The experiments are convincingly demonstrated in text-based settings with discrete action spaces. It would be helpful to include a discussion of the framework’s applicability to more complex or continuous observation/action spaces.

2. The success of the Analyzer and Optimizer seems intrinsically linked to the advanced reasoning and coding capabilities of the proprietary models used.Have you explored using smaller or open-source models (e.g., Llama-3.1-70B, Qwen2.5-14B) for the core components of ALIGN? How does the quality of the generated interface degrade when using less capable models? 

3. Comparison with agent fine-tuning methods. The paper frames ALIGN as a training-free approach that modifies the interface rather than the agent. However, an alternative is to use failed trajectories as training data to fine-tune the agent itself (e.g., DPO). A direct experimental comparison against a fine-tuning baseline using the same error signals would help demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper formalizes a problem: the discrepancy between an agent's internal expectations about its actions and the environment’s actual transition dynamics (the agent-environment misalignment problem). This problem significantly reduces the agent's task success rate.

Some recent studies have addressed this issue by manually designing interfaces. However, this approach is very labor-intensive, and its optimality for the agent cannot be guaranteed.

In this paper, the authors propose the ALIGN framework, which automatically generates intermediate interfaces to alleviate this misalignment without modifying the agent's logic or the environment code. The ALIGN framework autonomously analyzes failure trajectories, infers interface rules, verifies these rules through environment interactions, and iteratively optimizes the alignment effect. Experiments on four benchmark sets (ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, WebShop, and M3ToolEval) demonstrate that ALIGN achieves consistent improvements across various LLM agent architectures (e.g., ReAct, Self-Consistency, and Planning).

### Strengths
(1) The work introduces a new problem formulation: agent-environment misalignment, which captures failure modes overlooked by prior works focusing solely on reasoning or reward modeling.

(2) The authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and agent frameworks, providing strong empirical evidence for the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
(1) Figure 1 is difficult to understand and is not well aligned with the examples in lines 100–103 (INFERRULES and WRAPSTEP). In addition, some figures could benefit from clearer captions.

(2) While this paper elucidates the functionality and semantic boundaries of the Interface through descriptive language in several places, it does not provide a formal definition. This limitation hinders a more precise analysis of the agent–environment misalignment problem and a deeper understanding of the ALIGN Framework. The authors are encouraged to provide an explicit definition of the Interface and to conduct a more detailed analysis of the agent–environment misalignment problem from the interface perspective, including a discussion of prior works that exhibit such misalignment.

(3) Although the ablation results are reported, the distinction between INFERRULES and WRAPSTEP in terms of their relative contributions could be made clearer. Providing a per-component breakdown or a visualization of the learned rule structures would further improve interpretability.

### Summary
This paper identifies and tackles the overlooked challenge of agent-environment misalignment in interactive decision-making tasks with LLM-based agents. While most prior work focuses on improving agent reasoning or environment design, this paper pinpoints interface design, the communication layer between the agent and environment, as a bottleneck. The authors propose ALIGN, an automated framework that generates interface wrappers, enriching environment descriptions and step-wise observations to better inform the agent. The paper shows that ALIGN improves performance substantially, generalizes across agents and LLMs, and outperforms manually designed interfaces. It is evaluated on four benchmarks spanning embodied AI, web navigation, and tool-use.

### Strengths
1. This paper identifies a real and underexplored problem of agent-environment misalignment and shows through motivating examples and pilot studies (e.g., "Examine bookshelf"->“Nothing happens” in ALFWorld) that it significantly limits agent performance. 
2. ALIGN introduces a plug-and-play prompting wrapper approach that does not require changing agent logic or environment code.
3. ALIGN is evaluated on 4 benchmarks, 5 agent methods, and multiple LLMs. The performance improvements seem to be large and consistent (e.g., up to +57.46% on ALFWorld).

### Weaknesses
1. Ideal Assumption: The method assumes that environment rules are fully available to agents, which may not always be the case in real-world settings.

2. Potential Unfair Comparison: In the Analyzer Prompt Template for Misalignment Analysis, the Gold Action and Observation Sequence are provided, which is often unavailable. This causes unfair comparison with other baselines that do not have access to them.

3. Potential Unfair Comparison: In the Implementation Detail section, it is mentioned that Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct is used as the base model, while Gemini 2.5 and GPT-4.1 Pro are leveraged as the Optimizer and Analyzer. This also causes unfair comparison with other baselines that only use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

4. Besides, the paper lacks analysis on the detection rate of Agent-Environment Misalignment. Are there different types or causes of such misalignment? If so, could the authors provide a taxonomy?

5. The authors mainly perform evaluation on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4.1. How effective is the proposed method on more advanced LLMs (such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, etc.) and on reasoning LLMs with varying reasoning capabilities?

6. The experiments show the iteration results without verification but lack iteration results with verification, which are also important to fully understand the method’s effectiveness.

7. In addition, cost and time analysis for different iterations and components are not provided.

8. It is also encouraged to report the variance or standard deviation of the main results.
