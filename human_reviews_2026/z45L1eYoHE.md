# Towards Expanding-Node Spatial-Temporal Forecasting: A Structured Node Interaction Prompting Perspective

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 6, 6

## Abstract
The rapid expansion of sensor systems, such as traffic networks, climate monitoring, and energy scheduling, poses new challenges for spatial-temporal series forecasting. While existing models have achieved strong performance under the fixed-node assumption, they rely on node-dependent parameters and fail to adapt when the network evolves, i.e., when old nodes are removed and new nodes with limited history are added. This expanding-node forecasting scenario introduces two critical challenges: (1) learning heterogeneous node representations without coupling learnable parameters to node count, and (2) enabling effective adaptation to new nodes with scarce observations. To tackle these challenges, we propose SNIP (Structured Node Interaction Prompting), a model-agnostic framework that constructs static spatial-temporal priors from historical observations and topology, and dynamically refines them during model training. Specifically, SNIP generates structured priors from three perspectives: periodic patterns across nodes, spatial-temporal interactions under time delays and graph structural information. These priors are projected into model as node promptings and then dynamically refined. For new nodes, SNIP initializes priors by similarity-weighted mixtures of old nodes and updates them with limited history, enabling efficient few-shot adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SNIP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in expanding-node scenarios. Beyond accuracy, SNIP provides plug-and-play generality and computational efficiency, bridging the gap between fixed-node precision and expanding-node adaptability in spatial-temporal forecasting.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of spatial-temporal forecasting with expanding nodes in a flexible and efficient manner. They propose SNIP, a method that constructs structured static priors while refining them with dynamic information. The paper is well-motivated and clearly organized. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with enhanced scalability and reduced retraining costs.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses the challenging problem of expanding-node spatiotemporal forecasting, leveraging priors from historical observations without relying on learnable node embeddings.  
2. The proposed method decouples prior information into static and dynamic components, adapting the dynamic prior to the expansion stage in a model-agnostic manner.  
3.  The paper is well-structured and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The method is presented as model-agnostic but is evaluated on limited STF architectures. Validation on diverse backbones (e.g., graph-, attention-, and convolution-based) is needed to support this claim.  
2.  The current datasets involve relatively small node scales and fixed four-stage splits. To better assess scalability and adaptability, experiments should include larger and more dynamic streams, such as _Air-Stream_ with thousands of nodes and _PEMS-Stream_ with multiple expansion phases (655 → 715 → 786 → 822 → 834 → 850 → 871).  
3. The paper provides no rationale or empirical analysis for critical hyperparameters (kpca, ktopo, kdelay, kcorr ) or for the fixed node ratio (80% observed, 20% new, 5% deleted). Comprehensive sensitivity studies are needed to assess how these design choices affect model performance and robustness.

### Questions
1.  The description in Appendix A.3 is brief, more architectural details and a clearer diagram or pseudocode would improve reproducibility.  
2.  As the method is claimed to be model-agnostic, have the authors tested it on other STF backbones? Results on more diverse architectures and larger, evolving datasets (e.g., _Air-Stream_ or _PEMS-Stream_ with multiple expansion phases) would better demonstrate scalability.  
3.  Important hyperparameters (e.g., _kpca_, _n_, _ktopo_, _kdelay_, _kcorr_) and node ratios (80% observed, 20% new, 5% deleted) are fixed without justification. 
4.  The dataset name appears inconsistently as “NERL-AL” and “NREL-AL.” Please clarify the correct form and ensure consistency.

### Summary
This paper “introduces SNIP, which is a model-agnostic framework that tackles the challenge of expanding-node spatial-temporal forecasting, where sensor networks evolve over time (e.g., new traffic sensors are added or removed). Traditional spatio-temporal models fail in such dynamic settings because their parameters are tied to fixed node sets. SNIP breaks this dependency by constructing static node priors from historical sequences and topology, including periodic, topological, and time-delayed interaction features, with PCA and spectral embeddings to capture heterogeneity and correlations without learnable node embeddings. These priors are then dynamically refined via diffusion graph convolutions and initialized for new nodes using similarity-weighted mixtures, enabling efficient few-shot adaptation. Experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that SNIP and its instantiation SNIPformer outperform strong baselines like STEV and continual-learning approaches.

### Strengths
S1. This paper proposes the study of expanding-node spatial-temporal forecasting, a realistic yet largely neglected setting where the number of nodes in a sensor network changes over time. By formally defining this problem and identifying its key challenges, the paper establishes a research direction that better reflects operational realities and fills an important gap in the spatio-temporal forecasting literature.

S2. One of the framework’s contributions lies in its ability to dynamically adapt to new nodes with minimal data. Through a diffusion-based graph convolution refinement process, SNIP continuously updates its priors as network conditions evolve. When new nodes are introduced, it uses a similarity-weighted initialization strategy that blends knowledge from existing nodes based on their correlation strength.

S3. Empirically, the proposed model demonstrates consistent improvements across a range of benchmark datasets and evaluation settings.

### Weaknesses
W1. The paper assumes a single expanding stage for sensor nodes, which simplifies the evolving network process. In real-world systems, however, sensor deployment and removal typically occur continuously over time rather than in one expansion phase. It remains unclear how the proposed framework would handle multi-stage or streaming expansions, where node sets evolve incrementally and model adaptation must occur online.

W2. The model incurs a non-trivial preprocessing cost to compute multi-cycle PCA, cross-spectral correlations, and eigen-decompositions for spectral embeddings, especially when the full historical records are utilized for calculation. These steps may scale poorly for large networks or high-frequency data streams. 

W3. The paper proposes the Decomposition Hypothesis that optimal node promptings can be decomposed into static and dynamic components. However, this claim might be conceptually plausible and only empirically validated. There is no formal theoretical analysis when combining static priors with diffusion-based refinement.

W4.  The topology priors in SNIP are constructed directly from a fixed adjacency matrix, which may not accurately capture the true correlations or dynamic dependencies among nodes. Prior studies in spatial-temporal forecasting have shown that such predefined graphs can be suboptimal or even misleading.

### Questions
Q1. Line 201, $X_{:,:,1}$ appears to be inconsistent with the earlier definition of $X$, which is a 3-dimensional tensor.  

Q2. The connection between the diffusion convolution operation and the prediction process during the expansion phase is not entirely clear. Is the diffusion convolution applied only during the stage of $\tau_{2}$ for training?

Q3. Figure 1(b) is not very intuitive or informative in illustrating the differences among methods. The authors may consider redesigning it with clearer visual cues or a more concrete comparative example to better highlight the distinctions.

### Summary
This paper studies expanding-node spatial-temporal forecasting, a setting where sensor networks evolve over time: existing nodes may disappear, and new nodes with scarce history are added. Traditional spatio-temporal forecasting (STF) models assume a fixed node set and rely on node-specific learnable embeddings, which breaks in this setting because parameters scale with the number of nodes and new nodes have scarce data. 

The authors propose SNIP (Structured Node Interaction Prompting), a model-agnostic prompting framework that decouples model parameters from node count. SNIP constructs static node priors from historical data along three axes: periodic priors obtained via PCA over repeated temporal cycles (e.g. daily, weekly) to capture node-specific long-term behavior; topology priors from spectral embeddings of the graph Laplacian to encode structural position; and time-delayed interaction priors from cross power spectral density (CSD), capturing lagged, asymmetric correlations between nodes and their dominant propagation delays. 

These priors are concatenated and then dynamically refined during training via an MLP and diffusion graph convolution, yielding adaptive node promptings that can evolve over time. For new nodes, SNIP initializes priors using similarity-weighted mixtures of priors from "most similar" existing nodes (based on correlation strength), enabling few-shot adaptation; removed nodes incur no parameter cost because parameters are not tied to node identities. 

The proposed approach named SNIPformer injects the refined promptings into an efficient spatio-temporal encoder. Across four datasets spanning traffic and renewable energy (EPeMS, PEMS04, SeaLoop, NREL-AL), and under simulated/base - expansion/test splits, SNIPformer outperforms baselines including node-agnostic forecasters (DLinear, iTransformer), modified STGNNs/Transformers without node embeddings (e.g. GWNET, STID, STAEformer), continual-learning style prompt-tuning (EAC, STKEC), and the recent expanding-variate baseline STEV.

### Strengths
- The paper is generally well written and well structured. It identifies and formalizes the expanding-node spatial-temporal forecasting problem: networks where nodes are added and removed between a base stage and an expansion stage, with very limited data for new nodes. This moves beyond the standard fixed-node assumption used by most traffic/energy forecasting models.

- The proposed method replaces learnable node embeddings with computed priors that encode periodic temporal signatures, graph topology, and lagged inter-node coupling. The idea of treating these priors as non-learnable node identity prompts and then refining them online is a novel take on node-specific conditioning without parameter-node coupling.

- Introduces a similarity-weighted initialization procedure for new nodes, which transfers priors from existing nodes in proportion to cross-correlation strength and dominant delay, and argues that this enables few-shot adaptation for nodes with almost no history.

- The experimental protocol is fairly thorough, with four datasets across traffic and energy domains, explicit base/expansion/test stages, and explicit partitioning of nodes into remain, deleted, and new.  The baselines span models without node-specific prompting (DLinear, iTransformer, DUETformer), STGNN / Transformer backbones with their node embeddings removed (GWNET, STID, STAEformer, etc.), continual learning / expanding-graph or prompt-tuning style methods (STKEC, EAC), and STEV, which is explicitly designed for expansion-like scenarios (Expanding-Variate TS Forecasting). SNIPformer achieves best or second-best MAE/RMSE in most settings, including for new nodes, which is the hardest regime.

- Ablation studies show that both static priors (especially periodic + inter-node priors) and dynamic refinement are necessary, and that higher-variance priors improve heterogeneity. The paper also argues that SNIP is more computationally efficient than STEV because it avoids full retraining after expansion and only requires lightweight fine-tuning with precomputed priors.

### Weaknesses
- Although the datasets are real traffic / energy datasets, most expansion scenarios (except EPeMS, which follows STEV) are synthetically constructed by partitioning nodes into remain / deleted / new groups and truncating history for new nodes. The paper does not evaluate on an actual incremental deployment log (e.g., "new sensors activated on these real dates, old sensors decommissioned here"). 

- The forecasting setup is 1-hour ahead with MAE/RMSE. There’s no multi-horizon stress test (longer-ahead prediction, where structural priors might degrade)

- Time-delayed interaction prior: depends on estimating pairwise cross-spectral structure using Welch’s method with a fixed window. The method assumes reasonably stationary local coupling. The paper does not quantify sensitivity to window size, noise, or nonstationary bursts (e.g., incidents).

### Questions
- The similarity-weighted initialization for new nodes relies on reliable cross-correlation with existing nodes, but when a node is truly new (short history, novel behavior, or located in a structurally new region), those similarities may be noisy or misleading. What if new nodes are structurally isolated?

- A related line you may wish to discuss is that of GAP-LSTM (which tackles spatio-temporal forecasting on geo-distributed sensor networks by explicitly modeling spatio-temporal autocorrelation via a hybrid of graph convolution, attention-augmented LSTMs, 2-D temporal convolutions, and latent memory states), DCRNN, and GMAN, which similarly couple graph operators with temporal sequence models/attention to capture directed diffusion and dynamic cross-node dependencies.

- For PEMS04 / SeaLoop / NREL-AL, new vs deleted nodes are sampled by partition, and new nodes’ histories are artificially truncated. Do you have (or could you collect) a real deployment timeline where sensors were physically added/removed over calendar time, and evaluate SNIP there? Even a partial case study would make the problem statement more concrete.

- STEV is your closest "expanding-variate" baseline. Can you clarify where SNIP’s gains come from in the datasets where you win?

- Could SNIP be layered onto very lightweight models (e.g. DLinear) and still give gains, or does it rely on having a spatial-temporal encoder downstream to actually use the prompts?
