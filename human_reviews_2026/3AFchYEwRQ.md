## Abstract
Correlation clustering is an important unsupervised learning problem with broad applications. In this problem, we are given a labeled complete graph $G=(V,E^+ \cup E^-)$, and the optimal clustering is defined as a partition of the vertices that minimizes the $+$ edges between clusters and $-$ edges within clusters. We investigate efficient algorithms to test the \emph{cost} of correlation clustering: here, we want to know whether the graph could be (nearly) perfectly clustered (with $0$ cost) or is far away from admitting any perfect clustering. The problem has attracted significant attention aimed at modern large-scale applications, and the state-of-the-art results use $\widetilde{O}({1}/{\varepsilon^7})$ queries and time (up to log factors) to decide whether a graph is perfectly clusterable or needs to flip labels of $\varepsilon {\binom n 2}$ edges to become clusterable. In this paper, we improve this bound significantly by designing an algorithm that uses ${O}({1}/{\varepsilon^2})$ queries and time. Furthermore, we derive the first algorithm that tests the cost for the special setting of correlation clustering with $k$ clusters with ${O}(1/{\varepsilon^4})$ queries and time for constant $k$. Finally, for the special case of $k=2$, which corresponds to the strong structure balance problem in social networks, we obtain tight bounds of $\Theta({1}/{\varepsilon})$ queries -- the first set of \emph{tight} bounds in these problems. We conduct experiments on simulated and real-world datasets, and empirical results demonstrate the advantages of our algorithms.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of testing the cost of correlation clustering, i.e., to test whether the input graph $G=(V,E^+\cup E^-)$ is clusterable (with $0$ cost) or is $\varepsilon$-far away from being clusterable. Here, the cost of correlation clustering is defined to be the number of $(+)$ edges crossing different clusters and the number of $(-)$ edges in the same cluster. $\varepsilon$-far away from being clusterable means that one have to flip the labels of at least $\varepsilon\cdot \binom{n}{2}$ edges to make the graph clusterable, where $n=|V|$.

The authors proposed new testers that achieve improved query complexity compared to prior work. Specifically, 
* for correlation clustering, they gave a new tester with $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ query complexity while  previous best result is $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^7})$, 
* for correlation clustering with fixed $k\ge 2$, they give the the first nontrivial tester with $O(\frac{k^4\ln ^4 k}{\varepsilon^4})$ query complexity,
* for correlation clustering with $k=2$ (i.e., structural balance), they gave a new tester with $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity while  previous best result is $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ (all the time complexities are proportional to their query complexity). 
* Moreover, to complement their upper bounds, they gave an $\Omega(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity lower bound for structural balance problem. The proof of lower bound relies on a direct application of an existing general lower bound result (Fischer, 2024; cf. Bshouty & Goldreich, 2025) to the problem of testing structural balance.

Technically, they employ sampling-based techniques combined with Janson’s inequality to analyze the concentration of local inconsistencies, a methodological novelty compared to classical approaches using the graph removal lemma. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (from SNAP) confirm the theoretical query and runtime improvements.

### Strengths
* This paper studies a problem that is well-motivated.

* This paper improves the query complexity of testing the cost of correlation clustering from $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^7})$ to $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$, which is a substantial and clear advancement over the state of the art.

* For structural balance, the authors prove the first tight $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ bounds for testing structural balance.

* The use of Janson’s inequality for analyzing property testers in labeled graphs is elegant and potentially applicable to other testing problems.

* Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs show practical improvements in query complexity and runtime, enhancing the paper’s credibility.

* This paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
* While the theoretical improvement is substantial, the algorithms themselves are relatively straightforward extensions of uniform sampling ideas, and much of the novelty lies in tighter analysis rather than fundamentally new algorithmic constructs.

* The results for general correlation clustering and correlation clustering with fixed $k$ are not tight ($O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ vs. $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ and $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4})$ vs. $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$, respectively). The authors acknowledge this but do not deeply explore whether the bound can be improved.

* Nevertheless, I am generally supportive of this work.

### Questions
* lines 357-358: why there is a $2$ in $\sum_{1\le i<j\le s}{2\cdot \frac{1}{n^2}}$?

* about the proof of Lemma 3.1: It samples $O(\frac{k\ln k}{\varepsilon})$ vertices and for each iterated vertex $u$, it will perform at most $k$ queries. Why is the total number of queries $O(\frac{k\ln k}{\varepsilon})$ rather than $O(\frac{k^2\ln k}{\varepsilon})$?

**Typos:**

* lines 362-363: missing a period after the inequality

* lines 756-757: we may assume that $t>k$, since a graph ... $\rightarrow$ we may assume that $t>k$, since **otherwise** a graph ...?

### Summary
This paper studies the correlation clustering (CC) problem from the perspective of property test. Theoretically, it yields three results for clusterability, $k$-clusterability ($k$ is a constant), and $2$-clusterability (also called strong balanceness), respectively. The query complexity $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ for clusterability gets a great improvement from the SOTA results using $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^7)$. The query complexity $O(1/\varepsilon^4)$ for $k$-clusterability is new, and that for $2$-clusterability $O(1/\varepsilon)$ has reached the tight lower bound up to a constant factor. The testing algorithms are evaluated by experiments on simulated and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The theoretical results are solid.

2. It provides more insights to the CC testing problem (e.g., the hit of bad triangles and the use of Janson's inequality).

### Weaknesses
1. I am skeptical about the practical merits of the CC problem. Requiring a complete graph as input is an overly stringent condition that is rarely satisfied in real-world scenarios. While the authors have presented experimental results on real-world datasets, it remains unclear how they converted the six real-world graphs into complete ones, nor how they assigned +/- signals to missing edges. So I am uncertain about the significance of these experiments. I acknowledge that this paper has theoretical significance. If I were reviewing it for a TCS venue like SODA or STOC, I would not raise this concern. However, for an AI venue, clarifying its practical relevance is essential.

   A more interesting variant of the CC problem appears to take a general graph as input and count the misclassified edges. However, the methodology to address this variant would be entirely different.

2. There are some unclear points and minor issues. Please refer to the Questions.

### Questions
1. The definitions of some key concepts are missing. I didn't find the formal definition of "structural balance". The authors have defined the weak and strong versions of structural balance in the Introduction section. It seems that structural balance refers specifically to $2$-clusterable, isn't it? The definition of "bad triangles" is also missing.

2. The figures in Section 4.2 is confusing. What's the difference between the blue and orange lines? Or say, what is the difference between structural balance and correlation clustering? Do they have the same number of clusters? Does a YES answer mean "clusterable"? Why its rate is nearly zero small (especially for structural balance) when the distance parameter $\varepsilon$ is small?

3. It is better to introduce Janson's inequality in a separate section in appendices for the readers who are not familiar with it.

### Summary
The paper presents property-testing algorithms for correlation clustering and balance property in graphs. Compared to previous work, the paper presents improved bounds, and in addition it presents a new sampling algorithm for testing k-clusterability, which as far as I understand, is a newly introduced problem. The paper gives a good overview of previous results, states its contributions clearly, provides a sketch techniques while full proofs are in the appendix, and presents an empirical evaluation of the methods.

### Strengths
S1. Solid problem formulation, improving and extending earlier work. 
S2. Theoretically rigorous paper, giving a good intuition of the techniques and presenting full proofs in the appendix.
S3. Well written paper, presenting a clear motivation, highlighting the contributions and main results, and presenting the methods with clarity.
S4. Theoretical results are accompanied with an empirical evaluation.

### Weaknesses
W1. While O(1/epsilon^2) is a significant improvement over \tilde{O}(1/epsilon^7), I found that the two results are not directly comparable because the earlier work of AA2023 tests of cost smaller than epsilon/10, while the current work tests for cost=0. So, I think that the current paper solves a much easier problem. Furthermore, this limitation is significant in practice, as the method essentially does not tolerate any noise, which is highly unrealistic for real-world applications. I think that the author(s) should have been more clear about this important distinction, during the discussion and when presenting Table 1. This weakness is my main motivation for not suggesting the paper for acceptance. 
W2. While researching for sublinear-time methods, I think that in practice a linear algorithm is often good enough. In this sense, I think that the paper would be a better fit for a venue in theoretical computer science.

### Questions
I would be very interested in seeing the response of the author(s) in point W1, above.

### Summary
This paper studies property testing for correlation clustering and structural balance in dense labeled graphs. It improves the known query complexity, and achieves a tight bound for the two-cluster (balance) case. Novel results, for the $k$ clusters case are also given. The improvement comes primarily from a cleaner probabilistic analysis using Janson’s inequality, rather than from a new algorithmic idea.

### Strengths
- **Analytical improvement over prior bounds.**  
The work reduces the query complexity for testing correlation clustering from $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^7)$ to $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$, and achieves a tight $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ bound for the special case $k=2$. Although the improvement stems mainly from a sharper analysis, the result is still valuable as it narrow an asymptotic gap. Furthermore, the application of Janson’s inequality to handle dependent random variables is mathematically clean and simplifies the analysis. While not conceptually deep, it removes several unnecessary factors and clarifies the dependence on $\varepsilon$. Finally, the case for $k$-clusters seems novel.

- **Theoretically relevant within property testing.**  
Within the dense-graph property testing framework, correlation clustering is a natural and well-motivated property. The paper contributes a clearer understanding of its sample complexity, which is of interest to the theory community.

### Weaknesses
- **Primarily analytical, not algorithmic, contribution.**  
The main improvement derives from a tighter analysis rather than a novel testing algorithm. The core testing procedure remains essentially unchanged from prior work, and the use of Janson’s inequality, while effective, is a straightforward application of a standard concentration tool.

- **Limited depth of the probabilistic insight.**  
The argument simplifies the dependency structure among sampled edges but does not introduce new combinatorial or probabilistic ideas. The simplicity of the improvement raises the question of why such a refinement was not already known.

- **Coarse granularity of the testing objective.**  
As in all property testing formulations, the test only distinguishes between perfectly clusterable graphs ($\mathrm{OPT}=0$) and those that are $\varepsilon$-far from such structure ($\mathrm{OPT} \ge \varepsilon \binom{n}{2}$). This dichotomy is extremely coarse and offers little interpretive value for practical clustering, where intermediate cases are the norm.

- **Relevance limited to dense theoretical settings.**  
The dense graph model and the assumption of oracle access to edge labels make the results largely theoretical. The test loses meaning when $\varepsilon = O(1/n)$, since the query complexity becomes $\Theta(n^2)$, equivalent to reading the entire input. The authors do not discuss this limitation. Moreover, while the $k$-clusters case is novel the $k^4 \log^4 k$ runtime seems problematic.

- **Moderate originality.**  
The methodological novelty is incremental, and the improvement, though useful, does not introduce a fundamentally new perspective or analysis technique.

### Overall evaluation

This is a technically solid and clearly written paper that refines the analysis of property testing for correlation clustering. The results are correct, and the improvements close an asymptotic gap in query complexity, but the novelty is mostly analytical rather than conceptual or algorithmic. The paper will interest the property testing and theoretical graph learning communities, though its impact on broader learning theory or clustering practice is limited.
