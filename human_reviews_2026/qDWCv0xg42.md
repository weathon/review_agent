## Abstract
Recommender systems shape online interactions by matching users with creators’ content to maximize engagement. Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users’ preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users’ preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this users-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubbles effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably,  opinion clustering is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions.  Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.

### Summary
This paper proposes a model to analyze the opinions of users and content creators in a social network, where their interactions are mediated by a recommender system.  Using this model, the authors theoretically analyze the effect of different recommendation strategies and propose a social network-aware recommender system that accounts for the interaction between users and creators to drive the social network towards a steady state opinion that is less clustered compared to e.g., the highly polarized status quo of existing social networks that primarily optimize recommendations for user engagement.

### Strengths
This work distinguishes itself from prior work by considering an interplay between users and content creators, where the content creators are actually strategic and adapt their material to grow their audience.

There are theoretical results to support the findings discussed in the experiments, which is a nice addition to the paper and helps to contextualize things.

The experimental results are strong and demonstrate the paper’s claim that a recommender system which optimizes for both user satisfaction and avoids clustering has a meaningful impact on both metrics, and captures a “middle ground” between myopically maximizing engagement and maximizing content diversity.

### Weaknesses
The definition of satisfaction (cumulative difference of opinion between users and creators they interact with over time) makes sense, but the connection between satisfaction (in this sense) and engagement is not completely clear to me — the paper cites a classic paper on confirmation bias to argue that high confirmation bias = high engagement, but I suspect that engagement on modern social media platforms may be more nuanced (e.g., strategically showing users some content they disagree with might spur engagement in the form of comments, arguments, etc.)

Writing is, at times, difficult to parse.  As one example, at the end of the introduction, the following sentence is particularly difficult for me to understand: “We argue that, being opinion polarization a collective phenomenon, in order for the RS to mitigate such undesired effect, enhancing content diversification is not enough without taking the social network into account.”

The network size considered (N = 600 users) is fairly small, and the initial topology is randomly generated.  Furthermore, the random generation process is not based on, and is not compared with, one of the many random graph models that are known to create "real-looking" networks (two examples of such models are the Newman-Watts-Strogatz [1] and Barabasi-Albert [2] models).
This is in contrast to other papers such as [3] that evaluate on real social network data sets, including a data set with thousands of users [4].

### Questions
It is convincing that society should care about opinion polarization and its effects, but it is not clear to me that the entities who control (the majority of) recommender systems care about it.  The work tries to address this by proposing a recommender system that maintains a high level of “user satisfaction,” arguing that this is a good proxy for optimizing for engagement.  In the experiments, the paper shows that a recommender system optimized for engagement increases clustering.

For a social media platform to adopt an alternative that reduces opinion clusterization, I would guess that one would have to demonstrate a recommender system with both high engagement and low clustering, which may be infeasible.  It is possible that public pressure or regulation could compel these platforms to act, but such reforms seem like they would be  challenging to verify/enforce.  Can you speculate about how this work would relate to efforts in the real world?

On line 55, I believe “harmuful” should be “harmful”. 

The proposed socially-aware recommender system takes the network structure into account when making recommendations.  At the scale of large social networks, is scalability a concern for such an algorithm?  It may be slow/infeasible to exactly recover the mean opinion of the d-hop influencers of each user in a real-time recommender setting — some discussion on this point may be helpful.  Similarly, it may be useful to report runtime measurements for the standard (engagement maximizing) recommender system versus the proposed socially-aware system in the Appendix.

### Summary
The paper studies a three-sided system involving users, content creators, and a recommender system (RS). At each timestep, both user and creator opinions co-evolve. Users are influenced by two factors: their social network (connected users), and the content they consume from creators. Content creators, in turn, are influenced primarily by user opinions.

The recommender system matches creators to users using a top-k closest-opinion criterion.
The authors analyze how different recommender strategies shape the system’s long-term dynamics: A greedy recommender, which optimizes purely for user satisfaction, tends to drive cluster formation (polarization) among creators. A non-greedy recommender can reduce this clusterization but at the cost of lower user satisfaction. Finally, the authors propose a socially aware recommender, denoted RS(d), which introduces a tunable parameter d — the number of hops in the social network considered for matching. This allows the system to interpolate between maximizing user satisfaction (d=0) and minimizing clusterization (larger d).

### Strengths
The paper makes an original contribution to the study of opinion dynamics in systems involving users, content creators, and recommender algorithms. While prior work such as Lin et al. has modeled the co-evolution of user and creator opinions, the introduction of user–user interactions through a social network makes the modelling more realistic. The model formulation is clear and well-motivated. 

The socially aware recommender system, RS(d), that can interpolate between maximizing user satisfaction and reducing clusterization by tuning the parameter d (the number of hops in the social network) is both elegant and conceptually sound.
The main technical contributions, especially in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.2, are well executed. The authors show that:

- A greedy recommender focused solely on user satisfaction leads to creator clusterization;
- A non-greedy recommender reduces clusterization but lowers user satisfaction; and
- The proposed RS(d) strikes a balance between these extremes, offering a controllable trade-off.

### Weaknesses
The modeling and results are insightful, but there are areas where the presentation and clarity should be improved:

1.  The main contribution statements.
The description of the paper’s key findings in the introduction and contribution section could be made more precise and technical. For example:
- The statement “We demonstrate that opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of the RS” could be revised to:
 “We show that a recommender system (RS) that greedily optimizes for user satisfaction leads to opinion cluster formation among creators.”
- Similarly, instead of “We provide a new optimization-based RS that explicitly incorporates social connections to reduce clusterization effects while keeping a high level of user satisfaction,” a clearer version might be:
 “We propose a social-network–aware recommender, RS(d), where the parameter d (number of user hops) controls the trade-off between user satisfaction and the extent of creator clustering, with low d leading to higher satisfaction but more clusters, and high d reducing clusters at the cost of satisfaction.”



2) Improve the organization of related work.
 The related work section would benefit from a comparison table (either in the main text or appendix). The table could clearly indicate for each prior work whether users and creators are modeled as static or dynamic, and whether the recommender system is fixed or explicitly designed.
This addition would make it easier to identify the specific novelty of this paper which is the introduction of user–user social interactions and the co-evolution of user opinions influenced by both their social network and content creators.
For example, Lin et al. include a helpful summary table in their appendix that clarifies which axes of the opinion dynamics problem each prior work explored. Adopting a similar approach here would highlight the distinct contributions of this work and improve readability.

### Questions
Q1. What happens to the evolution of creator opinions in the special case where 
$(I_M​−T)E=0$, i.e., when creators evolve solely based on user opinion feedback without creator coupling? Do the qualitative results presented in Section 4 (particularly regarding clusterization and satisfaction trade-offs) still hold under this condition, or does the system converge differently?

Q2. In Equation (13), the user opinion is defined as the average opinion of all users within d hops, and this aggregated opinion u_i is then used for top-k creator selection. In the limiting case where d is very large, all users would share approximately the same aggregated opinion and hence receive similar recommendations. How does this affect the evolution of creator opinions?

### Summary
The user-creator feedback interaction is known to cause filter bubbles and polarization in recommender systems.  This paper develops a social-network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for the user-creator feedback interaction and exploits the topology of the social network to promote diversity of the system.  In particular, the paper proposes to recommend to a user contents that are close to the average of the user's neighbors. Simulations show that this method reduces polarization/clusterization, while maintaining a certain level of user satisfaction.

### Strengths
(S1) This paper introduces a new perspective to the study of user-creator feedback interaction in recommender systems: social network.  In addition to the recommended content, users' opinions are also affected by their neighbors on the social network.  This paper shows that such social network structure can be leveraged to reduce polarization.  This is an interesting observation.  It is a good positive contribution to the largely negative literature on polarization in recommender systems.

### Weaknesses
However, I have major concerns about the theoretical rigor of this work. 

(W1) **Lack of a formal definition of “influence” in Theorem 1**.  Theorem 1 claims that "increasing the influence of A reduces the influence of B". Here, A and B are matrices describing social and recommender effects, but the paper never defines what "influence" means in a quantitative sense.  Although the notation suggests that A and B affect users’ steady-state opinions, the authors do not provide a scalar metric (e.g., a norm, spectral quantity, or sensitivity measure) that maps these matrices to real-valued influences. As a result, the statement “increase of A decreases B” is ambiguous and cannot be rigorously evaluated. The theorem would benefit from a precise mathematical formulation of “influence” and clear assumptions under which this complementarity holds.

(W2) **Key proofs didn't consider the steady-state of dynamics**.  The proofs of Lemma 1, Corollary 1, and Lemma 2 analyze user-creator interactions without explicitly accounting for the steady-state of the dynamic system.  Since both users and creators evolve under feedback loops and social influence (the Friedkin-Johnsen model), the asymptotic behavior (i.e., equilibrium or stability conditions) is critical to determining long-term clusterization outcomes. However, the proofs in Appendix E appear to rely on instantaneous or static relationships rather than steady-state analysis of the full dynamics.  Without establishing convergence properties or equilibrium characterizations, these results may not generalize to the long-run behavior claimed in the paper.



Another concern: 

(W3) The proposed "socially-aware recommender" recommends contents that are close to the average of the neighbors of a user.  How is this method compared to practices like "your friends may like these" recommendations, and other methods in the literature that consider users' social network?  Such comparisons are missing.

### Summary
This paper introduces a closed-loop model of users, creators, and recommender systems using multi-topic opinion dynamics. It theoretically shows that greedy recommendation increases opinion clusterization, and proposes a socially-aware d-hop recommender that leverages neighborhood opinions to balance satisfaction and polarization.

### Strengths
1. Clear formulation of a closed-loop social–RS dynamic.
2. Provides a simple, interpretable design knob (d-hop neighborhood).
3. Theoretical complementarity between social and RS influence is insightful.
4. Experiments illustrate a meaningful satisfaction–clusterization trade-off.

### Weaknesses
1. Theoretical results rely on static user partitions, deterministic recommendations (k=1), and diagonal social influence matrices—settings that largely remove true social interactions. Lemma-level assumptions are not empirically validated, and the gap between deterministic theory and stochastic simulations (softmax sampling) remains unaddressed.
2. All experiments use synthetic networks constructed from initial opinion similarity, which risks circular reasoning regarding clusterization. Only 2-D opinion space is tested, with no validation on real or semi-synthetic social graphs or content interaction data.
3. The paper does not compare with standard diversification or exposure-aware recommenders (e.g., MMR, xQuAD, calibrated ranking). It is unclear whether the proposed d-hop social averaging offers benefits beyond existing diversity mechanisms.
4. Clusterization is measured solely via the silhouette coefficient on k-means clusters. Alternative graph-level or diversity metrics (e.g., assortativity, modularity, diversity@k) are not reported, and sensitivity to the clustering hyperparameters is not discussed.
5. Results are shown only for a few d and k values; key parameters and noise robustness are not systematically explored.

### Summary
This paper studies how recommender systems that optimize for engagement can increase opinion polarization and clusterization. The authors introduce a socially-aware recommender system that explicitly incorporates users’ social network structure into the recommendation process. They model the joint dynamics of users, content creators, and the RS using an extended FJ opinion dynamics model. It presents some theoretical results showing that social influence and recommendation influence can act as contrary forces.

### Strengths
- The idea of theoretically analyzing the interaction between recommendation and social networks under FJ model (with high-dimensional opinions) is novel.
- The paper is theoretically solid, despite some simplified assumptions.
- The studied topic is still of great importance nowadays.

### Weaknesses
1. I think this paper has not phrased its main contributions accurately. It claims to have developed a socially-aware recommendation system, but this idea is not novel. Most mainstream social media platform these days such as Meta and LinkedIn have used social networks in their recommendations with algorithms taking care of topic diversification and polarization. The proposed recommendation system in Section is more of a high-level idea sketch rather than any real system that can operate on real-world data. I think the main novelty of this paper, instead, is that it analyzes the relationship between engagement-based recommendation with polarization, under a theoretical framework, which yields some theoretical insights for industrial practice. It is very important in this regard to clarify the scope and limitation of any conclusions made in this paper.
2. The experiment is very limited. The data is small, synthesized in a naive way, and only one experiment is presented. Please significantly expand the experiment section.
3. Discussion of many related works that study the relationship between recommendation and polarization under FJ framework is missing, for example, [1-3].
4. There are many typos in the paper: “explotied” → “exploited”, “harmuful” → “harmful”, “explicitely” → “explicitly”, “recieve” → “receive”, “deigns” → “designs”, “sweetspot” → “sweet spot”.
