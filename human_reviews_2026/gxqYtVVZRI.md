## Abstract
We tackle spatio-temporal interpolation for virtual sensors in sparse, partially observed, and dynamically changing networks. We introduce DynaSTI, a diffusion-based generative framework that is fully inductive to unseen locations, trains directly on incomplete observations, and remains effective without retraining when sensor networks change with time. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified conditioning strategy that yields calibrated predictive distributions and robust performance under severe input-sensor dropout; (ii) a Fourier-domain compression variant, FDynaSTI, that accelerates sampling performance, and (iii) state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world datasets, improving both RMSE and CRPS relative to strong baselines. Together, these results establish diffusion-based, frequency-aware probabilistic interpolation as a scalable solution for real-world, dynamic sensor networks.

### Summary
This paper presents DynaSTI, a diffusion-based framework for spatio-temporal imputation that models uncertainty under dynamic sensor topologies. The method integrates spatial cross-attention, temporal and feature DiT encoders, and introduces a frequency-domain variant (FDynaSTI) for improved runtime efficiency.

### Strengths
The framework is modular and conceptually well-motivated, combining diffusion with attention for flexible inductive inference. The frequency-domain variant (FDynaSTI) effectively demonstrates the potential of harmonic compression for long time series.

### Weaknesses
- Regarding the method, while FDynaSTI improves runtime through frequency-domain compression, the overall framework integrates diffusion (iterative denoising) with full attention modules, which likely incurs substantial computational overhead. The paper reports only performance metrics without any inference time comparison table. It is necessary to clarify the adopted sampling strategy (e.g., DDIM), specify the denoising step number K, and include a performance-versus-diffusion-step analysis.
- Regarding related work, several closely relevant spatio-temporal interpolation models [1–2] are missing from the discussion. Additionally, the citation of USTD around line 71 seems to correspond to [4] rather than [3]?
- Regarding experiments, the study does not evaluate on large-scale datasets such as [5], and strong recent baselines, including ImputeFormer, are absent from the comparison, limiting the empirical comprehensiveness.

### Summary
The paper introduces DynaSTI, a diffusion-based generative framework for estimating missing or unobserved sensor data in dynamic and incomplete sensor networks. Unlike prior models that require fixed sensor configurations, DynaSTI generalizes to unseen locations without retraining and handles missing data directly through a unified conditioning strategy that integrates spatial, temporal, and feature information. A Fourier-domain variant accelerates inference by compressing time series into trend and seasonality components. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that DynaSTI achieves better accuracy and uncertainty calibration, outperforming baselines while maintaining robustness under sensor dropout and dynamic network changes.

### Strengths
1. The method is well-designed for dynamic sensor topologies and inductive generalization, and Fourier variant accelerates inference significantly without significant accuracy loss.

2. It shows clear SOTA results in both deterministic and probabilistic metrics with maintain accuracy under highly incomplete rates.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks sufficient description (although table 2 shows datasets description) or visualization of the datasets, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with those 4 real-world datasets to assess task complexity or interpretability. For example, the reason behind the split of training/testing locations, and how they separate each other or the topology examples. 

2. From the problem setup, the mask is fixed locations on the spatial coordinates, but times are regularly sampled not missing and masks are fixed across whole timesteps. In contrast, other studies address scenarios where data are missing in both spatial and temporal dimensions, with missing observations varying at each timestep - a considerably more challenging setting. I am wondering whether the proposed method maintains robust under these more challenging scenarios.

### Questions
1. Equation (1) has typo on the parentheses.

### Summary
The paper proposes a diffusion-model framework for spatio-temporal interpolation in settings where sensor networks are sparse, partially observed, and dynamically changing over time. The proposed method, DynaSTI can handle unseen locations and arbitrary missing sensor observations by conditioning its diffusion denoising process on available sensor observations and their spatial coordinates. The model integrates spatial, temporal, and feature encoders to capture multi-scale dependencies and introduces a Fourier-domain compression (FDynaSTI) to accelerate inference for long time sequences. Evaluated on real-world datasets, DynaSTI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and probabilistic calibration (CRPS) while maintaining robustness under sensor dropout.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a practical problem with high flexibility, supporting dynamically changing sensor configurations over time, and effectively handling unseen irregular locations as well as missing observations.

The trend+seasonality representation is effective that incurs minimal coefficient-fitting overhead while enabling significantly faster sampling, with the rFFT initialization shown to be empirically useful.

DynaSTI and FDynaSTI consistently outperform all compared methods in terms of both RMSE and CRPS.

### Weaknesses
In this paper, "dynamic" refers to the sensor network changing over time, while the observation distribution remains stationary. The authors should clarify this distinction in the introduction. 

Spatial cross-attention can be computationally expensive since the method uses all observations to predict the target location. The author has handled the temporal computation cost with trend+seasonality representation, while didn't provide a solution for spatial overhead. 

In the experimental section, although the paper claims to provide probabilistic predictions, it only reports CRPS. Additional calibration metric could be added to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Questions
Line 420 states "DynaSTI leads on AWN and NACSE," but this appears inconsistent with Table 4. Could the authors clarify which is correct?

What are the average iteration counts and wall-clock times for the Fourier coefficient fitting at inference per target location? How sensitive is accuracy to F?

### Summary
The paper proposes a diffusion model for virtual sensing in inductive sensing. The proposed design appears reasonable and achieves fairly good empirical results on a selection of datasets. I have reviewed a previous version of this paper for a different venue, and I commend the authors for improving the discussion of related work. However, the technical novelty of the paper remains limited, and its contributions are still unclear.

### Strengths
- The proposed model provides a reasonable approach for performing missing sensor inference in spatiotemporal data. 
- The empirical results are good, but there are missing baselines and insufficient details on how the included baselines were tuned.

### Weaknesses
- **Unclear contribution and limited technical novelty.** The contributions of the paper relative to the state of the art remain unclear.  
    - The authors summarize the properties of their model in Table 1, but the table shows that a model with analogous characteristics could easily be obtained by combining existing components. In particular, diffusion models for spatiotemporal virtual sensing already exist [1]. The authors claim that their model compares favorably to [1] because the latter uses short input sequences and a fixed graph. However, these limitations can be easily resolved with existing techniques; therefore, the technical novelty of the paper appears limited.  
    - In line 72, the paper states: “While USTD meets all criteria in Table 1, the public implementation restricts sequences to 12 or 24 steps, so we were unable to run it on our datasets, which have longer sequences.” Adjusting the input sequence length should not be difficult and should not prevent a direct comparison.  
    - The reference for USTD is incorrect; it should refer to [1], not to “Tang et al.”  
    - As mentioned above, diffusion models have already been applied to virtual sensing. Likewise, the idea of learning representations in the frequency domain is common in existing methods—for example, [2] combines both diffusion and frequency-domain representations for spatiotemporal forecasting. Therefore, the technical novelty and contributions of this paper appear limited and poorly explained.  

- **Empirical evaluation.**  
    - How were the baselines tuned for the empirical evaluation? How were the hyperparameters selected?  
    - Table 7 reports inference time, but what about training time?
