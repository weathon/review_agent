- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 4, 2, 6, 4

## Abstract
Modeling the temporal dynamics of the human brain remains a core challenge in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Traditional methods often ignore the biological spike characteristics of brain activity and find it difficult to reveal the dynamic dependencies and causal interactions between brain regions, limiting their effectiveness in brain function research and clinical applications. To address this issue, we propose a Spike-based Digital Brain (Spike-DB), a novel fundamental model that introduces the spike computing paradigm into brain time series modeling. Spike-DB encodes fMRI signals as spike trains and learns the temporal driving relationships between anchor and target regions to achieve high-precision prediction of brain activity and reveal underlying causal dependencies and dynamic relationship characteristics. Based on Spike-DB, we further conducted downstream tasks including brain disease classification, abnormal brain region identification, and effective connectivity inference. Experimental results on real-world epilepsy datasets and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that Spike-DB outperforms existing mainstream methods in both prediction accuracy and downstream tasks, demonstrating its broad potential in clinical applications and brain science research. Our code is available at https://github.com/UAIBC-Brain/Spike-DB.

### Summary
This paper proposes **Spike-DB**, a spike-based computing framework for modeling fMRI data. The model encodes fMRI signals into spike trains through a differentiable integrate-and-fire mechanism, applies a masked region prediction strategy to learn inter-regional dependencies, and decodes the resulting spike representations for reconstruction and analysis. Spike-DB achieves better performance than the compared state-of-the-art methods on data prediction and brain disease classification tasks. It also provides interpretability analyses, including abnormal region detection and effective connectivity mapping. The framework represents an attempt to unify spiking neural computation with brain modeling. However, its biological justification for applying spike encoding to slow fMRI signals is limited, and its evaluation on only two datasets constrains generalization.

### Strengths
1. While more biological justification is needed, the idea of using SNN-like processing for brain activity modeling represents an attempt to bridge computational neuroscience and machine learning.  

2. The proposed Spike-DB framework is clearly structured and includes explicit mathematical formulations, making it easy to follow.  

3. The manuscript is well organized and features high-quality figures.  

4. The proposed Spike-DB model has been tested on diverse tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper’s core claim is to “encode fMRI signals as spike trains.” However, fMRI BOLD signals are slow hemodynamic measures (around 1 Hz), not neural spikes (around 10-1000 Hz). Compared with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution, spike-based computing is more suitable for modalities with high temporal resolution, such as iEEG or EEG. How do the authors justify the biological meaning of such a design when applied to fMRI data?  

2. The model uses generic spike encoders and decoders without linking parameters (τ_m, τ_s, thresholds) to realistic neural biophysics or cortical circuitry. Claims of “biological interpretability” are therefore not well supported.

3. The authors claim that they are the first to introduce the spike computing paradigm into brain time-series modeling. However, earlier works have treated fMRI data as spike trains, though in slightly different ways, for example:  
   [a] Kasabov, Nikola K., Maryam Gholami Doborjeh, and Zohreh Gholami Doborjeh. *“Mapping, learning, visualization, classification, and understanding of fMRI data in the NeuCube evolving spatiotemporal data machine of spiking neural networks.”* IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems 28.4 (2016): 887–899.  
   Hence, this claim should be softened.  

4. The authors fix the number of anchor regions to 89 out of 90 total, leaving only one region to predict. This setup trivializes the prediction task, as each region is almost self-predictive given its high autocorrelation.  

5. Minor differences (about 1-2%) are presented as “state of the art,” which is not statistically justified. Standard deviations should also be reported to assess robustness across random seeds.  

6. The paper reports disease classification results based on the learned spike representations, but the implementation details of this task are not clearly described. It is unclear whether a multi-layer perceptron, a linear classifier, or another model was used, and whether the SNN backbone was frozen or fine-tuned during training. The paper also omits details such as the loss function, optimization setup, and evaluation protocol. Clarifying these aspects and reporting variance across runs would strengthen the reproducibility and reliability of the classification results.  

7. Only one public dataset and one collected dataset are used for evaluation, making it difficult to demonstrate the method’s generalization and reliability. More publicly available datasets should be included to evaluate the proposed approach.  

8. The authors replace causal modeling with simple perturbation differences. Whether these results correlate with true causal effects needs to be carefully justified.  

9. Finally, no code, model weights, or preprocessing scripts are provided, which harms reproducibility.

### Questions
1.How do you justify applying spike-based encoding to slow fMRI BOLD signals ( around 1 Hz)? Why is this paradigm appropriate for fMRI rather than higher-temporal-resolution modalities like EEG or iEEG? 

2.How were τ_m, τ_s, and threshold values chosen? Do they have any neurophysiological grounding or sensitivity analysis?  

3.How does Spike-DB differ fundamentally from earlier fMRI–SNN works (e.g., NeuCube, Kasabov et al., 2016)? 
 
4.Will fix 89 anchor regions and predict only one be affected by fMRI’ high autocorrelation of near region?

5.Please report standard deviations and significance tests to confirm the 1–2% improvements.  

6.What classifier (MLP, linear, etc.) was used? Was the backbone frozen or fine-tuned? What loss and evaluation protocol were applied? 
 
7.Please evaluate Spike-DB on additional public datasets to demonstrate robustness and effectiveness.

8.How does your perturbation-based EC relate to established causal models (e.g., DCM, Granger)? Any validation against known connections?  

9.Will you release code, model weights, and preprocessing scripts to enable replication?

I will raise my score if these issues are well addressed.

### Summary
This paper introduces Spike-DB, a framework that converts fMRI time series into discrete “spike” events and trains spike Transformer with a masked-region prediction objective. The learned embeddings are then used for downstream tasks such as detecting abnormal brain regions and classifying neurological diseases. Experiments on two disease datasets show improvements over selected baselines, and ablations aim to assess the contribution of the spike encoding were performed.

### Strengths
Framing fMRI analysis as digital spiking signal is a fresh and interesting direction.

### Weaknesses
* Because fMRI measures BOLD signals rather than direct neural spiking, the biological interpretability of the discrete spikes remains unclear. It would be valuable to connect the event representation to known hemodynamic dynamics or evaluate on a modality closer to neural spiking (e.g., iEEG).

* The need to train separate embedding models for frontal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy, different levels of cognitive impairment, and healthy controls for each dataset suggests limited cross-condition generalization. This raises concerns about whether the method captures broadly generalizable biological features versus dataset- or subtype-specific cues.

### Questions
* Is the train/test spilt subject-based or data-based? What was the training data used the downstream classifiers? What is the training procedure for downstream tasks? If the same training data was used in the pretrain and decoding, how does an end-to-end model trained directly for the downstream task (without the spike pretext stage) perform relative to Spike-DB?

* How exactly was the “no spiking” ablation implemented? Did you remove only the spike encoding while keeping the Spike Transformer?

### Summary
This paper presents a new fundamental model, the Spike-based Digital Brain (Spike-DB), which addresses the limitations of continuous-valued frameworks in brain modeling. A key contribution of this paper is the first-time application of the spike computing paradigm to fMRI time series analysis. The model converts blood oxygenation level-dependent signals into spike trains using an IIR filter-based SNN and is trained via a self-supervised, predictive mechanism (learning from 'anchor' to 'target' regions) on a Spike Transformer architecture.

The authors validate Spike-DB using epilepsy and ADNI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both fMRI time series prediction and brain disease classification when compared against several leading fundamental and specialized models. The model's clinical utility is further explored through downstream tasks, where it successfully identified abnormal brain regions and inferred effective connectivity patterns that were consistent with existing medical research.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written, making it easy to follow and understand.
- The authors define clear research questions (RQs) and validate claims thoroughly via SOTA comparison (RQ1), clinical interpretation (RQ2), and ablation studies (RQ3).
- The paper's novel contribution, being the first to apply spike computing to fMRI modeling, is not merely a conceptual claim. The authors successfully validate this approach by demonstrating that their proposed paradigm, when practically embedded in the Spike-DB model, leads directly to new SOTA performance over existing methods.
- The model shows meaningful clinical utility by identifying abnormal brain regions and connectivity patterns that are well-supported by existing medical research.

### Weaknesses
- The idea of converting slow, hemodynamic fMRI signals into discrete, fast neural spikes may lack sufficient biological justification and could be conceptually problematic.
- The model's claimed flexibility (implied in Fig. 1) is contradicted by its reliance on an extreme parameter setting. Optimal performance is achieved when $K$ = 89 out of 90 total ROIs, leaving 'only one target region'. This suggests the model is highly optimized for a very specific 'predict-one-from-all' task, not a general masking strategy. This high sensitivity is confirmed by the ablation study, which shows performance 'deteriorates significantly' as K decreases ($K$ < 45, as shown in subsection 3.6), raising concerns about the model's practical flexibility.
- To fully understand the practical trade-offs of the proposed method, an analysis of the computational overhead is required. The Spike Transformer and SNN layers are typically resource-intensive when simulated on standard GPUs (like the RTX 4090 used) compared to the standard Transformer baselines. A discussion or comparison of training time and resource usage was not included. This analysis would be valuable in future work, as it would provide a more complete picture of the costs associated with the SOTA performance reported in Tables 1 & 2.

### Questions
- Q1. How can we be certain that the model's superior performance truly stems from being 'closer to the biological nervous system', and not simply from the IIR filter-based SNN acting as a highly effective non-linear feature extractor for the specific temporal dynamics of BOLD data? I'm curious about the authors' opinions.
- Q2. To better assess the practical trade-offs, could the authors provide a comparison of computational costs (e.g., training time, resource usage) against the baselines? This information would be a valuable addition for evaluating the model's real-world applicability.

### Summary
This paper proposes Spike-Based Digital Brain (Spike-DB), a novel computational framework designed to model brain activity by integrating spike-based neural computation with fMRI time-series prediction. The method encodes continuous fMRI signals into discrete spike trains using an IIR-based spiking neuron model, aiming to capture temporal dependencies more effectively and in a biologically inspired manner. Spike-DB learns to predict the activity of target brain regions from selected anchor regions, enabling a self-supervised learning paradigm that mimics information flow in the brain. The trained model is further applied to several downstream tasks, including brain disease classification, abnormal brain region identification, and effective connectivity inference.

### Strengths
This paper presents an interesting idea of using spike-based computation for modeling brain activity, which offers a fresh perspective compared to standard fMRI analysis methods. The proposed framework, Spike-DB, is technically sound and reasonably well explained, with clear figures and equations that make the approach understandable. The authors also provide experimental results showing small but consistent improvements over existing baselines, suggesting that the method has potential.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of this paper stem from issues of biological plausibility, reproducibility, and evaluation scope. Most notably, the conversion of low-temporal-resolution fMRI BOLD signals into high-frequency spike trains is conceptually problematic, as fMRI data reflect slow, indirect hemodynamic responses rather than true neural spiking activity. This makes the biological interpretation of the model questionable and undermines its claim of being a biologically inspired “digital brain.” Additionally, the study lacks reproducibility, since no implementation code, pretrained models, or detailed preprocessing procedures are provided, making it difficult for others to verify the reported results. Finally, the experiments are confined to two relatively small datasets (epilepsy and ADNI), limiting the model’s generalizability and raising concerns about potential overfitting and the robustness of the findings.

### Questions
1. Biological Implausibility of Spike Conversion:
The transformation of low-temporal-resolution fMRI BOLD signals into high-frequency spike trains is not physiologically realistic. Since fMRI measures slow hemodynamic responses rather than actual neural spiking activity, this conversion undermines the biological credibility of the proposed “spike-based” framework and weakens the paper’s neuroscientific claims.

2. Limited Reproducibility:
The paper lacks publicly available code, pretrained models, and detailed data preprocessing information. Without these resources, the reported results cannot be independently verified, which significantly limits the work’s transparency and scientific reproducibility.

3. Restricted Evaluation Scope:
The experiments are confined to two relatively small datasets (epilepsy and ADNI), without cross-dataset or large-scale validation. This narrow evaluation raises concerns about the model’s robustness, risk of overfitting, and generalization to broader neuroimaging domains.
