## Abstract
Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties.
To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity.
Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. 
Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.

### Summary
The paper presents a scene generation system for complex 3d scenes that prompts an LLM to produce scene descriptions using a scene predicate domain-specific language. Candidate predicates are processed by a 2d layout constraint solver and 3d physics engine to optimize and evaluate the scenes. Feedback from the DSL generation (syntax) and solvers is used to enable the LLM to iterate toward functional scenes with physical properties like asset placement instability.

Experiments test against two prior systems for 3d scene layout and ablations of some of the system components. Evaluations compare whether scenes match prompts, preference comparisons when evaluated by GPT, and the physical distances assets move after initialization (as a physical check). There is also an evaluation of model learning from demonstrations on these scenes.

### Strengths
# originality
The primary novelty is integrating multiple solver types as optimization and feedback mechanisms. This extends prior works and shows how to integrate more parts into generation and LLM guidance.

# quality
Shows some promising results on learning from scene demonstrations.


# clarity
Provides ample qualitative examples of the method to complement quantitative results.


# significance
Will be of interest to the robotic manipulation community.

### Weaknesses
# originality
No single component of the system is particularly novel. And the use of a DSL is more constrained than the more generic code generation of the 3DGeneralist prior work. None of this is horrible, but limits novelty.

# quality
See the questions for detailed remarks and suggestions. The primary concerns are:
- (1) Lack of statistical testing for differences and their magnitudes.
- (2) Need for scaling analysis to get a clearer sense of the cost-benefit trade-off of the new approach.
- (3) Lack of clarity on the demonstration generation and training process. The results are strong, but this is marred by ambiguity on how much the task reflects a particularly strong scenario for PhyScensis compared to previous efforts (the dinner table setting task).

# clarity
See the questions for minor comments. The demonstrations point (3) is related.

### Questions
# questions
- Table 1, 2, 3: Results should include statistical tests for differences and effect sizes. Some of the outcomes look to have overlapping standard deviations, suggesting the differences may not be large.
- Section 4.3: How were demonstrations generated: by humans? an automated process?
	- The section on demonstration generation and training is very compressed and hard to follow. I was not clear on what the demonstrations were, what training was done, and how evaluation was done.
- What costs are involved in each method evaluated (including ablations) and how do they scale?
	- For example: how many LLM queries used, how many iterations / computation (for solvers), how much wall clock time?
	- How do these costs scale with the scene size or number of assets? Other relevant input or output parameters?
- Table 2: Why are the VQA Score, GPT Ranking, Settle Distance not included?
- Is there any evidence around output scene diversity? How that impacts learning the outcomes?
	- It's often desirable that a generator can produce many different outputs from the same prompt, but this can be in tension with controllable outputs.
	- These metrics could be computed from the output scenes themselves, to measure things like number of assets, asset diversity across generations, placement diversity, and so on.


# suggestions / minor comments
- Figure 1: Why does "more compact" look the same?
- How would the dock scenario shown in the figures be used for manipulation?

### Summary
The paper introduces PHYSCENSIS, a framework that automatically generates interactive and physically plausible 3d environments for robotic manipulation. PHYSCENSIS leverages an LLM to propose realistic scene configurations, including spatial relations and object properties. A physics solver then checks if the proposed configuration is feasible and places the objects in the scene. If objects are not solvable, a feedback will be provided to the LLM to refine the scene configuration. Experiments show that PHYSCENSIS outperforms two baselines and that the environments can be used to train an IL policy.

### Strengths
- The paper is very well written, well motivated, and easy to follow
- The methodology, although not entirely novel, is promising.
- The results and ablations show that the individual design choices result in improved generation speed and scene quality.

### Weaknesses
### The main weakness of the paper is the experiments. In particular, the downstream experiment fails to showcase the advantages of the approach compared to existing scene generation pipelines in the robotics domain:
- The VQA-based evaluation is questionable. It’s not clear if this metric works well for complex 3D tabletop environments. The high variance across models suggests it may not be reliable. Comparing it with human judgments could help validate this.
- It’s unclear whether the same VQA model and scores are used both for evaluation and for providing feedback during generation. If so, this would bias results in favor of PHYSCENSIS, since it would directly optimize for the evaluation metric.
- The chosen baselines are rather weak. The authors should explain why they did not compare against similar LLM + physics-based methods (e.g., ClutterGen, RoboGen, SimGen) and elaborate on the choice of baselines further
- The downstream manipulation task is too simple and does not demonstrate the framework’s claimed advantages. The task does not depend on accurate physics or object properties. More challenging tasks like stacking, unstacking, and manipulating objects with different stability would provide stronger evidence.
- The authors state that the cup and plate are fixed for each scene. Is this also the case for the baselines? During evaluation, are the plate and cup also fixed? If yes, the policy would not need to rely on visual cues.


The proposed method is not entirely novel, but it combines existing approaches. However, the problem is very relevant, and the framework could allow for training policies more robust to difficult settings in the pick and place task. However, in its current state, the experiments fail to showcase the effectiveness of the framework in that regard. Thus, in its current state, I tend towards reject. Performing extended robot experiments in more diverse environments and clarifying the evaluation methodology would strengthen the contribution and further support the paper's claims.

### Questions

### Summary
The paper addresses the task of generating physically plausible environments. To tackle challenges in both spatial arrangement and physics, the authors propose the PhyScensis framework, which leverages a large language model (LMM) to generate predicates and employs a physics engine as the physics solver. Their framework also incorporates feedback from the physics engine back to the LMM for further refinement, resulting in realistic layouts and physically stable scenes. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to previous methods.

### Strengths
* The overall system, which integrates LLM-based predicates, a physics-based solver, a geometry-based spatial solver, and feedback to the LLM, is well-designed. This results in layouts that are both reasonable and physically stable.
* Physics-plausible scene generation is an interesting and important direction, particularly for large-scale scene generation.
* The experiments are thorough, including ablations and additional evaluations on downstream robotics tasks.

### Weaknesses
* It is unclear what text prompts are used in the test set for all methods. How many prompts are there, and how diverse are they?
* There is no discussion of failure cases, particularly regarding physics. What are the limitations of the current predefined predicates?
* Regarding the LLM, it is unclear how it determines object sizes and how it selects objects from the candidate object set.

### Questions
* How are objects selected—only at the category level, or is there a more detailed retrieval?
* Are there predefined rules for selection, or is it random? For example, in the “table for 4” case, why are all plates the same? Is this constraint imposed by the LLM?

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework that leverages LLMs and a physics engine to generate physically plausible scenes. Specifically, given a library of 3D assets and a language caption, an LLM is first used to iteratively propose relevant assets and predicates that determine their initial positions. Then, spatial and physics solvers are used to ensure the layout is collision-free and physically plausible. Experiments show that the model achieves good performance compared with previous baselines, especially on scenes with cluttered objects.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and easy to follow.
2. The generation results look good.
3. The proposed method enables a certain level of controllability, such as the distance between objects and the stability of objects.

### Weaknesses
1. I think the term scene generation used here is misleading. The paper mostly focuses on “object arrangement” [1] or “layout generation” [2], where the goal is to place objects of similar sizes on a given surface (e.g., a bookshelf or a table). This is implied by all the qualitative examples. In contrast, scene generation usually refers to generating larger and more complex indoor scenes containing objects of various sizes and more diverse object relationships, which is not demonstrated in the experiments. I agree that the paper tackles a challenging problem involving arranging a large number of objects in confined space, but it is different from the indoor scene generation problem that the baselines address. If the authors want to keep using this term and still treat Architect / 3D-Generalist as the main baselines, they should provide more results on indoor scenes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
2. LayoutVLM [2] is an important missing baseline. This model uses a similar asset library to specify spatial relations between objects. It would be useful to compare these methods. Unlike PhyScenesis, which only leverages an LLM and a physics simulator to avoid collisions, LayoutVLM prompts a VLM to get initial object positions, which may yield more semantically meaningful results.
3. The technical contribution is limited. SceneCraft [3] also proposes an agentic framework that generates 3D scenes using an LLM to generate Blender code with a feedback loop. Spatial and physical predicates are also used in LayoutVLM [2]. The design of the spatial and physics solvers here is largely heuristic and feels ad hoc. They seem specifically designed for cluttered scenes with small objects, which may limit applicability to other scenarios like full indoor scene generation or settings with fewer objects.
4. I appreciate the authors’ effort in building such a complex system to achieve good results. However, it would be better to provide more experiments and details to systematically justify the design choices. See my questions below for more information.

Minor Point:
Line 106: SceneThesis also has a module for optimizing the physical plausibility of generated scenes, including collision avoidance and stability.

I am happy to raise my score if my questions and concerns are addressed.

### Questions
1. Many experimental details are missing:

   a. How many prompts are used in the experiments, and how were they created?  
   b. How many examples were generated per prompt?  
   c. How exactly are the VQA score and GPT-based ranking implemented?

2. From the method description and the prompt in A.3.2, it seems the proposed method does not support placing objects on other objects at a specified height (e.g., a certain shelf level). How is this achieved in Figure 5?

3. The robot experiment is an interesting way to show the diversity of generated scenes from a single prompt:  
   a. Why is the success rate of reaching much higher than that of placing?  
   b. How are the human-designed test scenes different from the generated scenes?  
   c. What do the generated scenes from each model look like? It would be helpful to show sample visualizations to illustrate quality and diversity.

4. What are the failure cases of the model? I am especially interested in scenes with low VQA scores or GPT rankings.
5. It would be helpful to provide qualitative examples of the ablation study between Random, LLM-Only, and the full method. What about using only the spatial solver without the physics solver?
