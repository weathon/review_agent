- Avg Score: 4.67

## Abstract
Artificial Intelligence is increasingly advancing scientific discovery, with chemistry being a key application domain. Synthesis planning, which aims to identify feasible reaction pathways connecting target molecules to available starting materials, is a fundamental task in organic synthesis and drug discovery. Prior work typically relies on backward search, iteratively applying single-step retrosynthesis models, which neglects information from the starting materials and often leads to inefficient exploration and redundant reactions. In this paper, we propose CoBiSyn (Coordinated Bidirectional Synthesis Planning), a framework that alternates between "backward decomposition'' and "forward construction'', while coordinating these two directions through shared frontier information. To support this process, we introduce a conditional embedding projection mechanism and a learned asymmetric synthetic distance, which together provide local and global cost estimates to steer the search. The experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoBiSyn significantly improves the efficiency and  quality for synthesis planning, compared to existing approaches.

### Summary
A bidirectional retrosynthesis framework is introduced that alternates between backward decomposition and forward construction, coordinating both directions via a shared frontier. By synchronizing these searches through common frontier information, the method yields more reliable cost estimates and improves multi-step exploration.

### Strengths
1. A shared frontier tightly couples backward decomposition with forward construction, improving global route consistency and multi-step exploration while avoiding single-direction myopia.

2. A condition-guided embedding projection (without modifying single-step models) plus a dual-embedding synthetic distance that separates intrinsic and condition-dependent costs yields more accurate step/route scoring, enabling better search.

3. The modules are model-agnostic and easy to integrate across reaction domains and single-step backbones.

### Weaknesses
Search Success Rate is a poor indicator of true performance. Your proposed forward module can game SSR, yielding scores that surpass baselines without reflecting chemical validity. This mirrors recent “synthesizable drug design” pipelines that assemble molecules bottom-up using 100+ templates: they often appear successful on paper, but many of the resulting forward reactions are chemically infeasible, revealing metric-driven illusions rather than genuine synthesis.

### Summary
The paper proposes **CoBiSyn**, a coordinated bidirectional synthesis planning framework that jointly expands retrosynthetic and forward frontiers. Each iteration selects a pair of frontier molecules using a learned asymmetric synthetic-distance model and performs conditional single-step expansion in both directions. The method achieves better route success rates and shorter paths than strong baselines on USPTO and Pistachio-style benchmarks. The key technical novelty lies in the conditional projection mechanism that allows an existing single-step model to incorporate contextual information from the opposite frontier.

Overall, the framework is well-engineered and empirically effective. However, the conceptual contribution is **less novel than implied**. The central idea of distance-guided bidirectional search was already established by DESP and Tango, and the paper does not sufficiently acknowledge or compare against these works. The gains mainly stem from refining an existing paradigm rather than introducing a fundamentally new one. 

My score is conditional on the authors addressing the above concern (Weakness).

### Strengths
### Strengths

1. The conditional projection mechanism is a neat and practical idea.  
   It allows an existing single-step retrosynthesis model to condition on information from the opposite frontier without retraining the entire model. This design is lightweight, plug-in friendly, and demonstrates that coordination between forward and backward reasoning can be achieved through minimal architectural changes.

2. Strong empirical performance across benchmarks.  
   The proposed framework achieves higher success rates and shorter routes than previous methods, under comparable rollout budgets. The improvements are consistent across multiple datasets, indicating that the approach is not just theoretically appealing but also practically effective.

### Weaknesses
### Weaknesses

1. Insufficient acknowledgement and comparison to prior bidirectional planners.  
   The paper presents the coordinated bidirectional search as if it were a novel idea, but very similar approaches have already been proposed in DESP and Tango, which also maintain dual frontiers and employ a learned synthetic-distance model to coordinate forward and backward expansions. Therefore, the conceptual contribution is not as new as implied. The paper would be stronger if it explicitly positioned itself as a refinement of these prior bidirectional frameworks and included direct comparisons with them under comparable settings. It should also clarify which components are inherited (two-frontier maintenance, distance-guided frontier pairing) and which part is actually novel here (the conditional projection on the single-step module).

2. Heavy dependence on the learned synthetic-distance model $D_{\theta}$.  
   The selection policy first chooses a backward frontier node and then uses $D_{\theta}$ to match a forward frontier node. This means that once $D_{\theta}$ misranks candidates, the two frontiers may keep expanding along mismatched branches and the search will slow down. The distance itself is trained on automatically constructed molecule pairs from the same datasets (e.g., Pistachio, which contains many short routes), so the paper should discuss how robust the method is to a less accurate distance model, whether the model needs to be retrained for different datasets, and whether an existing distance model such as the one used in DESP could be reused. As it stands, the method introduces a nontrivial prerequisite: a well-trained, task-specific distance network.

3. Forward expansion remains the weak side.  
   The paper also relies on a forward one-step generator to grow routes from the starting-material side, but forward models for synthesis are much less mature than backward single-step models. Conditioning the forward generator on the opposite frontier amplifies this weakness: if the backward frontier happens to contain a suboptimal or noisy node, the forward side is guided toward that noise. The paper does not analyze performance under noisy or low-quality forward frontiers, so the overall stability of the coordinated scheme is unclear.

### Summary
This paper proposes CoBiSyn, a coordinated bidirectional search framework for multi-step chemical synthesis planning that alternates between backward decomposition and forward construction while sharing frontier information through conditional embedding projection and an asymmetric synthetic distance heuristic, achieving higher efficiency and route quality than unidirectional baselines.

### Strengths
* The paper introduces a novel and well-justified bidirectional search paradigm for synthesis planning.

* The framework elegantly coordinates forward and backward reasoning through conditional embeddings and learned distance metrics.

* The proposed method achieves consistent and significant improvements across multiple benchmark datasets and shows strong potential impact for AI-driven drug discovery and materials design.

### Weaknesses
* The paper does not include comparisons with forward-only or hybrid search baselines.

* The proposed method lacks quantitative analysis of computational cost and scalability.

* The performance of CoBiSyn heavily depends on the accuracy of the learned distance model.

* The paper provides limited discussion of the interpretability of the learned representations.

### Questions
* How does the framework determine when to alternate between forward and backward search steps?

* How sensitive is the performance of CoBiSyn to the selection of the asymmetric distance model?

* Can this method be extended to handle these synthesis tasks with multiple targets?

* What is the runtime and memory overhead of CoBiSyn on large molecules?
