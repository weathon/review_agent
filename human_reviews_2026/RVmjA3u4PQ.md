## Abstract
Real-world time series inherently exhibit complex temporal patterns. Within chaotic systems, significant mixing and entanglement occur between different time-varying modes. Given that time series exhibit distinctly different patterns at various sampling scales, downsampling to extract multiscale features is a common approach. However, conventional downsampling causes high-frequency components in the original signal, those exceeding the new Nyquist frequency, to undergo spectral folding. This erroneously introduces spurious low-frequency patterns, perceived as low-frequency noise, thereby leading to the **aliasing problem**. To address this problem, we propose a Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion architecture framework called **DMANet**, which introduces the **D**ynamic **M**ultiscale **A**nti-Aliasing **Net**work. Specifically, DMANet comprises two key components: Multiscale Convolutional Downsampling, designed to capture temporal dependencies and inter-channel interactions, and an Anti-Aliasing Operation, which includes Pre-Sampling Anti-Aliasing Filtering and Post-Sampling Interpolation. These designs guarantee the fidelity of multiscale features before and after downsampling. We show that by mitigating the risk of aliasing, our proposed simple convolutional downsampling architecture achieves performance competitive with common baselines and larger Transformer-based models prevalent in existing studies across multiple benchmark datasets. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DMANet-ED7A.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling complex, multiscale temporal patterns in time series, which are often entangled and can lead to inaccurate predictions if not properly handled. The authors argue that conventional downsampling operations in multiscale convolutional architectures can introduce aliasing, folding high-frequency components into low frequencies and degrading feature quality. To tackle this, they propose a Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion (DMANet) framework, which aims to mitigate aliasing during downsampling and better disentangle time-series features across scales. The method introduces mechanisms for both pre-emptive prevention and post-hoc suppression of aliasing. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show modest performance improvements while maintaining a parameter-efficient design.

### Strengths
1. The paper highlights the often-overlooked issue of spectral aliasing in multiscale downsampling for deep learning–based time series analysis and proposes DMANet to address it, with experiments showing modest performance gains.
2. The architecture follows a clear Decomposition–Prevention–Fusion design, which is easy to understand and implements hierarchical multiscale feature extraction in a systematic way.
3. The experiments cover multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the method’s applicability across different datasets and providing a reasonable parameter-efficient design.

### Weaknesses
1. Unclear problem motivation. The paper mixes up the concept of temporal patterns, which are normal structural features in time series (like trends, cycles, or sudden changes), with aliasing in chaotic systems. It treats the interaction among these patterns as some kind of “noise-like interference,” which is conceptually confusing. In chaotic systems, the complexity mainly comes from deterministic nonlinearity, not random aliasing.
2. Limited novelty. The proposed DMANet architecture mainly relies on standard downsampling and upsampling operations. Using anti-aliasing (low-pass) filters before downsampling is a well-established practice in signal processing, not a new technical contribution. Overall, the design feels more like a reorganization of existing components than a fundamentally new method.
3. Weak performance gains. The improvements over baselines are generally within 1% (e.g. ), which is quite marginal. Moreover, the results don’t include any statistical validation (mean ± variance or multiple runs), making it hard to judge robustness.
4. Uninformative ablation study. The contributions of individual modules are not clearly distinguishable. The ablations do not convincingly show that the proposed design specifically addresses the claimed aliasing issue, so the experiments don’t strongly support the main claim.
5 Inconsistent baselines. It is unclear why the baselines differ across Table 1 and Table 2. Using inconsistent baselines makes it hard to fairly compare the results and assess the method’s effectiveness.

### Questions
1. Could you provide stronger experimental evidence showing that the proposed method actually mitigates prediction errors caused by spectral aliasing? Right now, it is not clear whether the model effectively addresses this issue.
2. Include statistical results (e.g., mean ± variance over multiple runs) to demonstrate the robustness of your reported performance improvement.
3. Provide more convincing evidence that each component of the model contributes meaningfully. The current ablation study does not clearly show how the proposed modules address the claimed aliasing problem.

### Summary
This paper addresses the aliasing problem in multi-scale time series modeling by proposing a dynamic anti-aliasing scheme. The core idea is to apply adaptive low-pass filtering in the frequency domain, while also employing frequency-domain zero-padding during the upsampling stage to ensure signal reconstruction fidelity. Experiments on multiple datasets validate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is clear, and the paper is well-structured, logically progressing from the challenge of aliasing to the proposed method and its experimental validation.
2. The design is simple and effective while also demonstrating good efficiency.
3. The experimental analysis is thorough, with detailed ablations on specific design choices like ESR and the "embedding first" variant.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of Direct Evidence for Anti-Aliasing: The paper's central claim is "reducing aliasing." However, it lacks a quantitative analysis of how much aliasing is caused by existing methods and how much the proposed method reduces it.
2. Incomplete Ablation: The current ablation study fails to disentangle the individual contributions of the anti-aliasing downsampling and the band-limited upsampling modules. To properly attribute the performance gains, the study must be extended to isolate each component's effect. Specifically, it should include comparisons such as: (A). Proposed Downsampling + Traditional Upsampling vs. (B). Traditional Downsampling + Traditional Upsampling. This comparison would quantify the net benefit of the proposed downsampling method alone.

### Questions
1. The ESR derivation seems tightly coupled to your specific DWConv+PWConv architecture. Have you considered whether this anti-aliasing approach can be generalized as a "plug-in" to enhance other downsampling-based models?
2. The model's performance drops sharply without RevIN (w/o RevIN). Does this indicate a strong coupling between RevIN and the proposed anti-aliasing module? If so, what could be the underlying reason?

### Summary
This paper proposes DMANet—a "Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion" architecture—to solve the aliasing problem in multiscale time series forecasting, where conventional downsampling distorts high-frequency components into spurious low-frequency noise. It equips DMANet with Multiscale Convolutional Downsampling (for capturing temporal and inter-channel dependencies) and an Anti-Aliasing Operation (pre-sampling ESR-based filtering and post-sampling frequency-domain interpolation) to preserve feature fidelity. Through experiments on benchmarks like ETT, PEMS, and COVID-19 datasets, the paper shows DMANet achieves state-of-the-art performance in long/short-term forecasting, matching large models while being more parameter-efficient.

### Strengths
1. This study proposes DMANet, a "Decomposition-Prevention-Fusion" architecture, to address aliasing in multiscale time series forecasting—where traditional downsampling distorts high frequencies into spurious low-frequency noise.  
2. It designs ESR-based pre-sampling filtering (dynamic Nyquist frequency calculation) and post-sampling frequency-domain interpolation to preserve feature fidelity, with convolutional downsampling for efficient dependency modeling.  
3. This study validates DMANet on datasets like ETT, PEMS, and COVID-19, showing it achieves SOTA in long/short-term forecasting (matching large models) while being parameter-efficient, with ablations confirming core components’ necessity.

### Weaknesses
1. This study’s labeling of the operation post-embedding as "downsampling" is debatable. Though the operation reduces temporal resolution (via stride-based convolution), it differs from traditional signal processing downsampling— which typically directly reduces sample points of raw signals. Here, the operation acts on embedded latent features (after Linear projection and normalization), blurring the line with "feature dimension reduction" rather than strict signal downsampling, lacking explicit clarification on this conceptual distinction .
2. This study’s heavy reliance on frequency-domain MAE loss raises doubts about its method’s intrinsic effectiveness. Ablation shows removing this loss (using MSE instead) degrades performance significantly (e.g., Unemp dataset MAE rises from 0.146 to 0.166) . This over-dependence suggests the model’s "anti-aliasing advantage" may be overly tied to the loss function, rather than the proposed architecture (like ESR filtering) alone, weakening confidence in the method’s core design merit.

### Summary
This paper identifies that existing downsampling procedures are prone to severe aliasing, and proposes a novel multiscale convolutional downsampling framework DMANet built around a Decomposition–Prevention–Fusion architecture to perform principled downsampling and effectively disentangle time-series features.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces novel mechanisms for preemptive prevention and post-hoc suppression of aliasing, implemented explicitly within the multiscale decomposition process.  
2. DMANet features a parameter-efficient design.  
3. Extensive experiments on both long- and short-term forecasting tasks demonstrate that DMANet achieves competitive performance against strong baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation needs more rigorous substantiation. It would be helpful to include experiments on real or synthetic datasets that (i) empirically verify the aliasing risks claimed in the Introduction and (ii) demonstrate that existing decomposition methods, such as TimeMixer and TimeMixer++, are insufficient to resolve these issues.  
2. As presented through dependency modeling, Figure 4 seems insufficient to demonstrate that the anti-aliasing filter effectively mitigates aliasing.  
3. The efficiency experiments in Table 21 should include additional lightweight baselines (e.g., FilterNet, TimeKAN) and larger-scale datasets (e.g., Traffic, Electricity).  
4. The baselines described in Section 4.1 should have their results presented and analyzed in the main text rather than relegating part of them to the appendix, as this split is confusing.

### Questions
1. Figure 2 requires a more comprehensive and detailed caption to facilitate understanding.
