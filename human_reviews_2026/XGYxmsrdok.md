## Abstract
In autonomous driving, topology reasoning aims to recover the structured connectivity of road networks by detecting map elements and predicting their relations, providing machine-readable maps for safe and efficient operation. Surprisingly, current topology reasoning tasks do not address how to produce better discrete graphs, even though downstream modules such as planning and control rely on them. Existing methods predict continuous edge scores and then apply simple thresholding to obtain discrete graphs, but this step is neither optimized during training nor evaluated in benchmarks. As a result, it remains unclear whether their predicted continuous graphs are truly effective for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose **TopoRefine**, a universal and plug-and-play topology graph refinement module that refines continuous graphs predicted by any topology reasoning model into higher-quality discrete graphs. Specifically, it refines connectivity by learning structural patterns via a lightweight GNN-based refinement module trained in a self-supervised way. This refinement module calibrates predictions so that thresholding yields more reliable discrete structures. In addition, we are the first to introduce a discrete graph evaluation metric in this setting, the Topology Jaccard Score, tailored to directly assess the quality of discrete driving topology graph. Experiments on multiple baselines demonstrate that TopoRefine improves both continuous and discrete graph quality, making it the first framework to explicitly focus on improving discrete graph reliability in topology reasoning.

### Summary
This paper proposes TopoRefine, a plug-and-play refinement module designed to improve the discrete graph quality in driving topology reasoning. The method employs a self-supervised GNN to recalibrate edge confidences predicted by existing topology models and introduces a new evaluation metric, the Topology Jaccard Score (TJS), to measure discrete connectivity. The authors claim that TopoRefine is model-agnostic and can enhance both continuous and discrete topology metrics without retraining. Experiments on the OpenLane-V2 dataset show consistent improvements across multiple baselines.

### Strengths
1. The proposed refinement module is model-agnostic and can be easily applied to existing methods.
2. The experiments show consistent quantitative improvements across various baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The definitions and conceptual differences between continuous graphs and discrete graphs are insufficiently clear, leading to a vague motivation for why this distinction is crucial.

2. The proposed Topology Jaccard Score (TJS) is essentially equivalent to a standard Graph IoU metric and therefore does not provide substantial new conceptual insight. Furthermore, IoU-based measures are inherently sensitive to the threshold used to determine true and false positives; however, the paper lacks any sensitivity analysis or discussion regarding this critical aspect.

3. As described in Sections 3 and 5.2, the framework depends on centerline polylines and traffic element features extracted from strong pretrained backbones such as DINOv2-ViT-L. Consequently, the method functions largely as a post-hoc “plug-and-play” refinement on top of existing lane detection pipelines, introducing additional complexity. Moreover, the integration between this refinement module and existing lane detection or topology reasoning models appears limited, without demonstrating meaningful synergistic effects.

4. Line 301: The paper claims that OpenLane-V2 uses a specific matching formula based on the Hungarian Matching Algorithm, but the corresponding equation seems incorrect and inconsistent with the original OpenLane-V2 implementation.
5. In Table 1, the TOP_ll metric has undergone an update between benchmark versions, yet the paper does not clearly indicate or distinguish which version was used. This lack of clarification casts doubt on the reported performance gains.

6. The evaluation is restricted to OpenLane-V2 Subset A only, with no validation on Subset B.

7. The perturbation strategy in Table 3 yields only marginal performance improvements, suggesting that its contribution to the overall framework may be minimal.

### Summary
This paper proposes a TopoRefine method, a post-training approach that perturbs node features in a discrete graph to introduce noise into its connectivity structure. The model then leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform denoising, thereby enhancing the model’s capability in topology reasoning. In addition, the paper introduces the Topology Jaccard Score (TJS), a new metric designed to quantitatively evaluate the structural quality of discrete graphs.

### Strengths
1. The method features a simple architecture and incurs low training cost.
2. This is a post-training method that requires no modification to the baseline architecture.
3. The method is integrated with multiple models to validate its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. OpenLane-V2 consists of two subsets, Subset A and Subset B, but the paper lacks validation on Subset B.
2. The authors claim that TopoRefine requires only 1.5 hours of training, whereas methods such as SMART take around two days. However, this comparison is unfair because TopoRefine is not trained from scratch. Moreover, existing methods are typically trained on eight GPUs rather than a single one, allowing them to complete training within half a day.
3. The Topology Jaccard Score (TJS) and Topology mAP Score (TOP) both evaluate connectivity reasoning in autonomous driving but from different perspectives. There is no absolute superiority between the two; rather, each captures complementary aspects of topological reasoning. TJS is a discrete, detection-aware metric that measures the overlap between predicted and ground-truth edges, focusing solely on whether topological connections are correct. It is simple, efficient, and interpretable, making it ideal for benchmarking discrete topology reasoning or binary connection prediction. However, TJS overlooks confidence ranking and may not fully reflect the quality of probabilistic predictions. In contrast, TOP, adapted from link prediction in graph learning, assesses how well high-confidence edges correspond to true connections using mean average precision. It captures ranking quality and overall connectivity confidence but is more computationally expensive and sensitive to noisy predictions. In practice, TJS provides a fast and stable measure of structural correctness, while TOP offers a more fine-grained evaluation of model confidence and link reliability.
4. Presenting improvements in percentages is not very intuitive and may come across as overstated.
5. The baseline methods were not originally designed or trained to optimize TJS metric, which explains their weaker performance. Therefore, the large improvement reported on TJS is not entirely convincing. It would be more reliable to demonstrate the improvement through end-to-end (E2E) training that incorporates the TopoRefine method from the beginning.
6. The proposed method involves a large number of hyperparameters, but only partial ablation studies are provided, leaving uncertainty about its sensitivity and generalizability. Moreover, Table 7 evaluates the method on the weakest baseline, whose detection performance is already poor, thereby severely limiting the upper bound of the topology-related metrics.
7. The current method’s topological prediction remains heavily constrained by detection performance. Since TopoRefine is a post-training refinement approach, it inherently inherits the limitations of the underlying detection quality.

### Questions
1. Similar to Topologic, integrate the proposed topological refinement into the end-to-end training pipeline, training the model from scratch to demonstrate improvements in both detection and topology performance.
2. Revise the presentation of improvements by showing the absolute difference from the baseline rather than using percentages.
3. Conduct hyperparameter validation based on the end-to-end training framework.

### Summary
This paper proposes TopoRefine, which addresses the gap between continuous topology prediction, threshold-based discretization, and downstream use in autonomous driving by directly optimizing discrete graph quality. As a post-hoc, plug-and-play module, it operates on the nodes and edges produced by any topology baseline via: (i) self-supervised graph augmentation to construct hard negatives and realistic perturbation distributions; (ii) a lightweight GNN to re-estimate edge existence with relation-aware adaptive weighting; and (iii) fusion/calibration with the baseline scores to yield more reliable discrete connectivity. The paper also introduces the Topology Jaccard Score (TJS), a discrete evaluation metric tailored to connectivity after thresholding. Experiments on an OpenLane-V2 subset across multiple representative baselines show significant improvements on both continuous and discrete metrics, with low overhead and strong generalization.

### Strengths
S1. Centers discrete topology quality as both an optimization target and an evaluation focus, filling a gap in settings dominated by continuous scores (e.g., TOP); proposes TJS as a direct measure of discrete connectivity.

S2. Demonstrates stable gains in a plug-and-play manner with unified weights across diverse baselines, along with comprehensive ablations (loss, perturbation, feature interventions) and efficiency reporting.

S3. Improvements in discrete connectivity directly benefit planning/control/map maintenance downstream.

### Weaknesses
W1. TJS currently depends on detection matching and thresholding, and may be affected by threshold/matching radius choices and baseline score calibration.

W2. Although the method claims to work with limited/no labels, systematic studies on cross-city/sensor/weather/time-of-day transfer and low-label regimes are missing.

W3. The breakdown of inference latency (feature extraction / refinement / GNN message passing / fusion), memory, and throughput scaling with graph size is not sufficiently detailed.

### Questions
Q1. How sensitive are results to the Gaussian perturbation strength and pseudo-node sampling strategy? Do these introduce a domain gap relative to the true prediction-error distribution?

Q2. Under different matching radii and matching strategies (e.g., one-to-many tolerance, maximum-weight matching), does the relative ranking under TJS remain stable?
