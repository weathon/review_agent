- Decision: Accept (Poster)

## Abstract
Learning a human-like driving policy from large-scale driving demonstrations is promising, but the uncertainty and non-deterministic nature of planning make it challenging. Existing learning-based planning methods follow a deterministic paradigm to directly regress the action, failing to cope with the uncertainty problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic planning model for end-to-end autonomous driving, termed VADv2. We resort to a probabilistic field function to model the mapping from the action space to the probabilistic distribution. Since the planning action space is a high-dimensional continuous spatiotemporal space and hard to tackle, we first discretize the planning action space to a large planning vocabulary and then tokenize the planning vocabulary into planning tokens. Planning tokens interact with scene tokens and output the probabilistic distribution of action. Mass driving demonstrations are leveraged to supervise the distribution. VADv2 achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on the CARLA Town05 benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods, and also leads the recent Bench2Drive benchmark. We further provide comprehensive evaluations on NAVSIM and a large-scale 3DGS-based benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/VAD.

### Summary
The paper introduces VADv2, a probabilistic planning model for end-to-end autonomous driving. The model tokenizes planning trajectories into discretize spaces with a vocabulary and output the probabilistic distribution of action.  Distribution loss, conflict loss and scene token loss are used for training. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CARLA Town05, NAVSIM and 3DGS-based benchmark.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of probabilistic planning is clear.
2. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1. The planning vocabulary plays a key role in proposed probabilistic planning. However, there lacks analysis on the quality of the vocabulary to support that the discrete action space formed by the vocubulary can well represent the continuous action space in real world, including qualitative results and statistical analysis.
2. There are already several methods to construct vocubulary for trajectories in autonomous driving, such as K-disks sampling in Trajeglish [1] and uniform quantization in Motionlm [2]. However, there is not any comparation between the proposed planning vocabulary sampling method and existing methods.
3. As mentioned in 2, the idea of predicting trajectories of ego or agents in discrete space with classification loss is not new in autonomous driving. The idea from motion tasks of [1] and [2] is easy to apply to end-to-end planning. Thus, the probabilistic planning lacks significant novelty as the major contribution of the paper.
4. It is better to move the “LLM Usage” paragraph from “Experimental Settings” subsection to appendix.

### Questions
1. How about the performance of VADv2 on middle tasks, including detection, online mapping and motion prediction?
2. Similar to ego planning, the future trajectories of other agents are also of uncertainty. However, the motion prediction of VADv2 is still in continues space with regression loss. Will conducting the task in discrete space improve the perfermance?

### Summary
The paper proposes VADv2, a probabilistic planning model for end-to-end autonomous driving that discretizes the action space into planning tokens to better handle uncertainty. The method achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop results on CARLA Town05 and is further validated on the NAVSIM dataset and a large-scale 3DGS-based benchmark.

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to read.

2. Modeling the uncertainty of trajectory is important.

3. The experiments are conducted on several benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
The main results on CARLA may be outdated; the paper should compare against state-of-the-art methods on more challenging benchmarks such as Bench2Drive [1].

On NAVSIM, the paper does not compare with the latest state-of-the-art algorithms.

Modeling trajectory uncertainty is important; however, there are potentially better approaches such as diffusion models [2,3] or flow matching models [4], which require further comparison and discussion.

### Summary
This paper presents VADv2, an end-to-end vision-based autonomous driving model that introduces a probabilistic planning paradigm to handle uncertainty and non-deterministic behavior in human driving. Instead of regressing deterministic trajectories or control commands, VADv2 models the planning policy as a scene-conditioned stochastic process, predicting a probabilistic distribution over discretized action tokens (“planning vocabulary”). The system tokenizes both the scene (through BEV-based map, agent, traffic, and image tokens) and the action space, learning the probability field of feasible maneuvers via a KL-based distribution loss, conflict regularization, and scene supervision. Most probable trajectory are selected for control during inference, supporting both multi-modal planning and flexible rule-based refinement. Extensive experiments on CARLA Town05, NAVSIM, and a large-scale 3DGS testing showcasing strong performance, particularly improving safety (collision, deviation ratios) and stability in closed-loop tests.

### Strengths
1. VADv2 introduces a well-motivated shift from deterministic to probabilistic planning, effectively addressing multi-modal and uncertain decision spaces, an enduring challenge in end-to-end driving.

2. The model outperforms strong baselines on CARLA, NAVSIM, and 3DGS. The added 3DGS benchmark enhances credibility in real-world-like evaluations.

3. The paper is well-organized and provides detailed architectural and experimental information, including ablations (vocabulary size, data scale, loss components) and insightful qualitative visualizations.

### Weaknesses
The study mainly varies vocabulary size and data scale, but omits analysis of probabilistic vs. deterministic stability across traffic densities, or uncertainty calibration (e.g., entropy of action distribution).

While multi-modal outputs are demonstrated qualitatively, quantitative uncertainty analysis or calibration plots are missing. It is important for safety-critical evaluation.

### Questions
1. How sensitive is performance to the number and diversity of sampled trajectories (vocabulary size N)? Is there a principled way to balance coverage vs. redundancy?

2. Have you evaluated whether the predicted probabilities are well-calibrated (e.g., reliability or ECE curves)? Does confidence correlate with actual driving success?

3. How does stochastic sampling affect stability under closed-loop evaluation?

4. The paper hints at integration between rule-based and learned planning based on probability confidence. How is this threshold determined and implemented in practice (e.g. HSD), and does it improve real-world safety?

### Summary
The paper overall proposes a probabilistic-based end-to-end planner that achieves great results on several benchmarks, including a closed-loop one. The architecture is very similar to VAD, and the highlight is the use of a discrete action space. However, the author should perform a more systematic analysis on the choice of discretization and more informative ablation studies, given the high similarity to VAD. At this point, I tend to accept this paper for its comprehensive comparison with other methods and performance but I may change my rate based on the author's responses.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes a probabilistic-based end-to-end planner by using a discretized action space, which is neat.
2. The writing is clear and easy to follow with illustrations.
3. The performance is great and the comparison with other works is fair and solid with closed-loop validation.

### Weaknesses
1. I believe most of the performance gain comes from the use of discretized action vocabulary, the author uses furthest trajectory sampling to get the vocabulary. I'm wondering if the noise of the vocabulary can affect the result? If yes, then to what extent? I would like to see more experiments on that. Also, the pre-defined vocabulary can be seen as a prior, and it can be different across datasets. I want to know the zero-shot cross-dataset performance of your method.
2. Since the vocabulary is very important, I would like to see more discussion on different ways of discretization, and its discretization error, a discussion on how this error would affect the performance would make your work more comprehensive.
3. In terms of the loss function, since you have discretized the whole action space, why use cross-entropy instead of the KL-divergence?
4. The ablation study on Tab. 4 is really hard to give useful information. For example, I want to know whether the conflict loss is useful; I can't find the exact setting that only w/ or w/o this loss. I strongly suggest the author make this up during the rebuttal. 
5. Visualize the discretized action vocabulary will make the reader better understand the ideology.
