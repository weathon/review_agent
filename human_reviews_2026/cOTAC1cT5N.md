## Abstract
Time series forecasting is essential for predicting temporal dynamics across diverse domains, from meteorological patterns to urban traffic flows.
Many such time series exhibit strong periodic patterns, like weekly traffic cycles, and leveraging this periodicity is crucial for forecasting accuracy.
However, existing approaches typically rely on autoregressive models ($x_{t+1} = f(x_t, x_{t-1}, \dots)$) to capture these patterns implicitly or incorporate specialized modules and timestamp embeddings as auxiliary inputs explicitly.
In this work, we propose PAPer: Periodicity Alignment for Periodic Time Series and demonstrate that an explicit yet simple alignment of periodic patterns without auxiliary inputs yields substantial improvements.
We validate PAPer through mathematical proofs, illustrative toy examples, and extensive real-world experiments.
Our results show that PAPer, when applied to state-of-the-art models, achieves performance gains of up to 7\% on multiple benchmarks.
Moreover, PAPer is model-agnostic and can reduce model complexity by up to 99.5\% while incurring only a minor 11\% performance trade-off.
This work presents a foundational investigation into periodicity alignment, and the code is available at xxx.

### Summary
The paper introduces PAPER (Periodicity Alignment for Periodic Time Series) — a simple yet effective framework that explicitly aligns periodic patterns in time series forecasting without relying on auxiliary inputs such as timestamps or positional embeddings. The method detects the fundamental period through a forecasting-based criterion and reorganizes samples so that each position in the input corresponds to the same phase within a cycle. The authors provide theoretical analyses, proofs, and extensive experiments demonstrating improved performance and reduced model complexity.

### Strengths
1. Novel yet simple concept – The idea of periodic alignment as a preprocessing step is conceptually intuitive but underexplored. It effectively bridges autoregressive and non-autoregressive formulations in periodic data.  
2. Comprehensive experiments – Results across multiple real-world benchmarks (Electricity, Solar, Traffic) show consistent performance improvements (up to 7%), confirming the method’s efficacy.

### Weaknesses
1. Overfitting and sensitivity – As shown in Theorem 4.2 and Figure 8a, the method can overfit when distribution drift occurs, especially in nonstationary environments.
2. Assumption of fixed periodicity – The method relies on detecting a single fundamental period, limiting its applicability to datasets with multiple or evolving cycles.
3. Comparative baseline scope – While CycleNet is included, other modern baselines that capture temporal periodicity in the frequency domain (e.g., FEDformer, TimeMixer) are not considered.
4. Limited benefit for short horizons – PAPER’s advantage appears only when the forecast horizon exceeds one period; for short-term tasks, it may degrade performance (Figure 8b).

### Questions
1. The proposed method assumes a single dominant period \(P^*\). How would PAPER handle real-world time series that exhibit **multiple overlapping or time-varying periodicities** (e.g., daily and weekly cycles, or drifting seasonal patterns)? Could the alignment process be extended to dynamically detect or adapt to multiple periodic components?

2.  The paper mentions that PAPER’s advantage diminishes under distributional shift. Have you explored mechanisms such as **online re-estimation of the period**, **adaptive alignment windows**, or **incremental re-training** to improve robustness? Quantitatively, how frequently would re-alignment be required in a non-stationary environment?

### Summary
This paper introduces PAPER (Periodicity Alignment on Periodic time series), a model-agnostic preprocessing method designed to improve forecasting performance on time series with strong periodicity. The core idea is to align all input sequences so that they begin at the same phase within a given period, padding with zeros where necessary. 

The authors claim this explicit alignment helps models learn non-autoregressive dependencies and improves performance. The paper tries to support this claim with theoretical analysis, synthetic experiments, and results on several real-world datasets. Experimental results show that PAPER can enhance the performance of one existing model, SFNN, on three real-world datasets.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a straightforward and simple-to-implement plug-in method for handling periodic time series. The idea of aligning data to a common periodic phase is intuitive and can be beneficial to all time series analysis tasks. 

The authors make efforts to validate their method from multiple perspectives, including theoretical proofs (Section 4.2 and Appendix A), controlled synthetic experiments (Section 4.3 and 4.4), and experiments on real-world benchmarks (Section 5).

### Weaknesses
1. The core idea of aligning data based on a period is a form of explicit feature engineering. However, the paper fails to discuss or compare its method against other well-established techniques that achieve similar goals, such as adding periodic positional encodings (e.g., Fourier features, time-of-week embeddings). These alternative methods can also explicitly inform the model about the periodic phase without the disruptive re-ordering and zero-padding of the input sequence.
2. The experiments are not solid enough to support the paper's claims:
   1. Limited Baselines: The experiments primarily compare against only one method (CycleNet). A stronger evaluation would require comparison against a wider range of methods that explicitly model periodicity, especially those using positional or temporal embeddings.
   2. Choice of Backbone Model: The choice of SFNN as the main backbone model is questionable. While the authors state it is a state-of-the-art model, it is not yet a widely recognized or established benchmark model in the community. Demonstrating improvements on more models (e.g., DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST) would be more convincing.
   3. Insufficient Datasets: The evaluation is conducted on only three real-world datasets. Given the method's strong reliance on periodicity, its performance on a more diverse set of benchmarks, including those with varying degrees of periodicity, is needed.
   4. Unconventional Data Splitting: The paper uses a 95%-5% train-test split without a validation set, arguing that this reflects real-world practice. However, this is a departure from standard practice in academic literature, making results difficult to compare with prior work.
3. The choice to pad missing values with zeros in Section 3.2.1 is not well-justified. Zero-padding can introduce significant noise and create artificial discontinuities, especially for time series whose values are not centered around zero. The paper does not analyze the impact of this choice or explore more principled alternatives (e.g., padding with a mean value or a learned padding value)
4. The paper's overall presentation is a weakness, making it difficult for the reader to follow the core argument. The motivation is not clearly articulated in the Introduction section; it fails to convincingly explain why this specific alignment approach is necessary compared to existing methods for handling periodicity.
5. There are some unaddressed limitations and unrealistic assumptions:
   1. The paper's analysis and experiments are confined to time series with strong, stable periodicity. The method's behavior on data with weak, multiple, or evolving periods is not discussed, which severely limits its practical applicability.
   2. The theoretical analysis in Section 4.2 relies on strong assumptions (e.g., linear model, L=H=P, a specific autoregressive data-generating process) that may not hold for complex, real-world time series and deep learning models. The conclusions from this analysis (e.g., Theorem 4.2 stating that alignment increases testing error) seem to contradict the paper's main claims, and the subsequent "rescue" in the non-autoregressive case (Section 4.4) feels post-hoc and is based on a constructed toy example.

### Questions
1. How does the proposed alignment method (PAPER) compare, both in performance and computational overhead, to simply adding periodic positional features (e.g., Fourier features, or one-hot encodings for the phase t mod P) to the input of a standard model? This seems like a crucial and missing baseline.

2. Why was SFNN chosen as the primary base model over more widely adopted models in the time series community (e.g. DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST)? The claim of being "model-agnostic" would be much stronger if tested on a more diverse and established set of architectures in the main results table. Besides, instead of presenting the results of three other base models for a specific dataset (as in Figure 5), I suggest using a single, comprehensive table. This table should show the performance of every base model (with and without PAPER) on every dataset, which would allow for a much clearer and more direct comparison.

3. Could you provide a justification for using zero-padding in Section 3.2.1? Have you experimented with other padding strategies (e.g., mean-padding, replication-padding, or using a learnable padding embedding) and analyzed how they affect the model's performance? Padding with zero seems likely to introduce distribution shift.

4. The assumptions in Section 4.2 are quite restrictive. In particular, Theorem 4.2 suggests that alignment increases test error under an autoregressive DGP. Given that many real-world time series can be well-approximated by autoregressive models, doesn't this theoretical result significantly weaken the case for your method? The non-autoregressive example in 4.4 feels contrived; can you provide evidence from real-world data that it truly operates in this non-autoregressive regime?

5. The proposed period detection method's robustness is not thoroughly evaluated. The accuracy of P is critical to the entire method. How robust is the proposed periodicity detection method?  How does it perform in the presence of noise, trends, or multiple overlapping periodicities? What happens if it detects a slightly incorrect period? How does this error in P propagate and affect the final forecasting accuracy?

### Summary
The paper introduces PAPER (Periodicity Alignment), a framework that explicitly leverages periodic structures in long time-series prediction by first detecting periodicity and then aligning sequences accordingly. The method integrates easily into various backbone models and demonstrates improvements on several benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. The paper combines theory and empirical validation.
2. The experimental coverage is broad, spanning multiple datasets and model families, showing the generality of the approach.
3. The method performs well under model compression or low-rank settings, showing robustness to parameter constraints.

### Weaknesses
1. The robustness of the periodicity detection module is insufficiently analyzed. Its behavior under noise, multi-periodicity, or irregular cycles remains unclear.
2. The approach is sensitive to distribution shifts, yet the paper does not provide strategies to mitigate this limitation.
3. Comparisons with existing explicit periodic modeling methods lack depth. Implementation details and hyperparameter fairness are not fully discussed.
4. Some theoretical results rely on restrictive assumptions, and their applicability to real-world data-generating processes is not well justified.
