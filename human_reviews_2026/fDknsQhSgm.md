## Abstract
Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. 
While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings.
In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

### Summary
This paper proposes exPreCast, an efficient deterministic deep learning framework for short-term precipitation (nowcasting), focusing on extreme rainfall events. exPreCast is built upon the Video Swin Transformer and introduces a Cubic Dual Upsample (CDU) decoder to preserve fine radar texture and a Temporal Extractor (TE) for flexible forecasting horizons and dynamic adjustment. The authors also construct a balanced and extensive radar dataset (from the Korea Meteorological Administration, KMA) to complement existing imbalanced benchmarks like SEVIR and MeteoNet. Experiments across all three datasets show that exPreCast achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance with far less computational cost, making it feasible for real-time applications. Ablation studies further support the efficacy of the proposed modules, especially the CDU. The paper also discusses limitations and potential future directions.

### Strengths
The paper cleverly integrates efficient CDU and TE modules, significantly improving precipitation nowcasting accuracy and generalizability for both extreme and normal regimes, while maintaining low computational cost—making it highly practical for real-world use.

### Weaknesses
While there is an ablation comparison of upsampling methods, there is no systematic ablation of other core modules—such as the backbone transformer, TE module, or skip connection. The contributions of each component if removed or replaced are not separately quantified, making it hard to attribute performance gains.

Although the KMA dataset is introduced as intermediately balanced, details about its collection, labeling standards, preprocessing, and physical data quality are thin. There is also little about public release or ensuring its fairness and community usability.

### Questions
Could the authors present ablation results for the TE, backbone transformer, skip connections etc., and analyze how removing each affects performance and failure patterns?

Can the authors clarify the details of KMA data collection, labeling, preprocessing, and release? What measures ensure its broad representativeness and high physical credibility?

### Summary
The proposed model exPreCast is a Transformer-based deterministic precipitation nowcasting model that integrates local spatiotemporal attention, texture-preserving CDU decoder and TE block to flexibly adjust forecast lead times, which also constructs a balanced KMA dataset containing ordinary and extreme precipitation. Experiments on KMA, SEVIR and MeteoNet show exPreCast’s  outperform baselines like ConvLSTM and SimVP.

### Strengths
1. ExPreCast constructs a balanced KMA dataset containing both ordinary and extreme precipitation, addressing the imbalance of existing datasets, and providing more comprehensive data support for evaluating model generalization. 
2. ExPreCast integrates the CDU decoder and TE block, enabling the model to perform well in both 1-hour short-term and 6-hour long-term forecasts.

### Weaknesses
1. This work lacks a comparison with GAN-based methods, and adding such a comparison can provide a more complete assessment of exPreCast’s performance. 
2. This work would be better to include verification related to the impact of the TE block in the ablation study section to quantify the effect of the TE block on balancing the detail preservation of short-term forecasts and the dynamic stability of long-term forecasts.
3. Relying on CSI as an indicator may not fully judge the quality of precipitation predictions. The average intensity of precipitation predictions will significantly affect CSI. The authors can consider adding the scores which aims to assess how closely the nowcasting outputs.

### Questions
The questions here are related to the three points described as weaknesses.

### Summary
The paper describes a deterministic method for generating radar forecasts. It also proposes a novel dataset, which is based on the data from Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and contains a balanced selection of meteorological events, which is aimed at reducing the bias towards either ordinary or extreme events. The choice of KMA data is due to the wide range of meteorological events: the country has intense rainfall in summer via monsoons and typhoons, and lighter precipitation in other seasons.

### Strengths
Originality: 
- the contributions include both the dataset and the method for precipitation forecasting aimed specifically at enhancing extreme events nowcasting. The main methodological contribution includes the upsampling described in Section 3.2

Quality: 
- Good performance: the experimental results (Table 1-3) show consistently good performance.  

Clarity:  
- the description of the work looks clear and easy to follow, and I believe the description is correct. 

Significance:
- while the operational and novel deep-learning models cope reasonably well with the ordinary precipitation, the extreme precipitation is an important unsolved problem. 
- availability of the big benchmarking dataset is an important asset for the research in the area, which also contributes towards the significance of this work.

### Weaknesses
Significance and originality:
- I can see there are two important points which are in advantage for the significance of the paper: (1) proposition of the Cubic Dual Upsample Block (2) dataset. Saying that, however, while the Cubic Dual Upsample Block is justified empirically in the ablation studies, it does not justify why it happens. Perhaps, one could create a link in the appendix, offering the analysis why this might lead to the improvements (if it follows from the existing literature such as Fan et al that would be also totally fine, however the justification needs to be there). This could be a theoretical justification or some additional empirical analysis which would help answer not only whether it helps but also what makes it work better. On point (2), the dataset, I would expect the authors to say whether it would be released (after careful reading I couldn't see it clearly), and put some descriptions about how this dataset is created. Now, I can only see in Appendix A that 'we first converted the radar reflectivity from dBZ to mm/h using the Marshall-Palmer Z-R relationship, Z = 200R1.6. We then report the CSI-p for thresholds p= [1,4,8,10,20,40,80]. Additionally, we applied a mask to exclude pixels outside the radar range' Maybe, comparing these statistics with the statistics of the existing datasets would be useful and would better justify this part of the contribution. 

I would expect the authors also to put a list of contributions in the end of the intro, that would help navigate through the methodology.

### Summary
This paper introduces exPreCast, a deterministic deep learning framework for extreme weather nowcasting using radar-based precipitation data.
The authors aim to address challenges in forecasting localized and fine-scale rainfall patterns, especially under extreme conditions, where existing diffusion-based generative models are accurate but computationally heavy, and deterministic ones are efficient but biased toward normal rainfall. exPreCast builds on a Video Swin Transformer backbone and incorporates two key modules: Cubic Dual Upsampling (CDU) and Temporal Extractor (TE). The authors also construct a new balanced radar dataset, KMA, covering both normal and extreme precipitation events in South Korea (2014–2023). Extensive ablation studies and long-term prediction results further validate the model’s robustness and efficiency.

### Strengths
Balanced new dataset: The introduction of the KMA dataset provides a valuable contribution for evaluating generalization across both normal and extreme rainfall conditions.

Strong empirical performance: exPreCast achieves SOTA results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating robustness under diverse meteorological regimes.

Comprehensive experimentation: The paper includes rigorous comparisons, ablations, and qualitative visualizations that convincingly support the claims.

### Weaknesses
Lack of Discussion on FACL:
The authors employ FACL in their model but provide no related discussion. FACL contributes significantly to texture generation and substantial forecast improvements[1]. For fairness, the authors should present a comparison between other models (e.g., SIMVP) with FACL and the proposed exPreCast, or alternatively, compare the performance of exPreCast trained with MSE loss against other models.

Unfair Comparison Due to FACL in Different Forecast Durations:
Although the authors claim that the CDU decoder can adapt to various forecast lengths, the use of FACL still makes comparisons across different forecast durations unfair. It becomes difficult to distinguish whether the performance gain for long-term forecasting comes from FACL or from the CDU decoder itself.

Lack of Discussion on the Distribution of Precipitation Events Across Datasets:
Lines 18–21 state that previous datasets are limited to a single type of precipitation event, whereas KMA balances different precipitation types. However, this claim lacks statistical support. The authors should analyze and compare the distribution of precipitation events at different thresholds across datasets.

Incomplete Ablation Study on Upsampling:
The ablation on upsampling is only conducted on exPreCast, which is insufficient to demonstrate that upsampling is a general issue across all deterministic models. Moreover, the range of interpolation methods compared is limited—commonly used methods such as bicubic and area interpolation are missing. Exploring multiple interpolation approaches across different models would yield more valuable insights.

Incomplete Visualization in Figure 6:
Figure 6 should include all forecast frames from one hour to six hours after the first frame. Providing the complete sequence would allow reviewers to better evaluate the visual quality and temporal consistency of the generated forecasts.
