# A Causal Perspective on Jump-Diffusion for Time-Series Anomaly Detection

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
Time series anomaly detection is essential for maintaining robustness in dynamic real-world systems. However, most existing methods rely on static distribution assumptions, while overlooking the latent causal structures and structural shifts that underlie real-world temporal dynamics. This often leads to poor explanation of anomalies and misclassification of environment-induced variations. To address these shortcomings, we propose Causal Soft Jump Diffusion Anomaly Detection (CSJD-AD), a novel framework that models both latent dynamics and soft-gated expected jumps through a structural jump diffusion process. We adopt a causal perspective grounded in environment-conditioned invariance by inferring discrete environment states and condition both the dynamics and jump intensity on them, so the model learns which changes are expected under each regime. By generating paired “expected” (counterfactual) and “observed” (factual) trajectories, the model explicitly contrasts causally consistent behavior with unexplained deviations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmark datasets, demonstrating the importance of incorporating causal reasoning and jump-aware dynamics into time series anomaly detection.

### Summary
The paper introduces a causal jump-diffusion framework for time series anomaly detection. The approach combines a variational encoder that infers latent dynamics $U$ and discrete environment codes $E$ (via Gumbel–Softmax) with a differentiable stochastic process that includes both continuous drift–diffusion evolution and soft discrete jumps. Each environment defines its own drift, diffusion, and jump parameters, enabling the model to capture regime-dependent behaviors. During training, the model simulates a counterfactual path using drift–diffusion only and a factual path with the soft-jump term, blends them through a factor $\gamma$, and reconstructs the observation through a decoder. A causal contrastive loss regularizes the distance between factual and counterfactual paths weighted by the jump magnitude and gate, while KL and entropy regularizers constrain latent distributions. Experiments on seven standard benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization under noise and missing-value perturbations.

### Strengths
- The methodology is well motivated and clearly defined.

- The introduction of a soft jump gate to replace non-differentiable Poisson jumps is clever and novel, allowing end-to-end learning while preserving the causal intuition of jumps.  

- The mathematical formulation and derivations are coherent, and the causal discrepancy weighting is both principled and interpretable.  

- Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each module (drift, diffusion, jump, gate, and counterfactual contrast), showing their collective impact on robustness.
  
- The work is reproducible: all implementation details, training configurations, and code structure are clearly explained and publicly available.

### Weaknesses
- The introduction assumes substantial prior familiarity with stochastic calculus and causal inference (e.g., lines 68–71), using unnecessarily dense phrasing. Both the abstract and introduction could better motivate the core idea in more accessible terms before diving deeper in the rest of the paper.

- Some hyperparameters are fixed per dataset, but this is an unsupervised setting with no validation data. Selecting per-dataset values introduces potential bias; a single shared configuration across datasets would ensure fairer evaluation.  

- The connection to diffusion-based reconstruction models could be clarified. The authors should better distinguish their method’s causal mechanism from diffusion reconstruction or generative modeling approaches, which might appear similar in structure.

**Minor comments**

- All citations should be in parentheses using ***\citep***.

- Line 267: add a space between “Equation” and “(6)” and make it a clickable reference. 
 
- Line 211: the equation could be swapped to an equivalent and clearer expression $U_{\text{final}} = U_{CF} + \gamma p_E J_E$, emphasizing better that $\gamma$ controls jump influence.  

- Explicitly write the L2 norm $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2^2$ in $\mathcal{L}{\text{recon}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}$ (use $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ instead of $|\cdot|$ for vector-valued quantities).

### Questions
- How can you explain that adding small noise levels improved performance as shown in Table 5?

- How were hyperparameters chosen for each dataset in an unsupervised setting?

### Summary
This paper presents CSJD-AD (Causal Soft Jump Diffusion for Anomaly Detection), a novel framework for time-series anomaly detection that integrates causal reasoning with stochastic jump-diffusion dynamics. The model infers latent environment variables to capture invariant temporal structures and introduces a soft-gated jump mechanism to model abrupt changes in a differentiable way. By generating paired factual and counterfactual trajectories, it separates genuine anomalies from environment-induced variations. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance and strong robustness to noise and missing data.

### Strengths
+ Well-motivated causal formulation. The paper provides a clear causal perspective on time-series anomaly detection, emphasizing the distinction between environment-induced variations and true anomalies.  This addresses a long-standing limitation of conventional reconstruction- or prediction-based methods.

+ Innovative integration of jump-diffusion and causal reasoning. The proposed soft-gated jump-diffusion SDE combines continuous dynamics and discrete abrupt changes within a unified differentiable process.  This formulation allows the model to capture both smooth and sudden temporal behaviors, a feature rarely seen in TSAD research.

+ Counterfactual learning design. By jointly learning factual and counterfactual latent trajectories, the model effectively enforces invariance to environmental changes and enhances anomaly discrimination.  This idea is conceptually elegant and well-grounded in causal inference principles.

+ Strong theoretical and methodological grounding. The paper provides existence and convergence proofs for the proposed stochastic process and discusses the discretization stability of the SDE formulation, which adds significant rigor compared to purely empirical works.

### Weaknesses
+ Limited discussion on computational efficiency. Although the model integrates causal reasoning with jump-diffusion dynamics, it requires solving stochastic differential equations with gating and counterfactual reconstruction, which may be computationally expensive.    The paper lacks analysis of scalability to long sequences or large datasets.

+ Ablation and sensitivity analysis remain shallow. The ablations only evaluate component removal. There is no deeper examination of how causal losses, jump gates, or hyperparameters influence detection sensitivity or stability.

### Questions
+ Since the method requires solving stochastic differential equations with both diffusion and jump components, what is the computational overhead compared to simpler transformer- or VAE-based baselines? Could the authors provide runtime or FLOPs analysis for different sequence lengths?

+ Can the authors visualize or qualitatively analyze what the inferred $E_t$ represents?
Does it align with real environment or regime shifts (e.g., seasonal, operational, or contextual changes), or does it act as a latent clustering factor without clear semantics?

+ The number of environments $K$ is manually fixed per dataset. How sensitive is the model performance to this choice?
Have you explored data-driven or non-parametric approaches to infer $K$ automatically?

### Summary
This paper proposes Causal Soft Jump Diffusion Anomaly Detection (CSJD-AD) method to improve time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) by addressing the challenge of handling environment-driven distribution shifts and causal structures. The proposed method emphasizes a causal model, explicitly considering latent environments that influence the normal behavior of time-series data. CSJD-AD utilizes a soft-gated jump-diffusion process, where the jumps are modulated by a learned environment state. And it employs a causal contrastive loss that focuses on learning the environment-specific dynamics, improving sensitivity to anomalies while keeping the model robust to structural changes across different regimes.

### Strengths
1) The integration of causal reasoning into TSAD is a major contribution, as it addresses environmental regime shifts, which are common in real-world data.

2) The soft-gated jump-diffusion model adds expressiveness and flexibility while maintaining a differentiable framework. It is a interesting approach to model abrupt transitions that traditional methods might miss.

3) CSJD-AD demonstrates superior performance in multiple benchmarks, especially in scenarios with severe class imbalance.

### Weaknesses
1) The idea of introducing a discrete environment variable to represent latent causal regimes is intuitive. However, in highly dynamic environments or domains with continuous, gradual shifts, discretizing the environment into a limited number of regimes might oversimplify the problem. The piecewise-constant assumption that the environment only shifts at specific intervals might not be valid for those with noisy or rapidly changing conditions.

2) Since subtle anomalies and gradual shifts do not exhibit discrete jumps, I wonder if the proposed jump-diffusion model that treats anomalies as gated jumps would still remain effective in this case.

3) Although the counterfactual vs factual approach is intuitive, this causal contrastive loss might become difficult to train in some real-world applications with noisy or incomplete data. Further research is needed to refine the causal inference component to make it more robust in practical scenarios.

4) While the model shows great results, the evaluation relies heavily on window size tuning. Some datasets (e.g., SMD) benefit from explicit environmental modeling, while others may not. A more systematic analysis of how window size affects performance and a broader study on hyperparameter sensitivity would be valuable.

5) The discussion and analysis of diffusion-based TSAD methods is not comprehensive enough, and a comprehensive review of relevant papers in this field is needed.

### Questions
1) The approach relies on learning an environment variable, but it's unclear how the model would perform in unsupervised environments where such environmental labeling is not available or is uncertain.

2) See weakness.

### Summary
This paper introduces CSJD-AD, a time-series anomaly detection framework using environment-conditioned jump-diffusion processes. The method infers discrete environment states $E$ unsupervised and conditions drift, diffusion, and soft-gated jumps on them. It generates dual trajectories—counterfactual $U_{CF}$ (expected evolution) and factual $U_F$ (with jumps)—to distinguish regime shifts from anomalies via causal contrastive loss. The differentiable soft-gating mechanism $p_E J_E$ replaces traditional Poisson jumps. CSJD-AD achieves state-of-the-art results across seven benchmarks, with notable improvements on imbalanced datasets (e.g., AUCPR 0.937 vs. 0.691 on Yahoo), demonstrating the value of environment-aware modeling.

### Strengths
- Novel integration of causal reasoning principles with jump-diffusion dynamics for anomaly detection
- Soft-gating mechanism ($p_E$) provides a differentiable alternative to traditional Poisson jumps
- Dual-path generation (counterfactual/factual) offers interpretable separation of regime-consistent vs. anomalous behavior
- Rigorous experimental design with seven diverse benchmarks and proper statistical reporting
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate each component's contribution (Table 3)
- Environment manipulation experiments (Table 4) confirm that learned $E$ meaningfully affects detection

### Weaknesses
- The paper claims a "causal perspective" but doesn't validate whether discovered environments $E$ correspond to true causal regimes. UMAP clustering (Figure 2) shows separation but not causal meaning. It's more valuable if authors can provide case studies on datasets with known operational modes (e.g., WADI has documented attack scenarios) to validate $E$ alignment with ground-truth regimes.
- The term "counterfactual" is misused. $U_{CF}$ represents expected evolution under the observed environment, not under a counterfactual intervention $do(E=e')$.
- No principled method for choosing $K$ (number of environments). Table 8 shows $K \in {2,4}$ but no sensitivity analysis.
- Section 3.3.1 claims one soft jump per window approximates cumulative Poisson effects but provides minimal justification.
- Section 3.6 briefly mentions using $L_{total}$ as anomaly score but lacks detail on threshold selection and online deployment.

### Questions
1. Can you provide evidence that learned $E$ corresponds to meaningful operational regimes? For WADI (a water distribution testbed with documented attack scenarios), do environment switches align with known events?
2. How would your framework handle true counterfactual queries like "would this observation be anomalous under environment $e'$?" Does the current formulation support such queries?
3. How sensitive is performance to the "one jump per window" assumption? Have you experimented with multiple jumps or continuous jump rates?
4. Why not use a Bayesian nonparametric prior (e.g., Dirichlet Process) to infer $K$ automatically as mentioned in future work? What prevents this in the current framework?
