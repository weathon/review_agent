## Abstract
A resource-constrained decision maker (DM) designs a continuous-time sequential experiment to determine the best choice out of a set of treatments. The DM divides her attention between observing the treatments until one of the resources runs out. Under the minimax regret criterion, we characterize the optimal policy for two treatments when there is a fixed array of resources. Of additional interest is a prerequisite result in which we characterize the minimax regret optimal policy under a single infinite resource (money) and adaptive stopping. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the typical optimal stopping problem in which we model diffusions with respect to the cumulative resource expenditure rather than the elapsed time.

### Summary
This paper studies how a resource-constrained decision maker should optimally design continuous-time sequential experiments to identify the best arm in the best-arm identification with knapsack constraints (BAIwK) problem, where arms deplete resources unevenly under a minimax regret criterion. The authors first characterize the optimal policy for a Wald-type problem with a single, effectively infinite resource, then leverage this to derive optimal sampling strategies for fixed-budget BAIwK with multiple resource constraints. A key result is that, by modeling diffusion in terms of cumulative resource expenditure (rather than instantaneous consumption), the minimax-optimal policy in continuous time is a history-independent fixed strategy.

### Strengths
This paper derives the minimax decision rules of the generalized Wald problem to a sequential experiment with heterogeneous costs. The proposed algorithm is practical for settings in which resource costs vary across treatments.

### Weaknesses
- Key contribution in unclear.
- The page limit is nine pages, so there is still room. Numerical experiments can be included.
- For Theorem 1, Corollary 1, and Theorem 2, neither the intuitive understanding nor the insights derived from them are discussed.

### Questions
- What is the key contribution of this paper?
- Can numerical experiments be included?
- Can you provide some intuitive understanding or insights derived fromt the theorems?
- In the abstract, the authors say "continuous-time sequential experiment", what is this?

### Summary
This work studies the best arm identification problem where each arm is coupled with heterogenous cost with continuous time instead of the discrete rounds to account for expenditure for the resources. The paper sets up with Walds problem with only two treatments, 1 resource to establish the notion of Minimax regret and establishes that the optimal policy is a fixed cost weighted sampling rule in this regime. Then the authors extend the analysis for the case treatment case of 2 with several resources and shows that a similar fixed allocation still holds for fixed budget setting.

### Strengths
This works studies BAI with heterogeneous cost and provide a minimax formulation to handle this which was not studied in the literature. 

The work also extends to multiple resource constraints without losing simplicity: the optimal policy is still history-independent. 

Also, the policy shown in this work is interpretable, they get a closed-form sampling rule in continuous time and it is not common in BwK (Bandits with Knapsack) literature. 

The work is well presented and from the same setup they established they get  the sequential problem with a stopping boundary and fixed expenditure BAI as a corollary to see how the policy changes when you can’t stop early.

### Weaknesses
The work only focus on the setting with only two arms and their notion of minimax is for 2 treatment. This is an important constraint with respect to the scope of work and its application. 

There is a strong assumption of known cost and deterministic consumption of resources, basically arm variances and resource usage is assumed to be known which is almost not possible in many practical situation.

Strong assumption with respect to the resource consumption in the case of multiple resource case. This undermines the concept of multiple resources. 

The work also doesn't provide any simulation or experimentational results to back the main theoretical results of the paper and having them would have complemented their result with respect to decision theory

### Questions
In the case of multiple resources - two arm case, if the resources are consumed in the same proportion as their respective global budget, does that not reduce the problem into a single global budget with each arm having a proportional consumption of the main resources ?

What happens if the resource consumption are stochastic, which is often the case. Also, can the reward and cost associated with a arm be dependent on each other ?

A lot of practical scenarios deals with random costs/ consumption associated with arms and optimal actions are learned through exploration on the constraints too. How does the problem setting deal in this scenario ? 

Since, the variances are unknown and must be learned which happens to the case in trials, does having an initial exploration phase break the history independence shown in the paper ? Also how much does it contribute to the minimax regret

### Summary
This paper studies a resource-constrained version of the Bayesian Best-Arm Identification (BAI) problem, termed Best-Arm Identification with Knapsacks (BAIwK). The decision maker must identify the best treatment while managing multiple resources that are heterogeneously consumed by each arm. The authors work in a continuous-time, minimax regret framework and characterize optimal policies for both (i) single-resource (Wald-type) problems with adaptive stopping and (ii) multi-resource (knapsack) problems with fixed budgets.
The key methodological contribution is a reformulation of information acquisition as a function of cumulative resource expenditure rather than elapsed time. This change of variables yields closed-form expressions for minimax-optimal sampling strategies and stopping rules. The main results (Theorem 1 and 2) show that the optimal allocation is history-independent, corresponding to a generalized Neyman allocation that minimizes estimation variance under cost constraints. The least-favorable prior is shown to have symmetric two-point support, consistent with classical minimax theory.

### Strengths
1. Introduces the BAIwK problem and characterizes minimax-optimal policies under heterogeneous treatment costs—an important and previously unstudied extension of sequential experimentation and Bayesian BAI.
2. Elegant analytical framework:
The continuous-time reformulation via cumulative expenditure is elegant and technically sound, enabling exact derivations where discrete-time analysis is intractable.
3. Strong theoretical grounding:
Builds on and generalizes the literature on the generalized Wald problem (Adusumilli, 2024) and Bayesian BAI (Russo, 2016; Liang et al., 2022) while integrating results from decision theory and rational inattention.
4. Clear characterization of optimality:
The fixed (history-independent) sampling rule and two-point least-favorable prior are derived cleanly, and the resulting policy is interpretable as the cost-aware analogue of the Neyman allocation.
5. Potential relevance to practice:
Applicable to experimental design under cost and logistical constraints, e.g., in clinical trials, industrial testing, and adaptive resource allocation.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses
1. Lack of empirical validation:
The paper contains no simulation or numerical experiments. Even a simple 2-arm Gaussian example demonstrating regret behavior, boundary conditions, or sample allocations would substantiate the results.
2. Limited discussion of multi-arm generalization:
The focus is restricted to two arms. While the authors acknowledge this, some intuition or partial characterization for  K>2 would strengthen the contribution.
3. Strong proportional-arrival assumption:
The multi-resource extension assumes proportional arrival rates of resources; the paper notes this can be relaxed but offers no formal treatment.
4. Dense presentation:
The main text could better motivate the constants and steps leading to the minimax boundaries (Appendix A). Some symbols (e.g., “↔”, “↓”) appear as LaTeX artifacts and affect readability.
5. Positioning in literature:
The relationship between BAIwK and OAK (Li et al., 2023) could be elaborated more clearly. Further discussion of how this minimax framework contrasts with adaptive or heuristic budgeted BAI methods would help situate the contribution.

### Questions
1. Can the proposed minimax policy be approximated or implemented algorithmically in discrete time, and how sensitive is performance to cost misspecification?
2. How would the results change if costs were stochastic rather than deterministic?
3. Could the proportional-resource assumption in Theorem 2 be relaxed or replaced with an adaptive rule without losing minimax optimality?
4. Is there a numerical illustration (even in appendix form) to demonstrate how the minimax regret compares to heuristic or adaptive policies?

### Summary
This paper studies best arm identification with two arms and knapsack constraints. The authors' main result is the characterization of the optimal minimax policy: a history-independent constant allocation of the two arms. The authors derive their results by considering the continuous time version of the problem and showing how the allocation problem is the same as the Neyman allocation problem.

### Strengths
* The authors extend the well-known best arm identification problem to an important setting, namely, one with knapsack constraints.

* The authors derive an exact characterization of the solution in continuous time. The solution that constant allocation to arms (independent of history) is optimal is elegant and surprising.

* The authors' approach of considering the process in terms of cumulative resource expenditure instead of elapsed time is a neat trick that simplifies the problem analysis by unentangling time and cost.

### Weaknesses
* I found the paper quite difficult to understand. For example, the time change feature seemed to be a key tool in the solution but the main paper only has a brief paragraph mentioning it. Lines 257-263 are very dense; it would help to expand on some of the details here. Lines 265-268 propose unusual normalizing constants that are supposed to be explained in Appendix A; however, I couldn't find where this is done, could you please point me to it?

* The paper only considers two arms - this is a big restriction.

* Studying the continuous time version was motivated by the difficulty of characterizing the solution in discrete time. There are some recent works on bandits with knapsacks (e.g., "Non-monotonic resource utilization in the bandits with knapsacks problem" by Kumar and Kleinberg in NeurIPS 2022) that come up with a near-optimal policy for multiple arms in discrete time. Can similar techniques be adapted for the best arm identification problem? Do we really need continuous time analyses for this task?

* There are no empirical results comparing the derived allocation rule to heuristics used in practice.

### Summary
This paper focused on the fixed-budget best arm identification problem with knapsacks. It analyzed a proposed algorithm with knapsack constraint under the continuous time setting.

### Strengths
The paper presents a clear motivation of the problem and is with a good structure.

### Weaknesses
1. Section 2: More discussions on related works are appreciated. 
    1. There are many papers on *bandits with knapsacks* while only few of them are mentioned here. I would like to see the discussions on more such papers.
    2. The knapsack setting share some similarity with bandit setting with other constraints. For instance, the formulation in \url{https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/li24c/li24c.pdf} is similar as discussed by the author(s). However, again, the discussions on such works are quite limited.
    3. The continuous setting has also been discussed in many works. Again, more discussions on existing works are appreciated.
1. Decription and discussion of *best arm identification* problem in the beginning of Section 3 seem to be problematic.
    1. What the author(s) claimed as *BAI problem* seems to be the fixed-budget BAI problem, while what the author(s) claimed as *Wald problem* seems to be the fixed-confidence setting.
    2. Author(s) claimed that 'It will turn out that the solution to the Wald problem, shown in Section 4, simplifies easily to that of the BAI problem.' However, to my understanding, there is always some gap between optimal fixed-budget/fixed-confidence BAI algorithms. The author(s) may provide more explanations here.
    3. Besides, the author(s) may further clarify the focus of this works from the perspective of fixed-confidence/fixed-budget settings.
1. Description of the target and the design of algorithms can be improved.
    1. The design of algorithms are a bit confusing throughout the manuscript. Pseudocodes are appreciated. For example, it is not clear how to implement 'an implementation rule, $\delta\in\{0,1\}$' which is proposed in line 136.
    2. Relevantly, the definition of 'frequentist regret' in line 141 is also confusing. Besides, what are $c_0,\ c_1,\ q_0,\ q_1$?
1. Contribution of this work is not sufficiently clear.
     1. An instance is mentioned on the bottom of page 5. I suggest the author(s) to clarify the implication of this instance right away instead of postponing it to Appendix A.
     1. As many relevant works are not discussed, compared theoretically or compared numerically, it is hard to tell the significance of proposed methods.
     1. I failed to find a clear discussion on the upper/lower bounds which would explicitly indicate the superiority of the proposed methods.
