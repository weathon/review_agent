## Abstract
We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

### Summary
**Universal Beta Splatting (UBS)** targets the fragmentation in splatting pipelines, where geometry, view dependence, and dynamics are handled by separate components. The authors proposes a single primitive that models all three together. Specifically, it replaces fixed Gaussians with an N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernel and uses conditional slicing to obtain a renderable 3D primitive for a given view/time, avoiding SH or auxiliary color networks while remaining backward-compatible (recovering Gaussian splatting as a special case). Experiments across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks show consistent gains with real-time performance, and the authors emphasize that learned Beta parameters yield interpretable spatial/angle/time factors.

### Strengths
- The UBS kernel unifies spatial geometry, view-dependent appearance, and temporal dynamics within a single N-dimensional anisotropic Beta primitive. This design is well-motivated and, in my view, poised to make a substantial contribution to the community.
- The experimental results are outstanding, and the visualizations align well with the quantitative metrics.
- UBS features a pluggable architecture, allowing for seamless integration with other downstream tasks.

### Weaknesses
- Missing references for other works about alternative kernel design:
  - 3D-HGS: 3D Half-Gaussian Splatting, by Haolin Li et al.
  - [NeurIPS 2024] DisC-GS: Discontinuity-aware Gaussian Splatting, by Haoxuan Qu et al.
  - [CVPR 2025] Deformable Radial Kernel Splatting, by Yi-Hua Huang et al.
- The paper assumes substantial familiarity with Deformable Beta Splatting and therefore isn’t self-contained for readers new to Beta-based splatting. Several core ideas (e.g., how a Beta kernel parameterization induces opacity and color) are only sketched at a high level, with key mechanics deferred to prior work. As a result, understanding the contribution of UBS as a unified N-D generalization requires first reconstructing DBS’s basics. I recommend adding a focused preliminaries section that (i) recaps the Beta kernel definition and its bounded support; (ii) derives the mapping from Beta parameters to per-primitive opacity and radiance/color; and (iii) clarifies what is re-used vs. newly introduced in UBS (especially around conditional slicing and the removal of SH). This would make the paper accessible without cross-referencing DBS and would sharpen the statement of novelty.
- Minor typo error:
  - L171: `across both spatial, angular, and temporal dimension` -> `across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions`
- Missing comparison on FPS and primitive counts. It would help to include a direct comparison of primitive counts (Gaussian vs. UBS) and the corresponding FPS to clarify the runtime trade-offs.

### Questions
The demo appears to visualize surface normals. Did the authors report any quantitative normal-estimation results, and how are normals computed from the Beta kernel parameters?

### Summary
The paper proposes Universal Beta Splatting, which generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting into N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for unified modeling of spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions. Unlike fixed Gaussian kernels, UBS enables per-dimension shape control for adaptive geometry, reflection, and motion representation. It introduces spatial-orthogonal Cholesky parameterization, Beta-modulated conditional slicing, and CUDA-accelerated rendering. UBS remains backward-compatible with 3DGS/6DGS/7DGS and automatically decomposes scenes into geometric, material, and dynamic components. Experiments show up to +8.27 dB PSNR gain and ~50% faster training, establishing Beta kernels as efficient universal primitives for radiance field rendering.

### Strengths
1.The proposed UBS framework can simultaneously model diverse scene types, including static surfaces, view-dependent effects, surfaces, and dynamic scenes, within a single unified representation.

2.Each primitive in UBS is more parameter efficient than prior methods while remaining fully compatible with the 3DGS rendering pipeline, ensuring easy integration and deployment.

3.Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate UBS’s superior performance and strong generalization, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper claims that UBS is backward compatible with previous methods such as 3DGS, treating 3DGS as a special case. However, 3DGS models color using spherical harmonics, while UBS adopts a direct three dimensional color representation, which raises concerns about true compatibility between the two formulations.

2. The formulation in Equation (6) lacks theoretical justification or derivation. It is unclear how this design was obtained and whether it has any mathematical guarantees.

3. The paper does not provide analysis on the stability or convergence of the optimization process, particularly when extending UBS to high-dimensional Beta kernels, where parameter coupling may become complex.

### Summary
The paper integrates the "Deformable Beta Splatting" (DBS) method with existing works, "6DGS & 7DGS." It adopts the beta kernel function, (1 - distance_to_the_center)^(e^b), proposed in DBS, to replace the exponential decay term in the Gaussian function. This achieves similar effects to GES, which uses \beta to control the decay rate and kernel shape through \exp(-distance_to_the_center^\beta). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed combined method delivers good performance. However, the paper lacks a comparison of Gaussian quantities and model sizes. Additionally, the evaluation of dynamic reconstruction omits several state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
1. The combination of beta splatting with ND-GS is worth exploring; however, its novelty is questionable. I would appreciate a rebuttal from the authors to clarify this aspect.

2. Overall, the paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear and precise equations and method descriptions.

3. The demonstrated advantage over 4DGS is satisfactory, highlighting the method's practical significance compared to existing solutions.

### Weaknesses
1. The concept of beta control on the truncated unit circle region (x < 1) was originally introduced in the "Deformable Beta Splatting" paper. ND-GS, 6D-GS, and 7D-GS are established methods with their own innovations in representation. This paper simply applies beta control to 6D- and 7D-GS to achieve improved results, building on the strengths of these prior methods rather than introducing significant novelty.  

2. The number of Gaussians is a critical factor influencing the performance of GS-based methods, yet this aspect is omitted in the paper. Furthermore, file size, an equally important metric, is not demonstrated, leaving a gap in the evaluation of model efficiency.

3. The dynamic reconstruction section fails to include many state-of-the-art methods, limiting the practical relevance of the proposed combination method. Notably, 4DGS is not the leading approach in this domain. Advanced methods such as Ex4DGS, SC-GS, and Deformable-3DGS are recognized as state-of-the-art but are absent from the comparison.

4. The paper overlooks a significant body of work focused on improving primitive representations. The comparisons or discussions with notable methods should be included, such as:
- Deformable Radial Kernel Splatting
- TNT-GS: Truncated and Tailored Gaussian Splatting
- Triangle Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering
- Textured Gaussians for Enhanced 3D Scene Appearance Modeling
- Quadratic Gaussian Splatting: High Quality Surface Reconstruction with Second-order Geometric Primitives

### Questions
1. It is essential to specify the number and size of Gaussians used in each table to ensure a fair and transparent comparison.  

2. Comparisons or discussions with state-of-the-art primitive-enhanced GS methods and dynamic GS methods should be included. While achieving worse results is acceptable, providing a discussion would help the community better understand the reasons from a novel perspective.  

3. The paper should introduce more challenges associated with the existing deformable beta splatting and ND-GS methods. Currently, the methodology contribution is insufficiently detailed, and the experimental section is also lacking in depth.

### Summary
This paper proposes Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, UBS models spatial, angular, and temporal dependencies within a single representation, enabling controllable anisotropy and dynamic scene rendering without auxiliary networks. The method remains backward-compatible with 3DGS, ensuring usability and performance stability. Experiments demonstrate real-time rendering and consistent quality improvements across static, view-dependent, and dynamic scenes, establishing Beta kernels as a versatile and interpretable primitive for radiance field modeling.

### Strengths
This paper presents a technically solid and conceptually original generalization of Gaussian Splatting via N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels, enabling unified modeling of spatial, angular, and temporal properties. The proposed spatial-orthogonal Cholesky parameterization and Beta-modulated conditional slicing are elegant design choices that balance flexibility and efficiency. The paper demonstrates clear motivation from prior limitations (e.g., 3DGS, 6DGS, DBS) and provides strong empirical validation with consistent improvements across benchmarks. The backward compatibility with existing Gaussian-based methods is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances practical impact and ease of adoption. Overall, the work is novel, well-executed, and clearly presented, offering both theoretical insight and real-world significance for radiance field rendering.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is technically sophisticated, a few aspects could be strengthened. First, the novelty relative to prior high-dimensional splatting methods (e.g., 6DGS, DBS) is somewhat incremental — UBS’s core Beta kernel formulation mainly generalizes existing ideas with additional per-dimension flexibility. A deeper theoretical justification of why Beta kernels are fundamentally better suited for radiance modeling than Gaussians would improve clarity. Second, the empirical evaluation could be more comprehensive: ablations isolating the effects of Beta modulation, conditional slicing, and spatial-orthogonal Cholesky parameterization are limited. Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss training stability and computational overhead, since the Beta formulation introduces additional parameters and nonlinearities. Finally, while interpretability claims are appealing, the qualitative decomposition results (e.g., spatial vs. angular vs. temporal) would benefit from more rigorous quantitative validation.
