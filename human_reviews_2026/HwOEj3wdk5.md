## Abstract
Graph generative models have shown strong results in molecular design but struggle to scale to large, complex structures. While hierarchical methods improve scalability, they usually ignore node and edge features, which are critical in real-world applications. This issue is amplified in hypergraphs, where hyperedges capture higher-order relationships among multiple nodes. Despite their importance in domains such as 3D geometry, molecular systems, and circuit design, existing generative models rarely support both hypergraphs and feature generation at scale. In this paper, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical framework that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds multi-scale representations through node coarsening and refines them via localized expansion, guided by a novel node budget mechanism that controls granularity and ensures consistency across scales. Experiments on synthetic, 3D mesh and point cloud datasets show that FAHNES achieves state-of-the-art performance in jointly generating features and structure, advancing scalable hypergraph and graph generation.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of hypergraph generation. The authors introduce FAHNES, a hierarchical framework that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES achieves state-of-the-art performance in several benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow
- The authors conduct ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the node-budget and OT-coupling components.

### Weaknesses
- Hierarchical graph generation models have been commonly applied in molecular generation. Several important works [1-3] should be included in the related work, and their difference should be discussed. 

- In the experiments, the statistics of the used datasets should be provided to show the size of the dataset and the graph.

- As FAHNES is based on flow matching, it might be less efficient than one-shot methods. The inference time should be reported for a more comprehensive comparison between quality and cost.

- In Table 3, all the baselines are OOM. Hence, the performance of FAHNES cannot be compared.

### Summary
The paper introduces FAHNES for joint generative modeling of topology and features on hypergraphs (and graphs). It learns to invert a multi-scale coarsening to expansion process: standard spectral coarsening is applied on the clique expansion to obtain coarse levels; generation then happens on the bipartite (star) expansion via a flow-matching model that expands clusters and refines features from coarse to fine scales. A node-budget mechanism controls local growth and final size, and minibatch OT-coupling aligns permutations to stabilize training. Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs, 3D meshes, and point clouds show strong fidelity while scaling beyond flat/disjoint baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses the notorious permutation misalignment by constrained OT-coupling; the inclusion of an algorithm box and restricted local permutations (2 or 6) in each cluster shows care for both correctness and efficiency.
2. Many application domains (e.g., 3D geometry, circuits) need features as much as topology. Moving hierarchical generation into the feature-aware hypergraph regime is impactful for practitioners who cannot rely on topology-only generators.
3. By replacing flat, quadratic-cost modeling with a multi-scale next-scale prediction approach, the paper provides a credible path to larger instances without discarding features, a key limitation of many prior methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The 3D mesh setup appears two-stage: first learn topology, then generate coordinates with a separate Local-PPGN flow-matching model. It’s unclear whether FAHNES truly jointly models topology and features in this domain or only the topology (with features predicted post-hoc).
2. The refinement step uses fixed thresholds (e.g., 0.5 for edges). No analysis of calibration or threshold selection is provided.
3. OT-coupling is only applied within the siblings created by a single cluster expansion (2 or 6 permutations), with strict equivalence constraints on structure, budgets, and features. While elegant, this restriction may limit alignment benefits, and the ablation gains look small/uneven across datasets.

### Questions
1. Coarsening is performed on the clique expansion (Loukas) while expansion/refinement are learned on the bipartite representation. Please discuss the trade-offs (spectral preservation vs. hyperedge degree distortion) and whether you observed systematic topology artifacts when mapping between the two domains. Any guarantees that hyperedge cardinalities are preserved in expectation?

### Summary
This paper proposes FAHNES, a hierarchical generative model for (hyper)graphs.  It extends the recent hierarchical graph generator [1] and hypergraph generator (HYGENE [2]) by introducing a node budget mechanism and minibatch optimal transport (OT) coupling to align flow-matching predictions across scales.  The model jointly generates topology and features through a flow-matching ODE trained across multiple coarsening levels. Experiments on synthetic, 3D mesh, and point-cloud datasets show promising results compared to diffusion- and VAE-based baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper is very well-written and full of details.

- The authors conduct comprehensive experiments.

- The ablations are thorough, and the complexity discussion provides useful insight into scalability.

### Weaknesses
1. The main ideas—representing hypergraphs as bipartite graphs and using a coarsening–refinement hierarchy—are largely borrowed from [1] and HYGENE [2]. FAHNES mainly replaces the diffusion-based training paradigm with flow matching and adds the budget and OT-coupling components, which are meaningful engineering refinements but not a fundamental conceptual breakthrough.

2. The model depends on a complete bipartite representation of hypergraphs, which is computationally expensive and scales poorly.

3. The model heavily relies on Laplacian spectral features and SignNet encodings, which require repeated eigen-decompositions across multiple levels. This design becomes computationally challenging and limits scalability as the graph or hypergraph size increases.

4. The core flow-matching objective is described in Appendix E.  The main paper should include a clear formulation of the training loss and explicitly connect it to the main model variables (v, e, f, F)

5. Limited and partially unfair baselines. On the graph point cloud datasets, the paper only compares FAHNES to DiGress and DeFoG, both of which are designed for discrete graph generation rather than point clouds. Reporting “OOM” results for these baselines is not informative or fair. Similarly, for 3D mesh generation, only very limited baselines are considered; comparison with more relevant mesh or point-cloud generation methods would make the evaluation stronger.

6. The paper does not mention a code release, nor does it provide sufficient implementation details (e.g., architecture parameters, training hyperparameters) to ensure reproducibility.

### Questions
1. Why use Spectrum-preserving coarsening in the node pair merging process?

2. Beyond introducing the budget and OT-coupling mechanisms, how does FAHNES fundamentally differ from HYGENE [2] in methodology?

3. During generation (from level L → L−1 → L−2 → … → 1), does each level require predicting a separate velocity field for flow matching, or is the same neural network shared across all levels?

### Summary
This paper introduces FAHNES, a feature-aware hierarchical (hyper)graph generative framework that jointly models topology and features across multiple scales. The key idea is to perform next-scale prediction via a node budget mechanism that controls local graph growth and ensures cross-scale consistency. Additionally, the authors extend flow-matching optimal transport coupling (OT-coupling) to hierarchical structures to stabilize training and align node-level correspondences.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a feature-aware mechanism into a hierarchical generative framework, jointly modeling topology and node/hyperedge features. 

Treating graphs as special cases of hypergraphs makes the approach theoretically general and practically versatile.

The paper evaluates FAHNES on diverse datasets, including both featureless and featured hypergraphs. Results demonstrate SOTA performance in topology–feature joint generation.

### Weaknesses
Current experiments only involve continuous geometric features (3D coordinates). The applicability to categorical or mixed-type features (e.g., molecular attributes) remains untested.

Although DiGress and DeFoG encounter OOM issues on our large-scale point cloud datasets, this does not necessarily imply that these models are inferior. They are primarily designed for small- and medium-scale discrete graphs, focusing on structural fidelity rather than scalability. A fair benchmarking protocol should therefore distinguish small-scale fidelity benchmarks (e.g., molecular graphs) from large-scale scalability benchmarks (e.g., 3D meshes or hypergraphs).

### Questions
How is error accumulation across scales mitigated in the node budget mechanism? Since the node budget mechanism recursively propagates predicted budget values through multiple scales, small prediction errors at higher levels could potentially amplify during expansion. Have the authors analyzed the stability or robustness of this mechanism to such accumulated errors?

The paper shows impressive results on hypergraphs, but in standard graph domains, evaluation seems insufficient. Moreover, the point cloud experiment does not allow a fair comparison with baseline models due to OOM errors. Could the authors clarify whether FAHNES has a measurable advantage on typical graphs such as molecules or social networks?
