## Abstract
Controlling the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a central challenge for their safe and reliable deployment, yet a clear understanding of the trade-offs involved remains elusive. Current approaches to conditioning generation, spanning from expensive fine-tuning to lightweight activation steering or basic prompting, are often evaluated with a narrow focus on their effectiveness at injecting or removing a target concept, neglecting critical side effects on the quality of the generation. This paper presents a systematic investigation of these methods in both injection and removal scenarios, introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess generation quality and move beyond unreliable measures like perplexity. Our analysis reveals that the latter is a fundamentally brittle proxy for fluency, often rewarding repetitive text while penalizing well-formed outputs.
Using more robust metrics, we find that there is no ``free lunch'' in conditioning: lightweight methods frequently achieve conditioning at a steep cost to expressiveness. Furthermore, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked interaction with the training paradigm: activation steering methods are far less effective on instruction-tuned models than on their base counterparts.
While supervised fine-tuning emerges as the most robust method, it also exhibits significant side effects, such as collateral learning of possibly undesired linguistic characteristics of the training set. Finally, simple prompting might be an alternative to more sophisticated conditioning methods for basic concept injection, but it fails to scale to tasks requiring more thorough output control, such as concept removal. Collectively, our findings challenge common assumptions in the field, providing a more realistic characterization of the conditioning landscape and a simple but principled methodology for future evaluation.

### Summary
This paper addresses the limitation that existing evaluations of conditioning approaches focus solely on their effectiveness, by examining the trade-off between effectiveness and fluency. To this end, the authors introduce several metrics and evaluate non-conditioned, prompted, SFT, ITI, and CAA, Linear Act models on both instruction-tuned and base versions.

### Strengths
- **The motivation is clear and persuasive.** While many conditioning approaches have been proposed, most studies only test whether the intended conditioning effect is achieved, without examining the overall quality of the generated responses. Typically, they rely on classifiers or LLM judges to assess whether the conditioning goal has been met. For assessing overall generation quality (here, fluency), metrics like perplexity and MMLU are sometimes used. However, perplexity often rewards repetitive outputs, and MMLU, designed to test factual knowledge across 57 subjects, fails to capture subtle stylistic or persona-related differences in generative responses. In other words, neither metric provides a precise evaluation of conditional generation quality.

### Weaknesses
Although this paper is intended as an analytical study, it lacks a clear rationale for the chosen metrics and does not provide sufficiently clear insights in the result analysis.

> Metric
- **POOL OF OBSERVABLES**: The overall correlation remains low (around 0.2) even when included, as reported in the appendix, occasionally exhibiting abnormally high spikes in irregular cases. In such cases, how should the Concept Similarity be interpreted? A higher similarity score does not necessarily imply more effective concept injection. Wouldn’t it be more appropriate to report the proportion of samples exceeding a certain similarity threshold, rather than the raw similarity values?
  - Given the difference in granularity, it might be more reliable to employ an LLM judge (1 if included, 0 otherwise) rather than Sentence-BERT for evaluation.
- **Generation Similarity**: To capture redundant or repetitive patterns, it is more appropriate to analyze individual pieces of information at the atomic level rather than at the sentence level. When the relationships between sentences are strong, the metric could also be interpreted as indicating higher coherence.
- **POS KL**: How can we determine whether the observed changes stem from temperature and sampling stochasticity, or are genuinely induced by the intervention itself? The standard deviation of ITI, in fact, appears to be quite large. Furthermore, the rationale for treating changes in the POS distribution as "negative" warrants further clarification. 
- **Type-Token Ratio**: The same concern raised regarding POS KL likely applies here as well.
- **Generation Length**: Similar to POS KL and the Type-Token Ratio, it is unclear why a reduction in generation length is regarded as negative. A shorter output could simply indicate the removal of redundant adjectives, resulting in text that is more compact and easier to read.
- I think the validity of POS KL, Type-Token Ratio, and Generation Length would be better understood if considered together with coherence and completeness metrics.


> Results
- In the results section, you focus on describing the validity of the metrics rather than presenting findings that address your main research objectives. It might be clearer to present these two aspects in separate subsections.
- **The differences among Smollm3-3B, Qwen3-0.6B, and Qwen3-8B seem significant but are not sufficiently explained.** For instance, if the larger model (Qwen3-8B) tends to respond less effectively to activation steering, this should be clarified, as its Concept Similarity and Fluency results seem to contradict the overall interpretation. (Or, it could be related to the issue I raised regarding the POOL OF OBSERVABLES metric.)
- The behavioral differences between instruction-tuned models and base models have already been demonstrated in the original ITI paper. However, your work re-emphasizes this finding, even presenting it as part of the distinction from concurrent research.

### Questions
- Please report the success rate of concept injection based on Concept Similarity (e.g., the proportion of samples exceeding a defined threshold or using an LLM judge for binary classification).
- Please provide a few example outputs illustrating the changes in Type-Token Ratio, POS KL, and Generation Length between Uncond and ITI settings.
- In the Results section, please add a description of the experimental outcomes in addition to the analysis of the metrics.
- What findings can be drawn from the other metrics besides Fluency, regarding the trade-off?

### Summary
This paper conducts a systematic and empirical study of conditioning methods for large language models (LLMs), including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), activation steering, and prompting — focusing on the trade-off between conditioning effectiveness and fluency. The authors propose a rich evaluation framework that goes beyond standard perplexity to include linguistic metrics (type–token ratio, generation similarity, POS KL, etc.) and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. They benchmark methods across multiple tasks (concept injection and toxicity mitigation) and models (base vs instruction-tuned variants). Their findings highlight key insights: (1) perplexity is a poor proxy for fluency, (2) lightweight steering methods incur substantial expressive costs, and (3) instruction-tuning significantly hinders steering effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive and well-structured evaluation.
2. Clear empirical evidence that perplexity can be misleading for fluency.
3. Identification of a practically important interaction. The paper finds that instruction-tuned models resist activation steering (Concept Similarity often not above base), with qualitative analyses explaining adherence to generic prompts.

### Weaknesses
There is limited originality in core methodology. While the experimental depth and clarity are commendable, the paper does not introduce fundamentally new conditioning or evaluation algorithms; it aggregates, benchmarks, and critiques existing ones. There is a lack of a novel algorithmic contribution or a substantial theoretical advance beyond metric critique and aggregation.

### Summary
This work investigates how different methods for controlling the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as fine-tuning, activation steering, and prompting, balance effectiveness in injecting or removing concepts with the fluency and quality of generated text.
The authors introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that moves beyond traditional metrics like perplexity, which they argue is an unreliable measure of fluency.
Their systematic analysis reveals that lightweight conditioning approaches often degrade output expressiveness significantly.
Meanwhile, supervised fine-tuning is robust but can inadvertently impart unwanted linguistic biases from training data.
They also find that activation steering works less well on instruction-tuned models compared to base models.
Simple prompting may suffice for basic concept injection but falls short for more complex tasks like concept removal.

### Strengths
1. The paper goes beyond conventional metrics (like perplexity) by proposing a more holistic methodology to assess both effectiveness and generation quality.
2. It rigorously compares multiple conditioning techniques, including fine-tuning, activation steering, and prompting, in both concept injection and removal scenarios.
3. By exposing side effects such as collateral learning during fine-tuning or limits of simple prompts, the study provides actionable advice for practitioners seeking safe output control.

### Weaknesses
1. Potential generalizability issues: results may depend heavily the specific dataset and the small-size models used. Broader validation across diverse models and tasks would strengthen claims.
2. The evaluation of fluency is highly relied on the LLM-as-a-judge method. However, the authors does not provide any human check to ensure the quality of the scores generated by the LLM.

### Summary
This work investigates methods for conditioning the outputs of large language models (LLMs), comparing expensive fine-tuning, lightweight activation steering, and prompt-based approaches. The authors conduct experiments on both concept injection and concept removal, and evaluate the methods using both newly proposed and established metrics. The analysis shows that lightweight approaches can often achieve conditioning, but at the cost of reduced expressiveness.

### Strengths
1. Understanding the differences among conditioning methods is important for LLM-based applications.

2. The core finding that lightweight methods may sacrifice expressiveness is interesting and relevant.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper’s contribution feels limited. While the experiments are thorough, the work lacks deeper analysis explaining why activation steering leads to reduced expressiveness, which limits the practical value of the findings.

2. The study does not offer practical guidance on how to mitigate expressiveness loss, nor does it propose criteria for deciding which conditioning method to use in real applications.

3. The investigation of prompt-based methods is underexplored. Prompt engineering alone is not a sufficiently strong baseline here. Training-free prompt optimization approaches (e.g., DsPy [1], TextGrad [2]) would provide a more meaningful comparison, especially because prompt engineering does not use training data signals, while both SFT and activation steering do. The absence of such methods weakens the completeness and relevance of the comparison.

### Questions
1. What underlying factors cause the observed differences in expressiveness across methods?

2. How should practitioners choose among fine-tuning, activation steering, and prompting for their specific applications?
