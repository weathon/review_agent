## Abstract
In continual learning, knowledge must be preserved and re-used between tasks, requiring a balance between maintaining
good transfer to future tasks and minimizing forgetting of previously learned ones. As several practical algorithms have been
devised to address the continual learning setting, the natural question of providing reliable risk certificates has also been raised.
Although there are results for specific settings and algorithms on the behavior of memory stability, generally applicable upper bounds on learning plasticity are few and far between. 

In this work, we extend existing PAC-Bayes bounds for online learning and time-uniform offline learning to the continual learning
setting. We derive general upper bounds on the cumulative generalization loss applicable for any task distribution and learning
algorithm as well as oracle bounds for Gibbs posteriors and compare their effectiveness for several different
task distributions. We demonstrate empirically that our approach yields non-vacuous bounds for several continual learning
problems in vision, as well as tight oracle bounds on linear regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general upper bound on learning plasticity for continual learning.

### Summary
The paper extends existing PAC-Bayes bounds used for online and offline learning to address the setting of continual learning, where tasks arrive sequentially. The authors focus on deriving general upper bounds on cumulative generalization loss applicable to any task distribution and learning algorithm. The paper also addresses oracle bounds for Gibbs posteriors and compares these approaches across various task distributions, as well as testing their empirical validity on vision-based continual learning problems. This work represents the effort to establish upper bounds on learning plasticity within the domain of continual learning, given its unique challenge of balancing knowledge retention and forward transfer.

### Strengths
1. **Rigorous Theory**: The extension of PAC-Bayes bounds to continual learning, especially in providing non-vacuous bounds, is a theoretical contribution.
    
2. **Empirical Validation for the Theory**: The authors provide empirical evidence that supports their theoretical claims across various task distributions, including vision-based datasets. Experiments on linear regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of their bounds.

3. **Good Presentation:** The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. **Use of Cumulative Loss:** The Cumulative Loss is a typical measure in online/continual meta-learning. For continual learning, the bound should be analyzed with the average loss in Definition 4. In contrast, the whole paper focused on cumulative loss. 

2. **Novelty and Related Work Discussion:** The paper claims to be the ﬁrst general upper bound on learning plasticity for continual learning, while it missed a lot of theoretical work in continual learning [1, 2, 3], and its most related work is in online/continual meta-learning [4,5,6,7]. In particular, the discussion regarding [4, 5, 6, 7] should be in depth, where these methods also brought novel algorithms to reduce the cumulative loss as well as improve its upper bounds.

3. **Theoretical Limitation:** The proposed bounds depend on $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{H}} d(\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2)$, which are hard to evaluate and the bound could be very loose. In addition, the results require that the number of samples per task should exceed the square root of the total number of tasks, which neglects the positive transfer among tasks.

4. **Limited Experiments:** The experiments are somehow too simple.

### Questions
As the authors have acknowledged several limitations in the main paper, and considering the questions raised above, I would like to know how the authors plan to address them.

I would expect the authors to adequately resolve most of my concerns; otherwise, I would be reluctant to recommend acceptance, as the limitations appear to be quite significant.

### Summary
The paper provides a PAC-Bayes bound on the cumulative loss (loss summed over each retraining of the model) for continual learning, which is an evaluation metric that measures the efficacy of learning algorithms over an entire predictive sequence. The author then demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed bounds on standard continual learning datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written as an extension of previous papers, namely (Haddouche & Guedj, 2022). The writing and proofs are clear and seem technically correct. The formulation of the problem is original as the consideration of CuL is indeed new.

### Weaknesses
Minor:
1. Although the presentation is clear, the writing can be more inviting to readers. E.g, some brief introduction on the setup of PAC-Bayes bounds in general can greatly help the readers with the required background. 
2. The related work section can include some newer papers, e.g [1,2], that propose both empirical methods, but also with the appropriate theoretical analysis on forgetting/knowledge transfer bounds. 

Major:
1. Some of the assumptions might be unrealistic.
2. The bounds seem loose in scenarios where a proper continual learning technique was applied in the setting.

### Questions
1. In Figure 1, the author used the notation $Q_{1:t}$, but it doesn't seem like this notation is used anywhere else in the analysis. Is this notation the same as $Qt$?
2. Line 187-188, Can the author address why, in a continual learning context, the upper bounds that converge as the number of tasks increases are vastly preferable? This is an important motivation to motivate the rest of the analysis in the paper. 
3. Line 189-190, Is the assumption that the loss function is upper-bounded by a constant realistic? Most of the loss functions, such as MSE and cross-entropy, are not upper-bounded. The author should provide a few applicable loss functions here as an example. 
4.  In the case of equation 3, can the author explain which part of the bound applying a proper continual learning method reduces? Intuitively, does a buffer-based algorithm help reduce the first term, while a regularization-based algorithm reduces the KL term of the bounds?
5. In the experiments, error percentage is used to evaluate the efficacy of different methods as a loss function, but it is generally not used to optimize a learning algorithm. Will this violate the assumptions made to prove the bounds?

### Summary
The paper extends PAC-Bayes tools from online/time-uniform settings to derive upper bounds on the cumulative (forward) loss in continual learning. The authors give conditions under which the bounds converge as the number of tasks grows (notably when the per-task sample size scales sufficiently with the number of tasks), and they analyze several controlled scenarios (task repeats, alternation, gradual change) to interpret the oracle bounds. There is some empirical validations of the claims.

### Strengths
- The paper provides an original contribution by formulating PAC-Bayes bounds on the cumulative error in continual learning, addressing a problem that has received limited theoretical treatment so far.
- The specialization of the results to different continual learning scenarios (repeated tasks, alternating tasks, gradual changes) is a useful aspect that makes the theoretical framework more interpretable.
- The proof techniques might be of methodological interest.

### Weaknesses
* **Lack of narrative and intuition.**
  The paper is presented as a sequence of results with limited discussion. The authors should provide more intuition after each main theorem, explain the meaning of the key terms, and discuss when the bounds are informative.

* **Insufficient comparison with prior work.**
  The relationship with existing results (e.g., Friedman & Meir; Haddouche & Guedj) is not clearly established. A more explicit contrast between this setting and previous PAC-Bayes formulations for continual or online learning is needed.

* **Assumptions and applicability.**
  Some assumptions (bounded or sub-Gaussian loss, compact hypothesis space, strict minima) are strong and not discussed in detail. The paper should clarify how these assumptions affect the applicability of the results to neural networks.

* **Presentation and readability.**
  The paper assumes substantial familiarity with PAC-Bayes theory. Proof ideas and key steps should be summarized in the main text. Figures and tables could be improved for clarity.

* **Experimental section.**
  The experiments are not clearly described. Some results (e.g., high CIFAR10 error) are unexplained. It is unclear whether models were trained to convergence, and how optimization error is handled in the evaluation of bounds. Also, the visualizations are not well annotated.

* **Discussion of overparameterization.**
  Although the text mentions that overparameterization affects the bounds, this is not explored in detail. A more systematic analysis or clearer interpretation would improve the contribution.

### Questions
1. In Corollary 3.1, the constant (K) (and the assumption of bounded loss) should be re-introduced. 
2. Why is the KL divergence measured only with respect to task-shared parameters (line 182)? Would it not be possible to include task-specific parameters by defining them as zero for other tasks?
3. The empirical results on CIFAR10 show unusually high errors. Could the authors clarify the training procedure and whether models were trained to convergence?
4. How is optimization error accounted for in the experiments? If models are not trained to convergence, how does this affect the interpretation of the bounds?
5. Could the authors explain why variational inference yields tighter bounds than EWC or SGD, beyond the observation that it optimizes a PAC-Bayes objective?
6. The oracle bounds assume strict global minima and compact hypothesis space. Are these assumptions essential, or can the results be extended to more realistic cases?
