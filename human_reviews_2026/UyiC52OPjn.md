## Abstract
Characterizing dynamical systems given limited measurements is a common challenge throughout the physical and biological sciences. However, this task is challenging, especially due to transient variability in systems with equivalent long-term dynamics. We address this by introducing smooth prototype equivalences (SPE), a framework matches between sparse observations of phase space and prototypical behaviors using invertible neural networks. SPE enables classification by comparing the deformation loss of the observed sparse measurements to the prototype dynamics. Furthermore, our approach enables estimation of the invariant sets of the observed dynamics through the learned mapping from prototype space to data space. Our method outperforms existing techniques in the classification of oscillatory systems and can efficiently identify invariant structures like limit cycles and fixed points in an equation-free manner, even when only a small, noisy subset of the phase space is observed. Finally, we show how our method can be used for the detection of biological processes like the cell cycle trajectory from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data.

### Summary
This paper introduces a method called Smooth Prototype Equivalences (SPE) for characterizing dynamical systems from sparse, noisy observations without explicit governing equations. SPE uses invertible neural networks to learn smooth diffeomorphisms between observed data and predefined prototype dynamics (e.g., limit cycles or fixed points) to exploiting the systems sharing the same qualitative behavior. The method has two purposes: localizing invariant structures by mapping prototype attractors to data space via the learned inverse transformation, and classifying dynamical regimes by comparing equivalence losses across prototypes. Experiments show SPE outperforms existing baselines on sparse, noisy data and successfully extends to high-dimensional systems, including a 6D gene regulatory network and real 100-dimensional single-cell RNA velocity data where it recovers cell cycle gene expression patterns.

### Strengths
(1) Technical contribution with Fourier Feature Coupling layers is a novel idea;
(2) The use of prototypes (e.g., limit cycle, fixed point) provides clear physical and qualitative meaning to the learned mappings;
(3) The method can infer invariant structures and classify system behaviors directly from sparse vector-field data without knowing governing equations;
(4) The method effectively scales to high-dimensional systems and identifies the cell cycle from real single-cell RNA data, which shows practical value in biological science in a data-driven approach.

### Weaknesses
(1) Requires predefined prototypes based on domain knowledge in advance, which limits its applicability;
(2) Training multiple invertible neural networks for different prototypes can be expensive, especially for high-dimensional data;
(3) The method only guarantees local equivalence near observed data points.

### Questions
(1) Since SPE requires a set of prototype systems (e.g., limit cycles, fixed points), how should users select or construct these prototypes in practice? What happens if the true system exhibits a behavior not covered by the prototype?
(2) Is the learned diffeomorphism $H_\theta$ unique? Could different network initializations produce distinct but equally valid mappings?
(3) Why Fourier features specifically? Have you tried other function approximators like neural ODEs or implicit layers for the coupling?
(4) Given that Koopman operator methods are now also popular tools for data-driven dynamical analysis, how does SPE relate to them? Could these two frameworks complement each other? In your SPE equation (i.e., Eq. 1), the $\partial_x H(x)\cdot \dot{x}$ is equivalent to $dH(x)/dt = \mathcal{L}H(x)$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Koopman generator. How would you think of it? Perhaps, considering the Koopman operator framework would help enhance the mathematical formulation of your method. Here is a list of papers you may have interest:

### Summary
This paper proposes 'Smooth Prototype Equivalences (SPE)', a novel framework for characterizing the long-term behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems from sparse, noisy, and high-dimensional data, a common challenge in the physical and biological sciences.
The core idea is to learn a mapping that 'smoothly' deforms the data space into a known prototype space using Invertible Neural Networks (INNs), rather than directly modeling the complex, unknown dynamics. This mapping aligns the observed data with simple, well-understood 'prototype' dynamics (e.g., stable fixed points, simple limit cycles).
This approach provides two main functions:
	Localization: It pinpoints the shape and location of hidden 'invariant sets' (e.g., limit cycles, fixed points) in the original data space via the learned inverse mapping (H^(-1)).
	Classification: It allows for classifying the system's dynamical regime by comparing the goodness-of-fit (lowest loss) across multiple prototypes.
The authors demonstrate that SPE is robust, outperforming existing techniques, especially in realistic, data-scarce, and noisy scenarios. Moreover, they successfully apply this method to high-dimensional biological data (single-cell gene expression data) to extract the complex 'cell cycle' trajectory.

### Strengths
1. Data Efficiency and Robustness: This is the method's strongest point. As shown in Figure 3, it performs far more stably and accurately than other methods (SINDy, MLP), even with very few samples (N=25) and significant noise. This is critical for real-world scientific applications.
2. Interpretability and Localization: Unlike simple 'black-box' classifiers (e.g., TWA), SPE provides the actual shape and location of the invariant set in the data space via H^(-1). This offers scientists deeper insights—not just "what kind?" but also "where and in what shape?"
3. Scalability and Practicality: The method's effectiveness is demonstrated beyond 2D examples, scaling successfully to 6D (Figure 4) and 100D (Figure 5, scRNA-seq) high-dimensional data. The extraction of a biologically meaningful trajectory from 100D real-world cell cycle data is a particularly impressive result.
4. Equation-Free Approach: It can identify the core structure of a dynamical system  without any knowledge of the system's governing equations.

### Weaknesses
1.	Dependence on Prototypes: The method relies on the user defining a 'dictionary' of prototypes in advance, based on what dynamics they expect to find. If the true dynamics are of a completely novel form or are not in the dictionary, the classification and localization may fail.
2.	Limitations on Complex Dynamics: As the authors note, this work primarily focuses on simple attractors like stable fixed points or limit cycles. Chaotic systems, characterized by 'strange attractors' with fractal structures, are difficult to map to simple prototypes using smooth equivalence.

### Questions
1.	How sensitive are the accuracy and stability of the results to the INN architecture (e.g., number of blocks, number of Fourier features)? Could you share any empirical guidelines for hyperparameter tuning?
2.	A question regarding the construction of the prototype dictionary: How would SPE handle a complex system that contains multiple different dynamical behaviors (e.g., a system with two fixed points and one limit cycle coexisting)?

### Summary
This paper proposes a Smooth Prototypical Equivalence (SPE) framework, a model designed to predict the invariant sets of unknown dynamical systems by pushforwarding known, simple prototypical vector fields. The model learns diffeomorphisms, parameterized by normalizing flows, that smoothly map between vector field data sampled from unknown systems and their prototypical counterparts. If a system is smoothly (or orbit) conjugate to a specific prototypical vector field, then the pushforward of the observations should match that prototypical vector field. This principle is encoded in the equivalence loss, which measures the discrepancy between the two. The prototypical vector field with the lowest equivalence loss is then selected as the canonical form of the data, and the pullback of its invariant set serves as an approximation of the invariant set of the data. The proposed method is benchmarked on several synthetic examples as well as a more complex single-cell gene expression dataset.

### Strengths
Matching the pushforward vector field with certain prototypes via smooth conjugacy is novel and conceptually sound. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
However, it is not entirely clear whether the smooth/orbit equivalence loss can be reliably applied in more general settings. When the equivalence loss is exactly zero, the pullback of the prototypical invariant set indeed corresponds to the true invariant set of the data dynamics. Yet, when the loss is nonzero, it is not guaranteed that a smaller equivalence loss implies a closer approximation of the true invariant set.

If the underlying invariant sets are hyperbolic, the equivalence loss might still be meaningful. The persistence theorem ensures that hyperbolic invariant sets cannot be destroyed by small perturbations. Thus, if the equivalence loss can be regarded as a perturbation metric, one might argue that a smaller loss increases the likelihood that the pullbacked invariant set remains approximately invariant. However, since the persistence theorem requires $C^1$-closeness, this justification is not entirely rigorous in the current formulation based on C0-closeness. It may be possible for the authors to derive a $C^1$ bound from $C^0$-closeness, though this is uncertain.

Moreover, if the underlying invariant sets are non-hyperbolic, no such guarantee exists. Even a small perturbation (= a nonzero equivalence loss) can drastically alter the structure of the invariant sets. The benchmarked systems in the paper appear to be restricted to low-dimensional, hyperbolic cases (such as attracting limit cycles), where the theoretical assumptions implicitly hold. It remains unclear whether the proposed framework would perform reliably beyond these settings.

### Questions
The authors' method relies on the assumption that a smaller equivalence loss implies a closer correspondence between the true invariant set of the target system and the pullbacked one. However, this relationship is not theoretically justified in the paper. What theoretical guarantee does your equivalence loss provide regarding the recoverability or approximation quality of invariant sets? Specifically,

- Can the equivalence loss be interpreted as a meaningful bound or metric (e.g., in the persistence theorem sense) on the deviation between true and estimated invariant sets?
- If not, under what conditions (e.g., hyperbolicity, structural stability) can a smaller equivalence loss be expected to correspond to a more accurate recovery of the invariant structure?
