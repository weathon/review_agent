## Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening relies on accurate polyp segmentation, yet subtle appearance differences and ambiguous boundaries in colonoscopy images make this task challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose FSFMamba, a dual-domain fusion network that jointly models boundary uncertainty and frequency structure to improve delineation. In the spatial domain, a Fuzzy Spatial Control Mechanism (FSCM) instantiates an interval type-2 membership to localize uncertainty at boundary bands while preserving stability in homogeneous regions. In the spectral domain, a Frequency Adaptive Selection Mechanism (FASM) performs octave-wise spectral decomposition and applies learnable band-wise weighting to emphasize task-relevant subbands and suppress spurious responses. The two streams are fused by a Mamba-based state-space block that enables long-range, low-latency interactions and pre-norm residual refinement for stable optimization. Extensive experiments show FSFMamba consistently outperforms recent baselines with sharper boundaries, fewer false positives, and strong robustness.

### Summary
To address the challenges of subtle appearance variations and ambiguous boundaries in colonoscopy images, this paper proposes a dual-domain neural network (FSFMamba) designed to model boundary uncertainty and frequency structures for improved delineation. In the spatial domain, a Fuzzy Spatial Control Mechanism (MFCM) is employed to localize uncertainty within boundary regions. Meanwhile, in the frequency domain, a Frequency Adaptive Selection Mechanism (FASM) emphasizes task-relevant sub-bands while suppressing spurious responses. By integrating the spatial and spectral domains, the model achieves long-range, low-latency interaction and pre-norm residual refinement, enabling stable optimization.

### Strengths
1. The visualization of the motivation provides a detailed justification for the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling frequency information and boundary uncertainty, deeply revealing the research motivation behind this work.
2. The paper presents a clear overall logical flow in its methodological description, with well-formulated equations and strong readability.
3. The experimental validation in this paper is relatively thorough, and the proposed modules demonstrate a certain degree of effectiveness and segmentation potential.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks sufficient innovation and shows a certain degree of methodological similarity with the following two works:
(1) “Dual-Domain Fusion Network Based on Wavelet Frequency Decomposition and Fuzzy Spatial Constraint for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation”
(2) “Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation”.
2. In terms of the visualization of segmentation results, it is difficult to clearly observe the differences between the proposed method and the compared SOTA methods. The authors are advised to include special annotations or visual highlights in the corresponding figures to better emphasize the superiority of the proposed approach.
3. For the compared SOTA methods, the authors should provide detailed numerical values of FLOPs, Parameters, and FPS. Moreover, since the proposed method is based on Mamba, whose computational characteristics differ from other SOTA methods, additional parameter computation considerations should be included (refer to: https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/issues/110).
4. Regarding the polyp segmentation experiments, there exists another dataset named Kvasir-Sessile. The authors are encouraged to include comparative experiments on this dataset to ensure the completeness and comprehensiveness of the experimental evaluation.

### Questions
1. Did the authors use the same random seed for both the comparative experiments and the ablation studies to ensure consistency and fairness of the results?
2. The metric name should be formatted consistently as mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) throughout the manuscript, following standard conventions in the computer vision and segmentation literature. Please also make sure this correction is reflected uniformly across all tables, figures, and captions.
3. Can the authors provide complete, runnable code to ensure full reproducibility of the proposed model and experiments? Public availability of implementation details would significantly enhance the credibility and impact of the work.
4. Could the authors expand the ablation study analysis directly in the main text rather than keeping it in the supplementary material? Including this discussion in the main body of the paper would improve the completeness and readability, as it allows readers to better understand how each component contributes to the overall performance.

### Summary
This work introduces FSFMamba, a novel dual-domain network for polyp segmentation. The innovative contribution lies in its attempt to concurrently model spatial boundary uncertainty via interval type-2 fuzzy logic (FSCM) and structural information via adaptive frequency-domain selection (FASM), integrated within a modern state-space (Mamba) backbone. In terms of completeness, the work is presented as a comprehensive study, featuring a detailed methodology, extensive comparative experiments against numerous state-of-the-art methods on five public benchmarks, and exceptionally thorough ablation studies validating the authors' design choices. While the empirical effort is substantial, the work's impact is contingent upon addressing the critical issues of methodological consistency and statistical validation, as detailed in the main review.

### Strengths
1.The paper addresses the high-impact clinical challenge of segmenting polyps with indistinct boundaries, a critical task for improving computer-aided diagnosis of CRC.
2.The proposed framework is conceptually innovative, presenting a new synthesis of Type-2 fuzzy logic, multi-band frequency analysis, and a Mamba architecture for this specific task.
3.The model demonstrates state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across five diverse public datasets, showing robustness in both domain-specific and out-of-domain scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1.On the FSCM Module: The paper’s core claim that its "interval type-2" fuzzy (FSCM) is superior—is supported only by theory and lacks empirical comparison. To justify its complexity, a quantitative ablation study comparing it to a simpler Type-1 fuzzy baseline is essential.
2.On the FASM Module (Contradictions):  
A major contradiction exists between the main paper and the appendix.Figure 4 and Eq. 6 clearly define the sub-band partitioning using $max(|u|,|v|)$, which corresponds to a Chebyshev distance and creates rectangular sub-bands.In contrast, Appendix A.4 provides the theoretical support based on radial distance ($r=\sqrt{\omega_{x}^{2}+\omega_{y}^{2}}$), which corresponds to a Euclidean distance and creates circular sub-bands.This fundamental discrepancy must be resolved.
A second contradiction exists regarding the nature of the frequency bands.The main text (Section 3.3) explicitly states the use of four fixed octave-wise bands.However, Appendix A.4 introduces a complex mechanism for learnable band boundaries ($\phi_b$) that are parameterized by $\theta_b$. The authors must clarify: are the band boundaries fixed or learnable? 
3.On the FASM Module (Lack of Evidence): The central claim that FASM utilizes "critical mid-frequency information" is unsubstantiated. This requires visual evidence, such as the Selection Map ($A_b$) from Eq. 7, to prove the model actually weights these frequencies.
4.On Architectural Clarity (D2PM): The diagram in Figure 5 depicts the inputs to D2PM as X_hat and X_Fuzzy, yet it does not demonstrate how the output Fc’ from the preceding stage is integrated into the current stage."

### Questions
1.Regarding the FASM Module: Appendix A.4 discusses the use of raised-cosine filters to reduce spectral leakage. However, the FASM module in the main paper is described as using a binary mask for spectral extraction. Please explain this discrepancy. Furthermore, please clarify the relationship between the theoretical discussion in Appendix A.4 and the specific sub-band thresholds chosen. It is unclear how the final threshold selection method (the fixed octave bands) can be deduced from the theoretical conclusions presented.
2.Regarding the FSCM Module: Appendix A.3, Eq. (18) introduces α as a learnable parameter, which functions as a weighting parameter for the upper and lower membership. Please elaborate on the specific design and implementation of this α parameter. We also suggest that the authors provide a comparison of the converged $\alpha$ values obtained from training on different datasets. This analysis would be helpful to determine if $\alpha$ possesses a degree of universality or if it is highly dataset-specific.

### Summary
This paper introduces a "Dual-domain reasoning" framework that integrates a Fuzzy Spatial Control Mechanism (FSCM) and a Frequency Adaptive Selection Mechanism (FASM) within a Mamba-based backbone to address the challenge of ambiguous boundaries in polyp segmentation.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a novel Dual-domain reasoning framework (FSFMamba) that effectively integrates spatial and frequency domains to tackle the problem of ambiguous boundaries in polyp segmentation.

The introduction of the Fuzzy Spatial Control Mechanism (FSCM) and Frequency Adaptive Selection Mechanism (FASM) demonstrates clear innovation FSCM models boundary uncertainty with interval type-2 Gaussian membership functions, while FASM adaptively weights frequency components to capture nuanced details.

The overall design using a Mamba-based backbone for cross-domain fusion is interesting and modern, allowing long-range interaction between spatial and spectral features.

Experimental validation is extensively evaluated on five benchmark datasets (CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS) and compared against 13 state-of-the-art methods using a comprehensive set of metrics (Dice, IoU, wFm, Sm, maxEm, MAE).

The ablation studies for submodules (FSCM, FASM, D2PM) are systematic, showing the contribution of each component and the overall improvement of the framework.

### Weaknesses
The mathematical formulation has ambiguities; several symbols (e.g., in Eq. 1) are undefined, and the gradient propagation for fuzzy membership functions lacks theoretical justification, especially given the non-smooth nature of fuzzy intervals.
The fusion strategy between spatial and frequency domains is empirically designed (simple concatenation) without rigorous theoretical backing or discussion on optimality.
The experiments lack targeted validation for the claimed strengths: there are no boundary-specific evaluations (e.g., boundary F-score) or experiments proving adaptive frequency learning through robustness tests like blur/noise interference.

### Questions
Novelty:
The novelty lies in the concurrent modeling of spatial uncertainty and spectral components. Specifically:
1. FSCM employs interval type-2 Gaussian membership functions to model boundary uncertainty as a flexible spatial band, moving beyond deterministic or simple fuzzy approaches.
2. FASM performs octave-wise spectral decomposition with learnable, spatially-adaptive weighting, aiming to capture subtle variations beyond simple high-low frequency splits.
3. The D2PM module integrates these two streams using a Mamba-based state-space block, promoting long-range interaction between the fuzzy spatial and selected frequency features.
The method is evaluated on five public datasets (CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, ETIS) and shows consistent improvement over 13 recent baselines, supporting the claim of improved boundary sharpness and generalization.

Methodology:
I have few questions in the methodology part:
1. The mathematical derivation of the FSCM module is relatively complete, and the upper and lower bound membership functions are defined as G^+ and G^-. Their forms conform to the general theoretical framework of the Gaussian fuzzy set.
The core formulation in the main text (Eq.~1) defines the basic Gaussian membership function, but the symbols are ambiguous (such as $R_i'$ and $\rho(\cdot)$ are not clearly defined).
2. It is not clear how the upper and lower bounds of fuzzy membership functions propagate gradients in spatial regular terms. There is a lack of feasibility explanation for closed-form gradient derivation or automatic differentiation. In theory, the backpropagation of fuzzy intervals is non-smooth, and the author does not explain how to stabilize training.
3. The FASM's frequency-domain operating formulas (Eq.~5–7) comply with the DFT definition and show no significant logical errors.
The main formula (Eq.6) uses a binary mask, but AppendixA.4 uses a smoothing mask (Eq.~22), leading to inconsistent theoretical descriptions. Although smoothing masks reduce artifacts, they have not been proven to be superior to binary masks, and the computational overhead is not discussed in the derivation.
4. The paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of how FSCM and FASM synergize. The fusion process in Eq.~8 is described as a simple concatenation followed by processing in a Mamba block. This design is empirically driven rather than theoretically motivated. There is no mathematical argument explaining why this specific fusion strategy is optimal for combining fuzzy spatial and adaptive frequency features.

The paper conducts extensive experiments using five standard datasets—CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, and ETIS to comprehensively cover mainstream benchmarks in polyp segmentation. It compares the proposed method against 13 recent state-of-the-art models, encompassing CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid, and baseline architectures. The evaluation employs a wide range of performance metrics, including Dice, IoU, wFm, Sm, maxEm, and MAE, forming a well-rounded indicator system. Through ablation studies, the FLFSC module is analyzed in configurations #1 to #4, demonstrating that its inclusion brings significant performance improvements. Additionally, submodule experiments (#5 to #7) are performed to isolate and assess the individual contributions of the FSCM, FASM, and D2PM components. Overall, while the experimental design is broad and systematic, it lacks targeted validation directly addressing the paper’s core claims.
1.  Lack of Boundary-Specific Evaluation: one of FSFMamba's core contributions is to deal with boundary ambiguity, but all evaluations use global metrics. Targeted evaluations in fuzzy boundary areas must be added, such as using the boundary F-score metric, and tested on a subset marked with boundary uncertainties to prove that the improvement in FSCM does come from the improvement in boundary areas.
2.  No Validation of Adaptive Frequency Selection: Experiments need to be designed to prove that FASM has indeed learned to adaptively select frequencies for different image content. It is recommended to add frequency interference experiments (such as applying different intensities of blur or noise) and demonstrate that FSFMamba is more robust than the baseline model.

The overall paper is well written, and core contributions are clearly stated in a bulleted list in the abstract and introduction. The motivation for the dual-domain approach is well-articulated.

1/ Grammar and Language: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and non-idiomatic expressions (e.g., sentence fragments like "The training process, executed on an NVIDIA A5000 GPU."), which detract from the paper's professionalism.
2/ Ambiguous Definitions: The function $\rho(\cdot)$ in Eq. (1) is vaguely described as "neighborhood normalization" but is never formally defined. The symbol  $R_i'$ is also unclear.
3/ Contextual Confusion: It is ambiguous whether the variable v in FSCM formulas represents the original pixel value or a deep feature. This must be explicitly stated.
4/ Line 32 (Organization) as a reference is irregular

### Summary
This paper introduces FSFMamba, a novel dual-domain network for polyp segmentation designed to address the challenges of ambiguous boundaries and complex background interference. The model operates in two domains simultaneously, the spatial domain and the spectral domain. The authors integrate two mechanisms (FSCM and FASM) into a Mamba-based backbone, which efficiently captures long-range dependencies. The authors conduct extensive experiments on five public image datasets and two video datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of FSFMamba.

### Strengths
- The primary strength of this paper is its novel integration of fuzzy logic for spatial uncertainty and adaptive selection for frequency-domain features.

- The FSCM is a well-motivated solution to the problem of ambiguous polyp boundaries. The model moves beyond simple boundary-aware losses and explicitly regularizes features in uncertain regions.

- The validation is strong. The model is benchmarked against 13 SOTA methods.

### Weaknesses
- The performance comparison in Figure 7 is hard to localize the superior of the proposed model. 

- In Figure 6, it would be better to add labels indicating whether higher or lower values of each metric are better; otherwise, this radar plot is somewhat counterintuitive.

- Figure 1 needs more description. The authors should provide further explanation of Figure 1(e) or establish a clearer connection between it and the proposed method (or demonstrating more visualization evidence).

- Although the model provides SOTA performance, there is no head-to-head comparison with Mamba-based polyp segmentation networks.
