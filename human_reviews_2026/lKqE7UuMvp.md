## Abstract
Inverse rendering with Gaussian Splatting has advanced rapidly, but accurately disentangling material properties from complex global illumination effects, particularly indirect illumination, remains a major challenge. Existing methods often query indirect radiance from Gaussian primitives pre-trained for novel-view synthesis. However, these pre-trained Gaussian primitives are supervised only towards limited training viewpoints, thus lack supervision for modeling indirect radiances from unobserved views. To address this issue, we introduce radiometric consistency, a novel physically-based constraint that provides supervision towards unobserved views by minimizing the residual between each Gaussian primitive’s learned radiance and its physically-based rendered counterpart. Minimizing the residual for unobserved views establishes a self-correcting feedback loop that provides supervision from both physically-based rendering and novel-view synthesis, enabling accurate modeling of inter-reflection.
We then propose Radiometrically Consistent Gaussian Surfels (RadioGS), an inverse rendering framework built upon our principle by efficiently integrating radiometric consistency by utilizing  Gaussian surfels and 2D Gaussian ray tracing. We further propose a finetuning-based relighting strategy that adapts Gaussian surfel radiances to new illuminations within minutes, achieving low rendering cost ($<$10ms). Extensive experiments on existing inverse rendering benchmarks show that RadioGS outperforms existing Gaussian-based methods in inverse rendering, while retaining the computational efficiency.

### Summary
The paper proposes a physically grounded inverse rendering framework called RadioGS. It introduces radiometric consistency, a physical constraint that enforces the agreement between each Gaussian surfel’s learned radiance and its physically-based rendered counterpart. This self-correcting mechanism provides supervision for unobserved views, enabling accurate modeling of indirect illumination and inter-reflections. Built on 2D Gaussian ray tracing, RadioGS integrates this constraint efficiently to improve decomposition of geometry, material, and lighting. Moreover, it includes a finetuning-based relighting strategy that adapts surfel radiances to new lighting conditions within minutes while maintaining real-time rendering speed (<10 ms). Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RadioGS achieves superior inverse rendering and relighting quality over previous Gaussian-based and NeRF-based methods

### Strengths
1. The introduction of radiometric consistency provides principled physical supervision for unobserved views.

2. The proposed finetuning-based relighting method allows adaptation to new lighting conditions within minutes, achieving high-quality results with less than 10 ms rendering time per frame.

3. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (TensoIR, Synthetic4Relight, Stanford-ORB) demonstrate superior performance in both inverse rendering and relighting tasks compared to prior Gaussian and NeRF-based methods.

### Weaknesses
1.The contribution may be limited in novelty, the proposed radiometric consistency mainly enforces agreement between the surfel’s learned radiance and its physically-based rendered results, which is a relatively straightforward physical constraint.

2.The relighting process requires additional finetuning under the proposed constraint, which introduces extra computation before rendering and reduces its advantage in fully real-time applications.

3.Although the paper claims that the finetuning stage improves both realism and efficiency of relighting, the experiments lack an ablation study that explicitly compares relighting quality with and without the finetuning stage and also the physically-based rendering component.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel inverse rendering framework, RadioGS, which better modeling the complex material-lighting interaction by utilizing a novel radiometric consistency loss. The proposed radiometric consistency loss are built on the 2D Gaussian Ray Tracing and enables more accurate indirect illumination querying. Experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, highlighting the effectiveness of the novel loss.

### Strengths
1. The paper propose a novel inverse rendering framework where 2DGRT are used to calculate the rendering equation and radiometric consistency loss, which achieve accurate inter-reflection modeling and material estimation

2. The proposed initialization and finetune-based relighting schemes further improve the inverse rendering and relighting performance.

3. Extensive experiments show that the method achieve best performance over inverse rendering baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed loss ensures the consistency between the surfel’s outgoing radiance and the PBR result. But it cannot promise that the outgoing radiance $L_G$ is correct in unseen direction. So I'm curious why it can improve the inverse rendering performance.
2. As we are talking about inverse rendering, so the material estimation should be more important than NVS. But according to the albedo PSNR shown in Fig.6, it seems that the performance gain comes more from NVS init. This will weaken the core contribution of the paper.

### Questions
1. What does the optimized envmap looklike, as the indirect illumination is more accurate, the estimated direct illumination should also be better.
2. Why can a simple finetune make the surfel’s outgoing radiance adopt to new lighting conditions? It sounds magic~

### Summary
This paper tackles the key problem of poor indirect illumination modeling in Gaussian Splatting-based inverse rendering. It proposes a physical constraint called radiometric consistency, designs an inverse rendering framework named RadioGS, and develops a fast finetuning-based relighting strategy. The radiometric consistency constraint provides supervision for unobserved viewpoints by minimizing the residual between the learned radiance of Gaussian surfels and their physically rendered radiance. This forms a self-correcting feedback loop. The RadioGS framework integrates 2D Gaussian ray tracing to deploy the constraint efficiently. The relighting strategy can adapt to new illumination conditions in minutes, with rendering latency below 10 ms. Experiments show the method outperforms existing Gaussian-based methods in novel view synthesis, geometry and material reconstruction, and relighting.

### Strengths
1. The paper is intuitive and easy to follow.
2. By combining the surfel radiance represented by spherical harmonics with physically based rendered radiance, the idea is straightforward and effective.
3. Through carefully designed loss functions, path tracing, and multi-stage training, the geometry reconstruction and inverse rendering have achieved superior results on multiple datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental validation is conducted exclusively at the object level, lacking evaluation on complex scene-level datasets. The scalability of the proposed framework to scene-level settings is a significant concern. The core Monte Carlo sampling strategy, which is computationally intensive even for objects, would likely incur a prohibitive overhead when applied to large-scale scenes with a massive number of Gaussian surfels.
2. The performance of the inverse rendering framework is dependent on the quality of a pre-trained novel view synthesis model, introducing a potential dependency and a point of failure.

### Questions
1. Scaling the method to scene-level settings presents primary challenges beyond the current object-centric experiments. Could the authors discuss the anticipated computational bottleneck in such a scenario? A detailed analysis of how the sampling parameters (e.g., N_g, N_s) and the associated rendering time are expected to scale would be crucial for assessing the method's practicality.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of inverse rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting, specifically focusing on the challenge of accurately modeling indirect illumination. Existing methods often struggle to disentangle material properties from global illumination effects because they lack supervision for indirect radiance from unobserved viewpoints. To this end, the paper proposes Radiometrically Consistent Gaussian Surfels (RadioGS), an inverse rendering framework that integrates radiometric consistency using 2D Gaussian ray tracing to efficiently compute indirect illumination and visibility.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks (TensoIR, Synthetic4Relight). The quantitative tables and qualitative figures (especially the superior handling of inter-reflections in Figures 1 and 5) convincingly show the benefits of the proposed approach over existing methods. The proposed finetuning-based relighting method is very fast (<10ms), making the framework practical for applications requiring real-time rendering under dynamic illumination.

### Weaknesses
1. A primary concern is the conceptual framing of "radiometric consistency". The paper presents this as a "novel physical constraint", but its fundamental distinction from standard methods for computing indirect illumination, such as path tracing, is unclear. The underlying physical constraint is simply the rendering equation. This method appears to be a form of optimization where a learned or cached representation of global illumination is regularized to match a physically-based render. If this interpretation is correct, then radiometric consistency is not a new physical principle but rather an efficient approximation or caching strategy designed to enforce it. The novelty would then lie in the caching technique itself, not the underlying physics.

2. The formulation of the indirect radiance term, $L_\text{ind}$, is critically underspecified. Despite being a cornerstone of the proposed method, the paper lacks a clear mathematical definition for how $L_\text{ind}$ is computed. The text refers readers to Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 (line 240), but this reference is confusing and unhelpful. Eq. 4 defines the BRDF, and Eq. 5 merely decomposes incoming radiance into direct and indirect components without providing a computational model for the latter. The method's implementation for this crucial term is left to textual descriptions (e.g., lines 240, 268), which is insufficient for a clear understanding and reproduction of the work.

3. The evidence supporting the central claim of improved indirect illumination modeling is indirect and appears weak. The paper validates its method via ablation studies on end-to-end metrics (e.g., NVS, albedo PSNR) across a limited set of scenes. However, these final metrics can be influenced by many factors in the rendering pipeline. Without a direct, quantitative evaluation of the indirect illumination component itself—for instance, by comparing the rendered indirect pass against a ground-truth path-traced equivalent—it is difficult to conclude that the performance gains stem specifically from more accurate indirect radiance estimation. Relying on proxy metrics from a small number of scenes makes the current conclusion insufficiently substantiated.

### Questions
1. See W1. Is the radiometric consistency a form of optimization where a learned or cached representation of global illumination is regularized to match a physically-based render?
2. What is the codebase for implementation? Currently, it seems that the method is built upon IRGS's implementation.
