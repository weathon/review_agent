## Abstract
Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery. We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations. Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various physical systems, such as Darcy flow and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the laws of physics.

### Summary
This paper presents an approach to enforcing symmetry constraints in symbolic PDE discovery. More specifically, the authors provide a Cramer’s rule type of constructive methodology to build higher order from lower order ones, a practical solution to real systems with imperfect symmetry, SI-relaxed, and ways to integrate the approach with multiple symbolic regression algorithms, more precisely sparse regression, genetic programming, and transformers, and demonstrates strong performance on three benchmarks.

### Strengths
The authors present Propositions 3.3-3.4 that provide a way to integrate symmetry constraints to symbolic regression, and also a relaxed constraint mechanism, which is useful in practical applications.

The experiments consider realistic cases of noise, imperfect symmetries, and it is useful that their method integrates with different approaches because one can consider the symbolic regression method that is most suitable for the problem at hand, for example Weak-SINDy for noisy data. The success criteria are also clear. 

The paper is well-written and the method is well communicated.

### Weaknesses
The practical significance of the approach is limited by the following weaknesses:

- There exist a different paper on the same subject following a similar approach called “ Governing Equation Discovery from Data Based on Differential Invariants” which is neither discussed not compared against. The authors should provide an explicit technical comparison, e.g. explain how assumptions differ, how invariant extraction differs, and how the linear-subspace approach allows for the use of weak SINDy. Right now the methodological overlap might strike to some readers as significant. I would also recommend discussing the technical similarities and how this paper differs from EquivSINDy. This way the novelty can be made more clear. 

- The paper argues that considering symmetries shrinks the search space and improves accuracy and efficiency. For many PDEs, a domain-expert can define a small, physics-consistent library (knowing the experimental setup makes very accurate educated guesses possible) without considering any symmetry. The study should include a realistically curated library that is symmetry agnostic but contains a physically plausible set of terms to measure the benefit of considering invariant instead of physical process knowledge. In practice practitioners consider exactly these types of libraries. 

- Table 1 reports the complexity, the success probability, and the error between the predicted and the baseline PDEs. In several tasks, the reduction of the complexity is small, only a few variables, yet the narrative is strongly mentions complexity reduction as the main motivation. The authors need to carefully quantify how much the complexity reduction relies on invariants compared to other factors such as better choice of dictionary or better LHS choice. Also, define C in the main text and not in the Appendix because it is important. 

- Some invariant contain terms that are operations between derivatives. The authors augment baselines with PySINDY* libraries, but you need to be careful because if invariants can be expressed with degree-2 monomials in $\eta$ while in the jet variable you require a degree-3 then the comparison favors the invariant basis by construction. This is precisely why an “expert” defined dictionary needs to be considered, because one can consider many irrelevant terms to blow up the dictionary of SINDy that are not related to the physical process for which we try to discover a PDE.

- For the Boussinesq equation, a filter $| u_x | < 0.1$ is considered. That is a reasonable choice, but it introduces a data-selection bias that may increase or decrease the probability of finding the correct PDE. The authors should perform a study of how different values of the threshold, e.g. (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3), affect the discovery and report the fraction of discarded samples. 


- The method assumes that the symmetry group is know and correct. This is acknowledged but the practical problem that discovering that full symmetry group from data is hard, and misspecification can result to the method braking down. The authors propose a relaxed approach for approximation, but there should a detailed study here. How wrong can a group selection be before the method collapses? Maybe they can run a sweep of different scenarios to provide some practical guidance. I also believe that the authors should consider symmetry braking due to forcing or BCs which is a major practical case. 

- The paper correctly states that any G-invariant PDE can be written purely in G-invariants. However this guarantees that the representation exists, it doesn’t guarantee that the representation is compact. In practice though an invariant algebra might require higher order generators or introduce expressions that a physics library wouldn’t so library size in the end might be comparable to the jet term library (see Table 1). The manuscript should discuss when the invariant set would be provably smaller and quantify the regime that reductions are substantial. 

- All three problems have nice symmetries, for example scaling and translations or SO(2). In this setting, some chosen invariants might be very close to the target structure, which makes the identification problem significantly easier than the jet and than the invariant in more complex regimens. 

- For me the invariant description is not interpretable meaning that if I know that a system contains diffusion or surface diffusion, I know which terms I need to include in the library, and how to prune it. Symmetry invariants are not as interpretable, unless you first start from the physics mechanisms and then define the invariants based on that. 

Overall I believe that this paper is mathematically elegant, but I am not convinced that it is useful in its current form.

### Questions
- What precisely is new compared to DI-SINDy and EquivSINDy?

- Please add a baseline where a carefully curated physics dictionary for SINDy is compared against the invariant library.

- Please answer the weakness above.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for discovering symbolic differential equations from data using symmetry invariants.
The authors argue that by employing the differential invariants of symmetry groups as fundamental variables in symbolic regression, the discovered equations can be guaranteed to satisfy specified symmetries, thereby narrowing the search space and improving discovery efficiency and accuracy.
The method is integrated into existing symbolic regression algorithms such as sparse regression (e.g., SINDy) and genetic programming, and is validated on several PDE systems (e.g., Boussinesq equation, Darcy flow, reaction-diffusion systems), demonstrating its robustness in the presence of noisy data and imperfect symmetries.

### Strengths
- From the perspective of differential invariants, this paper provides an efficient method for discovering PDEs when symmetries are known.

- The proposed method does not alter the existing symbolic regression framework except for the input variables, making it easy to implement.

- The experimental setting is reasonably comprehensive, including evaluations under noisy data and imperfect symmetry scenarios.

### Weaknesses
- Clarification of contributions. The methodology section of this paper is organized into four main components: the definition of symmetry invariants (Section 3.1), the computation of symmetry invariants (Section 3.2), the preprocessing of invariants as variables for the symbolic regression algorithm (Section 3.3), and the constraint relaxation for systems with imperfect symmetry (Section 3.4).
The framework largely builds upon existing techniques rather than introducing a substantially new theoretical formulation.
In particular, the approach for computing higher-order differential invariants is already well-established (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-0274-2 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05432v2);
yet the authors dedicate an entire section (Section 3.2) to this topic without appropriate citations or clarification of novelty, which makes it difficult for readers to identify the paper’s specific contributions.
In addition, recent studies (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03747
) have also explored the integration of symmetry and PDE discovery.
A more comprehensive discussion and comparison with these related works would help clarify how this paper advances beyond prior efforts.

- Non-uniqueness of fundamental invariants.
Even for the same symmetry group, a complete set of fundamental (ordinary) invariants is generally not unique.
Different derivation procedures or generator choices can lead to distinct but equivalent invariant forms.
In Appendix B.4, the authors directly state that the two ordinary invariants for SO(2) are $\tfrac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$ and $u$ without derivation.
While this choice is straightforward for simple symmetry groups, it becomes ambiguous for more complex transformations (see Chapter 2.4 of https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-0274-2 for more examples).
**If the selected invariants do not align with those appearing in the ground-truth PDE, the symbolic regression process may fail to recover the correct equation.**
Furthermore, differences in the derivation of ordinary invariants can propagate to the higher-order invariants computed via Proposition 3.3, which serve as meta-variables in SR methods, thereby introducing instability and inconsistency in more complex scenarios.

- The experimental section of the paper only considers common and relatively simple symmetry groups such as SO(2), scaling, and translation, which does not sufficiently validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
More importantly, the approach relies on a strong assumption—that explicit expressions for the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group are known in advance.
However, this requirement is difficult to satisfy in most real-world scenarios, as the Lie point symmetries of PDEs can have highly complex and nonlinear forms.
The authors mention in Section 5 that future work could integrate symmetry discovery methods, but most existing approaches involve neural network modules that are not analytically interpretable, making it impractical to obtain explicit generator expressions (e.g., the encoder–decoder in LaLiGAN (Yang et al., 2024) or the MLP used by Ko et al., 2024).
Consequently, it remains unclear whether the proposed method can genuinely facilitate the discovery of entirely unknown PDEs from data, rather than merely rediscovering toy examples already well understood by human experts.

- None of the experimental results include error bars or measures of variability, making it difficult to fully assess the reliability, robustness, and fairness of the reported findings.

- Inconsistency between theory, algorithm, and experiments.
Proposition 3.3 assumes the presence of only one prolonged vector field, which is quite limited and does not hold for more complex symmetry groups such as SO(3) or the Lorentz group that involve multiple generators.
In contrast, Algorithm 1 claims to take multiple infinitesimal generators $B={v_a}$ as input, creating a mismatch between the stated theoretical assumptions and the algorithmic design.
Moreover, Proposition 3.3 and Algorithm 1 define the dependent variable as one-dimensional, whereas Proposition 3.4 and the Reaction–Diffusion experiment involve multi-dimensional dependent variables.

- Minor issues.
(1) The paper should briefly explain the meaning of ordinary invariants when they are first introduced, to assist readers who are not familiar with the term.
(2) The subtitle Water Wave is inconsistent with the corresponding paragraph in the appendix and with the related figures and tables, which may cause confusion during reading.

### Questions
- For the Reaction-Diffusion equation, why does the method consider the SO(2) group acting on the dependent variables (u, v) rather than on the independent variables (x, y)? Where does this prior knowledge originate? In fact, for this system, the SO(2) symmetry on (x, y) is more general, while the SO(2) symmetry on (u, v) only holds when $d_1=d_2$—it is a case-specific condition.

- If the assumed symmetry is incorrect, to what extent does the proposed method fail? This will be an important issue when integrating the approach with symmetry discovery in future work.

- In the case of the 2D Navier–Stokes equations, how does the method handle the continuity constraint $\nabla \cdot u = 0$? How is the number of equations determined?

- How can discrete symmetries be incorporated into the proposed framework?

### Summary
This paper introduces a general framework to incorporate the differential invariants of partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from Lie symmetry theory into several prevailing symbolic regression methodologies. Experiments on several PDE systems and noise settings verify the effectiveness of the proposed symmetry invariants for more accurate, robust, and symmetry-consistent PDE discovery.

### Strengths
1. **Significance**: The paper focuses on compressing the vast and high-dimensional search space for PDEs, a central problem in existing PDE discovery methods.

2. **Clarity:** The paper has rigorous and well-defined notations and terminologies, with a concrete definition of the construction of differential invariants, algorithm 1 for explicit SR with invariants, and appendix samples/tables making the pipeline replicable and interpretable.

3. **Adaptive Design to Several Baselines:** Adapt symmetry invariants into the major baselines (SINDy, GP, and Transformer), making the proposed method flexible to different problem settings, and showing a consistent improvement for accuracy and the complexity management capability among those baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. **Lack of Statistical Significance**: The paper claims the Table 1 results are based on 100 runs for each algorithm; however, only the median of PE is reported. A confidential interval can strengthen the statistical significance of the results.

2. **Lack of Computational Efficiency Analysis**:  The paper claims in line 21 that the proposed approach can "improve their (sparse regression's and genetic programming's) accuracy and *efficiency*." However, only accuracies (SP and PE) are reported in Table 1 and Figure 3. There is no efficiency analysis, such as running time or search space size benchmarking for the experiments in the main context, to support the claim.

### Questions
1. For higher $p,n$, the count of derivatives explodes. What is the computational complexity (symbolic time) of producing invariants via $\text{pr}^{(n)}v(\eta)=0$ and the Prop. 3.3 recursion? Any timings and symmetry invariant size for your three PDEs in Table 1?

2. Algorithm 1 tries each invariant as LHS and picks the lowest relative error. How do you mitigate scale effects or overfitting to noise in this selection?

### Summary
This work proposes a framework for incorporating known physical symmetries in the process of PDE equation discovery via symbolic regression (SR) from data. The central idea is to leverage the mathematical theory of Lie groups and differential invariants to enhance the symbolic regression algorithms. These invariants are functions of the original variables (and their derivatives) that by definition remain unchanged under the symmetry transformations, hence the resulting discovered equation is guaranteed to respect these symmetries by construction, and are more easily discovered. The authors further test this approach by integrating it with three of the main classes of SR (SINDy, PySR, and symbolic transformers), showing improvements in success rates and predictions on three canonical PDE systems.

Although the paper has a novel approach to enforce symmetries in data for the challenging task of SR, is very well written and clear, with an extensive appendix and well-documetned code, its novelty and experimental evaluations are limited. Most of the presented theory is based on Olver (1993), and in practice their method is effective on a few specific cases (ref. Tab 1). Most notably, this approach requires that the symmetry group is already given and differential invariants have to be computed and adapted to the SR methods (when feasible). These limitations are discussed briefly only at the end of Sec. 5, but I believe this should be clearly stated earlier in the presentation.
This work deserves attention from the ML community, and while this venue may not be the most appropriate (even due to its page limit), this line of research is worth more investigation and discussion. Also, the contribution on the computation of high-order differential invariant (Prop 3.3) may be worth a standalone publication in a mathematical venue or journal.
Finally, I am willing to discuss with the authors, AC and other reviewers, and reconsider my evaluation.

### Strengths
This paper is well-writen and mathematically elegant. The main strengths are:
- Its primary contribution, of integrating symmetry via differential invariants, is a sound and rigorous approach based in established mathematical theory.
- This framework is presented as an "enhancement" that can be applied to the main SR methods, making this contribution potentially more impactful.
- Within the context of the chosen experimental settings, the methods show remarkable effectiveness compared to the baselines. There are also studies that address noisy conditions and imperfect symmetries, amenable for real-world cases.
- Clear Figures, Proofs, reproducible code, and a broad, extended appendix further improve the quality and soundness of this scientific work as a whole.

### Weaknesses
Despite the strengths, the paper suffers from significant limitations in its core assumptions, novelty, and experimental scope, which are not given sufficient weight in the main body of the text.

-  The most critical weakness is the core assumption that the symmetry group of the PDE is known a priori. The paper positions itself as a tool for equation discovery, but, as stated, in many scientific discovery scenarios the underlying symmetries are unknown and are part of what needs to be discovered. Besides all the benchmarks and comparisons that are necessary, it would have been more interesting to address this issue and limitation. Experimental tests on black-box, symbolic-unknown real-world dataset on which some symmetries are assumed would highly showcase the effectiveness of this approach, and broaden its impact.
- While the application of this approach to a broad set of SR methods is a solid contribution to the ML community, the core conceptual idea of using symmetries is a standard approach in theoretical physics. The math presented in Sec 3.1 also belongs to the Background and is not novel; the noteworthy mathematical contributions are Prop 3.3 and 3.4, and in practice there are some limitations (could you elaborate on line 248 "We evaluate invariants on the dataset only where they are well-defined"?). The paper's claim to be "the first attempt to strictly enforce general symmetries [...] for general symbolic regression methods" (lines 759) hinges heavily on the word "general." The conceptual leap seems less significant than presented, and the work can be viewed as an incremental, yet valuable, extension of prior ideas into a broader software framework.
- The paper significantly downplays the practical difficulty of deriving the differential invariants. The authors state that solving for invariants "is easy with any symbolic computation package" but later concede that the results "may be complicated and require ad-hoc adjustment for better interpretability and compatibility" (lines 481-484). This "one-time effort" can be extremely non-trivial for complex symmetries or high-dimensional systems, requiring substantial domain expertise. This represents a major "pre-processing" step that acts as a significant barrier to entry for practitioners, and undermines the goal of automated equation discovery.
- Lastly, the experimental setting, while clean, is limited in scope and does not convincingly demonstrate robustness for real-world challenges or more complex systems.

Minor comments that did not affect the score:
- The compared baseline methods, although established in the literature, have known limitations, and other more powerful algorithms are available. See SR Bench (https://cavalab.org/srbench/) or TPSR (Shojaee 2023) instead of E2E. 
- Error estimates on your results are missing, making the comparison of the results less valuable. You could use a simple bootstrap of median values as an approximation of median values, or report histograms of the outcomes.
- For clarity, Appendix D and E should be reversed, as they appear in that order in the text.
- There are some arXiv references, which should be avoided as they are not peer-reviewed. Refer to peer-reviewed venues instead (if applicable).

### Questions
- Could you quantify the human effort involved in deriving and "adjusting" the invariants for a system? What about when the invariants become so complex to be uninterpretable, thus negating the benefit of symbolic regression?
- Algorithm 1 proposes iterating through each invariant to serve as LHS and selecting the one that minimizes regression error. This seems computationally intensive and potentially non-physical. Could this approach not lead to discovering a mathematically valid but physically meaningless rearrangement of the true equation (like expressing $u$ as a complex function of $u_t$ and $u_xx$)?
- For the imperfect symmetry experiments, how is the regularization strength on the symmetry-breaking terms chosen ($d_1$ and $d_2$)? These are sensitive hyperparameters that would require careful tuning on a validation set, potentially limiting the method's utility when ground truth is unavailable.
- How is the "specific timestep" of the computation of the prediction errors (PE) chosen?
- Could you elaborate on the choice of median RMSE instead of averages due to "tremendous prediction errors"? Are these outliers vaues, or happen more frequently? Histograms of these estimates could further convey the effectiveness of the method, since it has a success probability >54% (when applicable). 
- Concerning GP and Appx. D2, why did you set up to 15 iterations for Boussinesq, and hundreds for the other cases? Considering that the default is 100 and performance was already on par with SI at 15. Do you have any intuition why PySR fails completely on Darcy and RD?
- Is there a reason why you picked RD and SINDy for the experiments in 4.4, while not investigating the Boussinesq case with noisy data and other baselines? As you also mentioned, SINDy is not the best approach when dealing noisy data. Additionally, in the Boussinesq experiment, the baseline PySINDy fails because its default library lacks the necessary terms, but a modified PySINDy* with said terms succeeds perfectly (Table 3 in the appendix). This suggests the baseline's failure is one of library design, not a fundamental flaw. The key advantage of the invariant method is that it "automates" the creation of a correct library, and this point should be made more transparent, rather than presenting a 0% vs. 100% success rate against a limited baseline (Table 1 in the main text).
