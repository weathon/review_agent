# Analyzing Time-independent Classifiers for Conditional Generation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 4

## Abstract
Classifier guidance diffusion models have advanced conditional image generation by training a **time-dependent** classifier on noisy data from every diffusion timestep to guide denoising process. We revisit this paradigm and show that such dense guidance is unnecessary: a small set of **time-independent** classifiers, trained on data from selected timesteps, suffices to produce high-quality, class-consistent samples. Theoretically, we first analyze the feasibility of using a single time-independent classifier trained on clean data to guide generation under certain conditions which are unrealistic in practice. To address the limitations of real-world image data, we then extend this approach to a small set of classifiers trained on noisy data from some timesteps and derive a convergence bound that depends on the number of classifiers employed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that guiding an unconditional diffusion model with only a few time-independent classifiers achieves performance comparable to models guided by a fully time-dependent classifier.

### Summary
This paper investigates the necessity of time-dependent classifiers in classifier guidance for conditional generation with diffusion models. The authors theoretically and empirically show that, under certain conditions, guiding diffusion sampling with a single time-independent classifier, or a small number of such classifiers trained on data at different noise levels, can achieve sample quality comparable to the standard approach that uses a full time-dependent classifier. The work provides theoretical convergence guarantees, proposes a refined multi-classifier approach practical for real-world data manifolds, and backs claims with experiments on both synthetic low-dimensional data and large-scale image datasets.

### Strengths
- **Strong Theoretical Analysis:** The paper offers thorough mathematical treatment of both the feasibility and limitations of time-independent classifier guidance, including explicit proofs. Notably, the contractive property of the reverse process with a strongly log-concave classifier is both formally and intuitively described.
- **Algorithmic Innovation:** The proposed strategy of using a small set of time-independent classifiers addresses a significant computational bottleneck in existing classifier guidance methods, with the transition dynamics rigorously constructed and justified.
- **Clear Empirical Evaluation:** Comprehensive and comparative experiments are conducted on both toy and real-world datasets. Figure 3 demonstrates clear visual improvements in sample quality as the number of classifiers increases, and Table 1  provides direct quantitative support: even 8 classifiers approach the FID/sFID of 1000-classifier guidance.
- **Relevance and Impact:** The work provides actionable insight for improving the efficiency and scalability of classifier-guided diffusion models, which is a topic of considerable interest in generative modeling.
- **Clarity in Exposition:** The paper is well structured with a clear flow from theoretical motivation, through algorithmic proposal, to empirical validation. Mathematical notation is generally consistent, and practical implications are repeatedly emphasized.

### Weaknesses
1. **Potential Overstatement on Real-World Applicability of Single Classifier Guidance:** Theoretically, the feasibility of using a single time-independent classifier depends critically on strong log-concavity and the ability to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}; 0, I)p_0(y \mid \mathbf{x})$, which is not realistic for high-dimensional natural images. Although the authors acknowledge this, empirical validation on real-world data is only performed for the multi-classifier regime. There is a substantial gap between theory and practice unaddressed for the single-classifier setting.
2. **Missing or Limited Comparison to Related Alternative Guidance Approaches:** While classifier-free guidance is briefly mentioned, there is insufficient experimental or conceptual comparison, especially given classifier-free guidance’s considerable practical importance. For instance, Table 1 and Table 2 compare only varying counts of time-dependent classifiers and lack strong baselines from other guidance paradigms.
3. **Empirical Evidence for Robustness to Classifier and Data Bias:** Experiments such as those visualized in Figures 9, 10, and 11 focus on varying guidance strength and initial distribution bias, but they predominantly demonstrate results for a handful of selected classes. The breadth and depth of robustness testing are not thoroughly quantified.
4. **Limited Discussion of Limitations and Potential Failure Modes:** The discussion lightly touches on the failure of single-classifier guidance for manifold data, but does not explore or visualize where/why this approach might entirely fail for more complex datasets or tasks (e.g., text-to-image, compositionality, or classes with high inter-class visual similarity). Similarly, sensitivity to classifier architecture and capacity is not explored.
5. **Insufficient Empirical Comparison with Robust/Adversarial Guidance:** Recent works such as Kawar et al. (2023), which explore the robustness of classifier-guided diffusion via adversarial training, are not discussed or compared in depth. Such comparisons could reveal whether the proposed approach has complementary or inferior/robustness properties.

### Questions
- How does the approach perform when the noise level/timestep selection for classifier training is heavily skewed (e.g., all classifiers from early or late timesteps)? Is uniform selection optimal, or might adaptive selection perform better?
- Can the authors more rigorously quantify the robustness of the method to misspecification of the classifier(s) or class imbalance, both theoretically and empirically?
- Is there any scenario (e.g., compositional generation, text-to-image tasks) where the saturation with 8-16 classifiers no longer holds? Can the approach handle such settings, or is it fundamentally limited to simple class-conditional tasks?
- How would the method compare, practically and in terms of efficiency/quality, to classifier-free guidance or adversarially robust classifier guidance approaches? A small ablation or discussion on this point could substantially strengthen the story.
- What is the computational overhead or memory reduction in practical training settings (e.g., on larger-scale or resource-constrained problems) for various values of $k$? Is there a practical lower bound for $k$ where gains taper off or instability emerges?

### Summary
This paper tackles the high computational cost of classifier-guided diffusion models (CGDM). Traditional CGDM requires a classifier at every diffusion step. The authors argue this dense guidance is unnecessary.
They propose a more efficient method. Their approach uses a small set (k) of time-independent classifiers. Each classifier is trained on data from only a few selected timesteps. The authors provide a theoretical bound showing the error scales as O(1/k).
Experiments on ImageNet-1K show the sparse approach (e.g., k=8) achieves similar sample quality to the traditional method.

### Strengths
The paper is well-organized and provides sufficient theoretical justification. The authors begin by discussing the ideal case of a single classifier and highlight its limitations, which naturally leads to the proposed solution of using multiple classifiers.
The technical details, including the introduction of a new transition probability, the analysis of the contractive property, and the O(1/k) convergence bound, are presented clearly, offering strong support for the method within the CGDM framework. Additionally, the experimental results on ImageNet strongly support the central claim, showing that significant efficiency improvements can be achieved by reducing the number of classifiers from T to k without a notable loss in performance.

### Weaknesses
1.A key weakness is that the paper's contribution is narrowly focused on the traditional CGDM. This is a limitation because the research community has largely shifted towards Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). CFG was introduced specifically to avoid the high cost of external classifiers—the very problem this paper attempts to mitigate. Consequently, the paper primarily addresses a challenge that the current, dominant paradigm was designed to circumvent entirely, which may limit the practical significance of its contribution.  

2.the paper lacks an experimental comparison with a CFG baseline. While it demonstrates that sparse CGDM is more efficient than dense CGDM, it does not compare it to the widely used CFG method. Without such a comparison, it is difficult to assess the practicality and competitiveness of the proposed approach.  

3.In Table 2, the k=10 model for CIFAR-10 (7.36 FID) significantly outperforms the k=1000 baseline (19.36 FID), while also using fewer training iterations (30k vs. 100k). This result seems counter-intuitive and contradicts the performance observed on ImageNet, suggesting that the baseline model may not have been adequately trained, thus weakening the credibility of the paper's experimental results.

### Questions
1.Given the widespread use of CFG in the generation field, I encourage the authors to elaborate on the motivation for optimizing the CGDM framework. Are there specific scenarios where sparse CGDM offers a distinct advantage?  

2.A quantitative comparison with a CFG-based baseline would help demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in practical scenarios.  

3.Additional clarification on the CIFAR-10 results in Table 2 would be helpful. Could the authors explain the large performance gap between the k=10 and k=1000 models? Considering the differing number of training iterations, would it be necessary to further discuss the fairness of the baseline?

### Summary
This paper was analyzing time-independent classifiers for conditional generation and proposed interesting methods. However, several aspects of the paper could be strengthened, particularly in terms of experimental completeness and comparison with classifier-free guidance methods.

### Strengths
The paper presents an interesting and theoretically grounded approach to improve the efficiency of classifier-guided diffusion models by replacing time-dependent classifiers with a small set of time-independent classifiers. 
The authors provide solid theoretical analysis, including the feasibility of using a single time-independent classifier trained on clean data and the bounds on convergence. This theoretical framework adds credibility to the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
The experiment is insufficient:
1. While the paper discusses classifier-free guidance in the related work, no experimental comparison is provided. Since classifier-free guidance is now a widely adopted alternative that also aims to reduce the dependency on explicit classifiers, it is crucial to evaluate the proposed method against it in terms of generation quality, computational efficiency, and scalability. 
2. The paper claims that a small number of classifiers trained at selected timesteps suffice for high-quality generation. However, the criteria for selecting these timesteps and their impact on performance are not discussed. 
3. Relying solely on quantitative metrics such as FID and sFID may not fully capture perceptual quality. Incorporating additional perceptual metrics (e.g., LPIPS, CLIPScore) and a user study would provide more holistic evidence of visual realism and human-perceived quality.
4. The paper repeatedly emphasizes computational efficiency, yet no explicit runtime or FLOPs analysis is provided. It would be highly beneficial to include a comparison table. eg.Training and inference time for different numbers of classifiers and memory and computational cost.
5. The theoretical results rely on the assumption that the classifier is strongly log-concave. The authors themselves acknowledge (L267–269) that this assumption does not hold in practice for complex neural classifiers. Hence, more empirical evidence on larger, real-world datasets is needed to show that the proposed method still performs robustly even when classifiers are non-convex.
