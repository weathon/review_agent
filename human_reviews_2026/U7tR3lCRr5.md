# A Scalable Inter-edge Correlation Modeling in CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

### Summary
This study proposes CopulaLSP, which employs a Gaussian copula to couple the marginal relaxed Bernoulli distributions with the correlation structure derived from the Gramian matrix of edge embeddings. It introduces the Woodbury reformulation to maximize the spatiotemporal efficiency of sampling-based inference and theoretically validates the rapid convergence of the method.

### Strengths
The study features rigorous theoretical analysis, supplemented by visual illustrations to elucidate parameter functions. The integration of theoretical and visual elements ensures clarity in demonstrating methodological robustness and practical applicability.

### Weaknesses
The study exhibits an excessive emphasis on theoretical analysis, while the experimental section appears somewhat rudimentary, lacking in-depth investigation into the configuration of hyperparameters.

### Questions
1.When using the Woodbury reformulation for matrix inversion, how stable is the inversion process when the embedding dimension is large?
2.To what extent does the setting of the label softening parameter ηimpact model performance, particularly convergence speed? While the appendix mentions a hyperparameter study, the main text lacks a sensitivity analysis of η.

### Summary
This paper introduces CopulaLSP, a scalable framework for link sign prediction in signed graphs. Based on the assumption of statistical dependencies between edges, this paper overcomes the inability of traditional GNNs to handle negative edges, extending the architecture from unsigned graphs to signed graphs. It uses a Gramian of lower-dimensional edge embeddings to model the correlation between edges, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and memory consumption. Furthermore, it reformulates the conditional probability distribution using the Woodbury matrix identity, transforming the matrix inversion required during inference into the inversion of a smaller matrix, significantly reducing computational cost. The proposed method is proven to have linear convergence.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes an innovative hypothesis that there exists a statistical dependence between edges connected by common nodes, thus extending GNNs from unsigned to signed graphs.

2. By introducing a Gramian-based correlation matrix for edge dependencies and a Woodbury matrix rewrite for computational efficiency, the paper significantly reduces memory usage and computational cost, greatly accelerates model convergence, and achieves good scalability while maintaining performance comparable to baseline models.

3. The paper provides rigorous mathematical support for its core claims through numerous mathematical derivations.

4. Ablation experiments on the two core components demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

5. The paper has a clear and well-organized structure, with distinct separation of different components.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper contains a large number of mathematical formulas, which makes it somewhat difficult to read.

2. The innovation of the framework mainly relies on the creative combination of existing tools (Gaussian Copula, Gramian construction, and the Woodbury identity), lacking some novelty.

3. Model training depends on hyperparameters η and ε, making it difficult to directly obtain optimal model performance.

4. Section 4 spends some length analyzing the model's convergence, which is not directly related to the main logic of the paper.

5. The method only uses SNEA as the backbone encoder, which raises questions about its generalizability.

6. Time and memory efficiency comparison is a key indicator for assessing the performance of the method, but the paper only provides comparisons with SNEA, making the experimental results less persuasive.

### Questions
1. Is the method insensitive to the backbone encoder?

### Summary
The paper proposes CopulaGNN for Link Sign Prediction (CopulaLSP). It builds on the prior work CopulaGNN for the task of node regression, the core idea of which is the model dependencies between nodes by learning a Gaussian copula. Here the model must instead learn correlations between edges, which is intractable with a naïve approach, so the authors propose two ideas to deal with this. First, the correlation matrix is parametrized as the Gramian of edge embeddings (which are learned with a prior GNN model for signed graphs, SNEA). Second, a Woodbury matrix identity is used to transform the inference-time inversion of a matrix of the size of the number of observed edges, to the inversion of the matrix of the size of the embedding dimension. Furthermore, the authors prove that their approach converges linearly. Finally, the method is evaluated against other recent methods on 4 real-world datasets, showing competitive prediction performance and faster convergence.

### Strengths
- The paper has a clear and significant narrative: It considers the natural approach of edge-edge correlation modeling, which has some general relevance in graph modeling, identifies the scalability problem, and provides a solution.
- The writing is clear and grammatical. The diagram of Figure 1 is helpful for understanding the core concepts.
- The paper includes conceptual, theoretical, and experimental components.
- Several ablations are provided to strengthen the paper's claims.

### Weaknesses
- The method is competitive with others in terms of prediction performance, but not clearly superior and arguably inferior to one other method on the chosen datasets.
- The diversity of the datasets is limited, with two Bitcoin datasets and two Wikipedia datasets. 
- There is little discussion of how the prior methods work, including SNEA, which is used as the encoder backbone in this paper.
- There is little discussion of the modeling side of the proposed approach, e.g., what do the learned embeddings, linear projection, and Gramian look like, on real or toy data?
- The convergence result is welcome, but it seems to simply be an application of a prior result to the proposed loss function. I would favor more space in the main body of the paper on the prior two points.

### Questions
- A "relaxed Bernoulli distribution" is defined in Eq. 6 as a continuous analog of the Bernoulli distribution. Has this distribution been studied before? Why are other, more commonly-used distributions on $(0,1)$, like the beta distribution, not suitable?
- Have you evaluated using the graph Laplacian of the line graph for edge correlations, as an analog to use of the graph Laplacian itself in CopulaGNN?
- The question about the modeling side of the approach above.
- How does CopulaLSP work with other backbones than SNEA? What is preventing applying the CopulaLSP on top of the strongest prior method, SLGNN? Relatedly, what would be the performance if dropping the GNN encoder backbones and learning a simpler encoder (e.g., just a linear transformation or MLP of the node features, or directly learning node embeddings if there are no node features)?

### Summary
The authors study a problem of graph learning on signed graph, where existing GNNs struggle due to the homophily assumption. Thus, the authors borrow the idea from CopulaGNN. However, directly applying CopulaGNN is not applicable due to computational limitations. Two main ideas were introduced to tackle the limitations. First, (at the training phase) the correlation matrix is constructed as a Gramian of edge embeddings, which dramatically reduces the number of parameters. Second, the conditional probability distribution has been reformulated for reducing the inference cost. Experimental results show how CopulaLSP achieves significant reductions in computation time while maintaining the predictive performances from competitive models.

### Strengths
- The main problem/ task is one of the important topic in GNN. The problem formulation (in Section 2) is clear. The paper is well organized and relevant theorem has been provided to support the statements.  
- The main idea: using the CopulaGNN for signed graph learning has been well justified theoretically. The idea of reducing the computational cost in two ways: training phase and inference phase, is straightforward and supported well. 
- For the experimental results, the computational reduction, both in time and memory, is significant. Ablation study was conducted thoroughly, which supports the efficacy of CopulaLSP.

### Weaknesses
- Some of the details are missing requiring further clarifications.(see questions)  
- How does the low-rank multivariate Gaussian brings, in what extent, how significant ? The authors simply state that Woodbury reformulation is used to improve computational efficiency.  
- The proposed model uses SNEA as their backbone and show the improvements in computational efficiency. However, from practical point, considering that the best prediction performances are achieved among TrustSGCN, SLGNN, further computational comparison in the Appendix can be added in Section 5. In some sense, the achievement (437 times faster convergence than baseline) can be viewed as an overstatement considering that the baseline is SNEA.

### Questions
Q1. The notion of missing edges can be further clarified. In conventional GNN or in graph learning models, missing edges refer to unobserved relationships. 

Q2. I wonder how their ‘label softening’ is different from ‘label smoothing’ which is well-established term. 

Q3. Can you further elaborate why the correlation matrix should satisfy the condition in line 180-181? It is unclear why this condition should be added supposedly matrix R is the same from line 127-128 which is directly borrowed from CopulaGNN.
