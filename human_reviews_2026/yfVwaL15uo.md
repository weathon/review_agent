- Decision: Accept (Poster)

## Abstract
Multi-view clustering seeks to exploit complementary information across different views to enhance clustering performance, where both semantic and structural information are crucial. However, existing approaches often bias toward one type of information while treating the other as auxiliary, overlooking that the reliability of these signals may vary across datasets and that semantic and structural cues can provide complementary and parallel guidance. As a result, such methods may face limitations in generalization and suboptimal clustering performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Dual-branch Representations with dynamic gatEd fusion and triple-grAnularity alignMent (DREAM), for deep multi-view clustering. Specifically, DREAM disentangles semantic information via a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) branch, while simultaneously captures structure-aware features through a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) branch. The resulting representations are dynamically integrated using a gated fusion module that leverages structural cues as complementary guidance, adaptively balancing semantic and structural contributions to produce clustering-oriented latent embeddings. To further improve robustness and discriminability, we introduce a triple-granularity feature alignment mechanism that enforces consistency across views, within individual samples, and intra-cluster, thereby preserving semantic-structural coherence while enhancing inter-cluster separability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DREAM significantly outperforms SOTA approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of disentangled dual-branch encoding, adaptive gated fusion, and triple-granularity feature alignment.

### Summary
The paper proposes DREAM, a deep multi-view clustering framework that jointly exploits semantic and structural information. DREAM disentangles semantic features via a VAE branch and captures structure-aware representations via a GCN branch, dynamically integrating them through a gated fusion mechanism that adaptively balances their contributions. Moreover, a triple-granularity alignment strategy enforces consistency across views, samples, and clusters, enhancing robustness and discriminability.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a dual-branch disentanglement module that explicitly separates semantic and structural information via dedicated encoders—a VAE for semantics and a GCN for structure—allowing the model to capture heterogeneous information in a complementary manner. This is an interesting and potentially valuable idea.
2. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches.
3. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of each module in the proposed model.

### Weaknesses
1. Some parts of the model description are unclear; for example, the value of $\lambda_1$ in Equation (3) is not provided.
2. The Feature Alignment Module is one of the innovations of the paper; however, the description of the Overall Feature Alignment Loss is not sufficiently clear. In Equation (10), both $L_{\text{Semantic}}$ and $L_{\text{Structure}}$ share the same hyperparameter $\lambda_2$, but it is unclear why they are set equal. In addition, $L_{\text{intra}}$ and $L_{\text{inter}}$ do not have any hyperparameters, and the rationale for this choice is not explained.
3. The manuscript refers to a "Cross-View Weighting" mechanism within the Gated Feature Fusion Module. Nevertheless, it is not evident how the cross-view component is realized, as Equation (7) does not explicitly reflect any cross-view fusion process. The authors are encouraged to clarify this implementation detail.
4. The manuscript contains formatting issues; for example, a line break occurs at lines 458--459.

### Summary
The manuscript proposes a multi-view clustering method that explicitly leverages both semantic and structural representations. The approach first disentangles semantic and structure-aware features using a dual-branch architecture and then adaptively integrates them through a gated fusion mechanism. To further enhance robustness and inter-cluster separability, a triple-granularity feature alignment strategy is applied across views, samples, and clusters. The manuscript also presents extensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The manuscript is well written, and the overall structure is logically organized.

2. The proposed method effectively enhances performance by jointly exploring multi-view semantic and structural information, performing cross-view fusion, and introducing multi-level alignment strategies to fully exploit the rich information across views.

3. The experimental section includes both performance comparisons and visualization analyses, which effectively validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
1. The flowchart suggests that pseudo-label information is incorporated into the framework. However, the manuscript does not clearly explain how these pseudo labels are generated or what specific role they play in the learning process. The authors should clarify the source of the pseudo labels and elaborate on how they contribute to model optimization and clustering performance.

2. In the Inter-Cluster Alignment loss, the roles of (a, p, n) are not sufficiently clarified. Their specific definitions and underlying physical interpretations should be explicitly described.

3. Apart from the balancing parameter in the model, the descriptions of other hyperparameter settings are insufficient. It remains unclear whether these parameters are kept consistent across datasets, how their values are determined, and whether the comparisons with baseline methods are conducted under fair and comparable conditions.

4. The experimental section would benefit from a convergence analysis.

### Summary
This work addresses the challenge of effectively integrating semantic and structural information in multi-view clustering, where existing methods often emphasize one type of information while neglecting the other. To tackle this, the authors propose a dual-branch design (a VAE branch for semantic representations and a GCN branch for structure-aware features) to disentangle the two types of information and adaptively fuse them via a gated mechanism. Additionally, a triple-granularity feature alignment strategy is introduced to enforce consistency across views, samples, and clusters, enabling the model to learn clustering-friendly feature representations and improve clustering performance.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method introduces a novel feature disentanglement and cross-view fusion strategy, explicitly modeling the rich and complementary information in multi-view data.

2. The introduction clearly motivates the proposed approach, and the cited references are representative and sufficiently comprehensive.

3. The workflow diagram provided in the manuscript is clear and readable, aiding in the understanding of the method.

### Weaknesses
1. In Equation (4), the method for initializing the graph structures is not specified; it is unclear how the "Initialize graph structures" step is performed. Furthermore, the manuscript does not discuss how different graph construction methods affect the model’s performance.

2. There are inconsistencies in the coefficients: Equation (1) uses $1/N$, whereas Equation (4) uses $1/N^2$, and the mechanism for determining these coefficients is not explained. A similar inconsistency appears in the two forms of Equation (9). Additionally, $N$ is not defined.

3. The explanation of Equation (10) is unclear and difficult to understand.

4. The presentation of the Ablation Studies section lacks clear organization and logical flow. It is recommended that the authors further refine and polish this section to improve readability and coherence.

### Questions
In Equation (5), the overall encoding loss combines semantic and structural components. Why are their contributions considered equally important? Shouldn’t there be a hyperparameter to balance them?

### Summary
The paper develops a multi-view clustering framework based on a dual-branch representation that simultaneously captures semantic and structural information from multiple views. It employs a gated fusion module that adaptively balances the contributions of semantic and structural features according to the characteristics of the data, producing latent representations more suitable for clustering. In addition, the authors introduce a triple-granularity feature alignment mechanism to enforce consistency at three levels. This design enhances the coherence between semantic and structural information while improving inter-cluster separability.

### Strengths
1.The developed framework systematically tackles imbalanced integration of semantic and structural information, conflicts in feature fusion, and limited feature alignment, providing a well-motivated solution to longstanding issues in deep MVC.
2.The paper’s division of multi-view clustering methods into semantics- and structure-oriented categories is insightful, highlighting the need to jointly leverage both information types.

### Weaknesses
1.The rationale for using structural cues in the gated fusion module as complementary guidance for cross-view embedding fusion is unclear. Clarification with semantic-guided fusion would be beneficial.
2.Some acronyms, such as VAE and GCN, are introduced without explanation. Providing their full names on first mention would improve clarity.
3.Certain modules in Figure 1 are not fully described, making it difficult to understand their exact functionality.
4.Regarding the graph reconstruction loss, which minimizes the mean squared error between predicted and ground-truth adjacency matrices, it is not explained whether using the ground-truth adjacency directly would suffice. If so, the role of the GCN encoder requires further justification.
5.Both Equation (3) and Equation (14) involve KL divergence, but the distinction between them is not clearly explained.
6.In the experiments, it would be helpful to include references or links for the datasets used to enhance reproducibility.
