- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 4, 6, 2, 4

## Abstract
Recent advances in LLMs-based agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks. Nevertheless, current protocols (e.g., A2A and MCP) suffer from insufficient capabilities in context management, limited adaptability to diverse environments, and the absence of dynamic agent architectures. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{Tool-Environment-Agent} (TEA) Protocol, which establishes a principled basis for integrating environments, agents, and tools into an unified system. The TEA protocol treats environments and agents as first-class resources, enabling comprehensive context management and adaptive environment integration. Based on this protocol, we introduce AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and coordinates specialized agents. Each sub-agent is dedicated to specific functions, providing capabilities for data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning. Notably, AgentOrchestra introduces a tool manager agent that supports intelligent evolution through dynamic tool creation, retrieval, and reuse mechanisms. Experiments on three widely used benchmarks show that AgentOrchestra consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 83.39\% on GAIA and ranking among the top general-purpose LLM-based agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of the TEA Protocol and hierarchical organization in building general-purpose multi-agent systems.

### Summary
This paper introduces the TEA Protocol, a unified framework that integrates environments, agents, and tools into a cohesive system. As an instantiation of the TEA Protocol, the authors present AGENTORCHESTRA, a hierarchical multi-agent framework featuring a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and coordinates specialized sub-agents to execute them.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces three core protocols, including TCP (Tool Context Protocol), ECP (Environment Context Protocol), and ACP (Agent Context Protocol), and identifies six fundamental categories of protocol transformations (e.g., A2T, E2A, etc.) to enable dynamic resource orchestration and cross-entity adaptation. This conceptual framework is internally consistent and demonstrably contributes to measurable performance gains in the evaluated benchmarks.
- The work exhibits good engineering rigor. The hierarchical design of AGENT ORCHESTRA effectively covers realistic usage scenarios, and the implementation details (such as task decomposition via a planning agent, structured step tracking with todo.md, and sandboxed execution) reflect good practical consideration.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty is limited. The key components of AGENT ORCHESTRA, including its hierarchical architecture, the role of the planning agent, and the instantiation of specialized sub-agents, largely follow established patterns in existing multi-agent systems. This work appears more as a well-engineered integration than a conceptual leap.
- The experiments are not convincing. (a) The baselines used in the GAIA benchmark are not justified, and some cited baselines lack proper references. (b) It is unclear why Table 1 only reports a subset of the results presented in Figure 4, while omitting others (e.g., Manus). (c) The performance of Claude-3.7-Sonnet (without tools) on SimpleQA is missing.
- The computational overhead is unclear. The paper does not discuss the resource costs (e.g., latency, token consumption, memory footprint) introduced by the special design.
- There are some minor issues regarding the paper writing. (a) Figures 1 and 2 are small and similar in content. (b) Definition 1 of the TEA Protocol introduces several undefined symbols, hindering a clear understanding at a critical point in the paper. (c) Table 1 and Figure 4 seem redundant.

### Summary
This paper proposes the TEA Protocol, a unified interface for orchestrating environments, tools, and agents in LLM-based multi-agent systems. TEA defines three context protocols and six cross-protocol transformations to abstract away environment heterogeneity and enable dynamic resource interoperability. Building upon this protocol, the authors implement AGENTORCHESTRA, a hierarchical multi-agent system with a planning agent and specialized sub-agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate strong performance.

### Strengths
1. The paper identifies limitations in existing agent coordination protocols and provides a structured formalization of tool, environment, and agent contexts.
2. AGENTORCHESTRA integrates planning, browsing, research, analysis, and tool creation in a modular fashion, demonstrating thoughtful system design.

### Weaknesses
I am not an expert in agent orchestration, so please correct my mistakes in my questions

1. While the TEA protocol is conceptually neat, some parts read as an organization and consolidation of existing agent design patterns rather than truly introducing fundamentally new orchestration mechanisms. Analyze what is fundamentally new vs. structured re-framing would clarify the contribution.

2. The system appears computationally heavy, involving multiple agents and models per task. The paper does not provide efficiency analyses, e.g., latency and token usage, etc.

3. While the paper emphasizes dynamic transformations between tools, environments and agents, experiments focus on performance benchmarks rather than measuring adaptability metrics.

### Summary
The paper proposes: (1) the Tool–Environment–Agent (TEA) Protocol, which is an agentic protocol to unify tools, environments, and agents, and (2) AgentOrchestra, which is a hierarchical multi-agent system (planner + researcher + browser-use + analyzer + tool-manager). 

The authors begin by introducing the limitations of existing agentic protocols like MCP and A2A. The proposal, the TEA protocol, features a few core protocols (e.g. Tool Context Protocol, etc.) and six protocol transformations that enable dynamic resource orchestration. To validate the effectiveness of TEA, the authors present AgentOrchestra for general-purpose problem solving, featuring multiple agents collaborating with one another; each agent has a particular responsibility, e.g. planning. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks, like GAIA and HLE, show that AgentOrchestra achieves state-of-the-art of near state-of-the-art performance as compared to major baselines.

### Strengths
1. Timely research topic and area. Agentic protocol is a very hot topic right now in the LLM research community since these protocols connect different agentic components, e.g. tools, context/memory, etc. There have been many research around MCP, e.g. on security, efficiency, design, etc. This paper adds on to this line of research by pointing out the limitations of existing protocols and introducing the design of a new one. Discussion on different protocol components (tool, environment, agent) is clear and helpful to understanding the problem space. 

2. Evaluation results of AgentOrchestra are good. Both GAIA and HLE and challenging and widely used benchmarks in the agent research space, and as someone who works on this topic I can confirm that the evaluation numbers are quite impressive; ~25% on HLE is almost on par with GPT-5, much better than the performance of individual components' LLMs.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors claim that existing agentic protocols like A2A and MCP have "fundamental" limitations. In particular, the introduction section lists three of these limitations. However, these claimed limitations are not discussed with enough depth (they are never mentioned again after the first half of the introduction section), and it is unclear in what scenarios, how, and why would A2A or MCP fail in existing agent applications. Appendix B does provide some motivation for TEA, but never directly targets why A2A and MCP could fail. Without a clear motivation and a thorough analysis of existing agentic protocols, it is quite confusing for a reader to directly go into the design of the TEA protocol itself. 

2. It is unclear why the design and evaluation of AgentOrchestra is able to validate the effectiveness of TEA. Admittedly, the evaluation results are quite impressive with AgentOrchestra on GAIA, HLE, etc. It is very likely that the good results source from deliberate separation of responsibilities across different LLMs, as seen in many recent multi-agent papers, instead of from the TEA protocol itself. To demonstrate the superiority of the TEA protocol, a fair comparison would be to show that AgentOrchestra based on TEA outperforms AgentOrchestra based on A2A or MCP. The existing baselines used in the evaluation feature agents and LLMs with varying agentic capabilities, and I am unable to conclude whether the good numbers we see are a result of TEA, of the multi-agent design, or of the LLMs selected.

### Summary
This paper introduces the Tool-Environment-Agent (TEA) Protocol, a conceptual framework designed to unify the interaction between agents, tools, and environments by treating all three as first-class, inter-convertible resources. Based on this protocol, the authors implement AgentOrchestra, a hierarchical multi-agent system. AgentOrchestra features a central planning agent that decomposes tasks and delegates them to specialized sub-agents, including a deep researcher, a browser user, a data analyzer, and a novel tool manager for dynamic tool creation. The system is evaluated on the GAIA, SimpleQA, and HLE benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, notably scoring 83.39% on the GAIA test set.

### Strengths
1.  **Novel Conceptual Framework:** The proposed TEA protocol is a valuable conceptual contribution. By treating environments and agents as first-class resources on par with tools, and defining transformations between them (e.g., A2T, E2T), the paper offers a more principled and extensible way to think about agent architecture compared to existing protocols like MCP or A2A.

2.  **Comprehensive System Implementation:** AgentOrchestra is a well-engineered and complex system. The hierarchical structure with a clear division of labor among specialized agents (planner, researcher, browser, analyzer, tool manager) demonstrates a sophisticated approach to solving complex, multi-step tasks. The inclusion of a tool manager agent that can dynamically create and reuse tools is particularly noteworthy.

3.  **Strong Empirical Performance on Q&A/Reasoning Benchmarks:** The reported results are impressive, particularly the state-of-the-art performance on the GAIA benchmark. This demonstrates that the proposed architecture is highly effective for the types of complex reasoning and web-based information retrieval tasks prevalent in these benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Lack of Scientific Rigor and Justification:** The paper reads more like a technical report describing a system than a scientific paper. It excels at describing *what* was built but falls short on explaining *why* specific design choices were made. The ablation study (Table 3) is simplistic, merely showing that adding more components improves performance, which is an intuitive but not insightful finding. It fails to justify the hierarchical structure over, for instance, a flat multi-agent system or a single monolithic agent equipped with all tools. The paper lacks the theoretical or empirical rigor to convince the reader that this specific architecture is optimal or even principled.

2.  **Narrow and Potentially Biased Evaluation Scope:** The paper claims AgentOrchestra is a "general-purpose" framework and highlights its advanced capabilities, such as a Browser Use Agent for fine-grained web interaction and a Python interpreter. However, the evaluation is confined to Q&A and reasoning-style benchmarks (GAIA, SimpleQA, HLE). The system's claimed capabilities are not tested on benchmarks designed to rigorously evaluate them, such as **SWE-bench** for software engineering tasks or **OSWorld/Mind2Web** for complex, interactive environment navigation. This mismatch between claimed generality and tested specificity undermines the paper's central claims.

3.  **Absence of Efficiency and Cost Analysis:** Multi-agent systems are notoriously expensive in terms of token consumption and latency due to the overhead of communication and orchestration. This is a critical factor for practical deployment. The paper completely omits any analysis of these costs. A comparison of token usage or wall-clock time against baselines would be essential to understand the trade-offs of this complex architecture. Without it, the impressive accuracy comes with an unknown and potentially prohibitive cost.

4.  **Limited Comparison to Alternative Paradigms:** The baselines are exclusively other agent-based systems. The paper fails to compare against or even discuss an increasingly viable alternative: fine-tuning a single, powerful foundation model to perform such complex "deep research" tasks end-to-end (e.g. Tongyi Deep Research). It is unclear whether the immense complexity of multi-agent orchestration provides a definitive advantage over a powerful, specialized monolithic model.

### Questions
1.  Could the authors provide data on the token consumption (prompt, completion, and total) and average wall-clock time per task for AgentOrchestra versus a key baseline (e.g., a single-agent setup) on the GAIA benchmark? This would clarify the efficiency trade-offs of the hierarchical design.

2.  The paper claims strong browser and code execution capabilities. Why were benchmarks like SWE-bench or OSWorld not included in the evaluation? How would you anticipate AgentOrchestra performing on such interactive tasks compared to specialized agents designed for them?

3.  The core of the system is its hierarchical structure. What is the justification for this design over a "flat" collaborative multi-agent system where agents communicate as peers? Have you run experiments comparing these different orchestration paradigms?

4.  What are the authors' thoughts on the "orchestration vs. fine-tuning" debate? Could a single, powerful model fine-tuned on GAIA-like tasks achieve similar performance with much lower inference complexity compared to AgentOrchestra?
