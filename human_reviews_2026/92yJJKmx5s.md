- Scores: 2, 4, 4, 6

## Abstract
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to modeling physical and engineering systems. Operator learning approximates their solution operators, enabling fast inference after training across diverse problem instances and strong generalization. While recent advances have proposed unsupervised methods that mitigate the cost of data generation, classical neural network–based approaches remain computationally expensive for high-dimensional operators and fine-resolution problems. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum--classical hybrid framework for unsupervised spectral operator learning. Our approach predicts spectral coefficients using quantum circuits, with gate parameters mapped from PDE instances (e.g., forcing functions or PDE parameters) via a classical neural network. To improve efficiency and feasibility, we introduce a training objective that requires fewer measurement repetitions than standard variational quantum linear solvers (VQLS). With this, we design shallower circuits by replacing controlled-unitary gates with direct Pauli measurements, which in turn allows grouping of commuting measurement operators for further reduction in runtime. The objective also resolves the sign ambiguity inherent in standard VQLS and guarantees recovery of the correct solution sign for PDEs. Overall, our framework reduces the computational cost and improves solution accuracy of VQLS, while also demonstrating the potential efficiency and scalability advantages of quantum operator learning over classical machine learning approaches. We validate our framework on one- and two-dimensional reaction--diffusion, Helmholtz, and convection--diffusion equations under diverse boundary conditions, achieving relative errors below $1\%$.

### Summary
The author provides a hybrid quantum-classical method to solve the PDE by incorporating the classical neural network parameterised quantum states, the VQLS solver, and the improved loss function. The result and the proposed advances are very clear, with sufficient experiments.

### Strengths
1. The improved loss function reduced the complexity of the VQLS algorithm.
2. The parameterised model "seems" to have better representation capacity than the original parameterised state in VQLS.

### Weaknesses
1. The demonstration of why the neural network parameterised state is better lacks persuasion.
2. The simplification of the loss function VQLS is quite trivial. (Please correct me if I am wrong)

### Questions
1. What is the cost of using only the real part of equation 5 as the target?
2. Why neural network parameterised state better than the usual VQLS method? Please clarify this from a theoretical aspect.

### Summary
The authors target the problem of unsupervised spectral operator learning addressing the high training costs of the classical methods for high dimensional operators or when using higher resolutions. They propose a quantum-classical hybrid framework for this.  They argue that since using the previous methods to predict the K coefficients results in squared dependence on the complexity and there instead using the classical neural network to predict the circuit parameters and then using the newly proposed quantum circuit to predict the coefficients from those angles can then lead to K log K dependence since final prediction of the coefficients is the bottleneck step in the inference using the standard classical neural networks. The authors then demonstrate their proposed scheme on 1 and 2 D PDEs where they achieve low error rates.

### Strengths
The overall idea seems intuitive since I agree that this can theoretically enhance the complexity by just augmenting the final coefficienct prediction step to instead using a quantum VQLS. The novel training loss for this classical quantum setup also seems fine and the optimized number of gates also further helps in reducing the complexity. The experimental results indicate the authors are able to train this system for the standard PDE tasks.

### Weaknesses
Like the proposal of just augmenting the final prediction via a quantum VQLS seems not a very solid technical contribution. Furthermore even though theoretical we can argue for the complexity but I am bit unsure whether this hybrid framework can actually lead to some advantages. Also the authors didn't compare the performance with the completely classical counterpart. The authors although discussed hardware efficient training in the appendix, I am unsure how much accuracy will be hurt as compared to completely classical network and in higher dimensions how much stable would be the training of this joint learning setup since now the classical network is just predicting some angle parameters as against the final input, it might harm the training of the classical part as well. Also, I didn;t find the discussion for the impact of noise in the quantum solver to the output and training.

### Questions
Since now the output of the classical part is changed, can this harm its training? Also, is some completely quantum algorithm possible for this? What would be the impact of the noise due to the quantum hardware on this learning which is a practical setup.

### Summary
This paper proposes NVQLS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for the unsupervised operator learning of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The method first discretizes the continuous PDE into a high-dimensional linear system $A\alpha = F$ via spectral methods. It then trains a classical neural network (an "Angle Network") to learn the map from the PDE instance $f$ (which defines $F$) to the parameters $\theta$ of a variational quantum circuit. This quantum circuit, a modified Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), then prepares the solution state $|\hat{\alpha}\rangle$. The authors claim two primary contributions: (1) A new "overlap" cost function (Eq. 7) that solves the standard VQLS's "sign ambiguity" problem and reduces its measurement complexity. (2) A full hybrid framework that, by using the classical network to learn a "compressed" $K \to \log K$ map, allegedly reduces the overall complexity from the classical $O(K^2)$ to $O(K \log K)$.

### Strengths
1. A Novel and Critical Improvement to VQLS: The paper's most significant contribution is the new "overlap cost function" (Eq. 7). This is a genuine and valuable innovation. It correctly identifies two crippling flaws in the standard VQLS (Eq. 5): its $O(L^2)$ complexity and its "sign ambiguity" (due to the fidelity loss $\propto |\cdot|^2$). The proposed loss function elegantly solves both problems simultaneously: it is linear (not quadratic), thus preserving the solution's sign, and its numerator reduces the complexity to a single summation $O(L)$. This makes VQLS a much more viable algorithm for physical problems like PDEs.
2. Intelligent Hybrid Framework Design: The proposed AI-quantum architecture is well-motivated. It correctly identifies the $O(K^2)$ bottleneck of purely classical spectral operator learning. The proposed "division of labor"—using a classical NN for the "easy" $K \to n$ (where $n=\log K$) parameter mapping and a quantum circuit for the "hard" $n \to K$ state preparation—is a theoretically sound and intelligent approach to tackling this classical scaling challenge.

### Weaknesses
Despite the strength of its proposed loss function, the paper's central claim of a "quantum advantage" (i.e., the $O(K \log K)$ complexity) rests on a fatal theoretical assumption that is never justified. Furthermore, the experimental validation is methodologically flawed, failing to provide convincing evidence of the model's true accuracy.
1. The "Quantum Advantage" Claim is Based on an Unjustified Expressibility Assumption: The paper's entire $O(K \log K)$ complexity argument is built on a "missing" assumption: that a shallow quantum circuit with $O(\text{poly}(n)) = O(\text{poly}(\log K))$ parameters has sufficient expressibility to approximate the $K$-dimensional solution $\alpha$ to a high degree of accuracy.
2. The Core Complexity Claim is Theoretically Unsound: This assumption is well-known to be false. The quantum variational algorithm literature has established that for an ansatz to be "universal" (i.e., able to approximate any state in the $K$-dimensional space), its depth must scale exponentially with $n$, i.e., $O(\text{poly}(K))$. A shallow $O(\text{poly}(\log K))$ ansatz can only represent a vanishingly small fraction of the solution space. The paper completely ignores this fundamental trade-off between ansatz depth (cost) and approximation error (accuracy), which invalidates its central complexity claim.
3. Critical Hyperparameters are Omitted: Compounding the theoretical flaw above, the paper is critically vague about its experimental setup. It provides extensive detail on the classical network's architecture (Table 3), but I could not find any mention of the quantum circuit's depth ($l_V$). This is the single most important hyperparameter for determining the model's expressibility and cost, and its omission is a serious flaw in reproducibility and transparency.
4. Inappropriate Plotting for True Solution: While interpolation plotting for the predicted solution is acceptable due to the resolution limitations of the model, it is problematic that the true solution also seems to use interpolated plots. This raises concerns regarding the validity of the error calculations, as it is unclear whether the true solution was computed at the same resolution as the predicted solution or at a higher resolution. The authors should clarify this issue and ensure that the true solution used in error computations is based on a numerically reliable resolution.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel resource-efficient quantum-classical approach called the neural variational quantum linear solver (NVQLS) that combines neural operator learning with the efficiency of quantum linear solvers. The proposed approach shows a speed and performance advantage over existing methods.

### Strengths
The proposed approach could benefit researchers within the scientific machine learning community (both on the classical and quantum side), particularly if interested in exploring higher resource efficiency and possible performance gains for real-life problems.

The authors have evaluated their proposed method aganist ULGNet and the exact solutions for several well-known benchmark PDEs.

### Weaknesses
Given that the method builds upon VQLS, a known issue faced by variational algorithms is barren plateaus that may stall opimisation. Have the authors looked at how sensitive their method is to barren plateaus, particularly with deeper quantum architectures?

Furthermore, the Pauli decomposition results in a large number of terms that increase the size of the training circuit, which can cause measurement overhead.

### Questions
What design and hyper-parameter optimisation approaches were used to build the classical neural network part of the model?

Why was L-BFGS chosen as the default optimiser given that gradient-based methods are more performant for neural network training?

Many of the plots present the change in the cost of training and testing with epochs may show that training could've been conducted with fewer steps.
