# Beyond RNA Structure Alone: Complex-Aware Fusion for Tertiary Structure-based RNA Design

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 4, 4, 8

## Abstract
Tertiary structure-based RNA design plays a crucial role in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While existing methods have explored structure-to-sequence mappings, they focus solely on RNA structures and overlook the role of complex-level information, which is crucial for effective RNA design. To address this limitation, we propose the Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design model, CARD, that integrates complex-level information to enhance tertiary structure-based RNA sequence design. To be specific, our method incorporates protein features extracted by protein language model (e.g., ESM-2), enabling the design model to generate more accurate and complex relevant sequences. Considering the biological complexity of protein-RNA interactions, we introduce a distance-aware filtering for local features from protein representation. Furthermore, we design a high-affinity design framework that combines our CARD with an affinity evaluation model. In this framework, candidate RNA sequences are generated and rigorously screened based on affinity and structural alignment to produce high-affinity RNA sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with an improvement of 7.3% compared with base model without our complex-aware feature integration. A concrete case study for 2LBS further validates the superiority of our CARD.

### Summary
This paper introduces CARD (Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design), a deep learning model for the RNA inverse folding problem. The authors rightly argue that existing methods, which focus solely on RNA structure, are insufficient because RNA folding and function are often dependent on interactions within a larger biomolecular complex (e.g., with proteins). The authors evaluate CARD on a filtered version of the PRI30K dataset and the PRA201 blind test set, showing good performance in sequence recovery rate compared to baselines like RhoDesign and RDesign.

### Strengths
1. Valid Problem Formulation: The paper's core premise is strong and addresses a well-known limitation in computational biology. Modeling RNA design in the context of its binding partners is a logical and necessary next step for the field, moving beyond the isolated "RNA-only" inverse folding problem.
2. Practical Framework: The proposed high-affinity design framework, which combines the generative model (CARD) with evaluative models (affinity predictor, structure folder), represents a practical, fully in silico workflow for optimizing functional RNA sequences.

### Weaknesses
1. Omission of Protein Structural Information: The model uses the 3D structure of the RNA (via GVP) and 3D distance information for its filtering mechanism, but it puzzlingly discards the 3D structure of the protein. Instead, it relies only on 1D sequence embeddings from a PLM (ESM-2). Given that protein-RNA interaction is fundamentally a 3D structural problem, this seems like a significant missed opportunity to provide the model with richer, more relevant features. The authors acknowledge this as a limitation but do not justify the initial design choice.
2. Focus on Sequence-Based Metrics: The evaluation relies heavily on sequence recovery rate and Macro F1-score. While the case studies show RMSD for specific examples, the paper would be more convincing if it included a comprehensive structural evaluation (e.g., average RMSD of folded designed sequences) across the entire test set. This would provide a clearer picture of whether the model's complex-aware approach also yields better structural preservation.
3. Purely In Silico Case Study: The high-affinity design case studies for 2LBS and 2HGH are entirely computational. The framework generates sequences with CARD and then "validates" them using AlphaFold3 for structure and a custom-trained ensemble model for affinity. This iterative loop optimizes for the predictors' biases, not for true in vitro binding affinity or structural stability. Without any experimental validation, this section only proves that the model can generate sequences that other computational models score highly, which is a form of circular logic.
4. Weak Justification for Core Novelty (Filtering): The main architectural novelty is the Distance-Aware Filtering module, specifically the "stratification-based distance-aware" approach ("H.Dist."). However, the ablation study in Table 3 does not provide a clear-cut case for its superiority.
  1. The simpler "G.Dist." (greedy distance filtering) achieves an overall recovery rate of 63.98%
  2. The proposed "H.Dist." achieves an overall recovery rate of 63.42%.
  3. The proposed method is outperformed by a simpler baseline in the main 'All' metric. The authors' explanation—that "H.Dist." is "more beneficial for longer RNA sequences"—feels like a post-hoc justification, especially when it underperforms on both "short" and "overall" recovery.
5. Poor Figure Quality: The figures throughout the paper (e.g., Figures 1, 2, 5, etc.) are simplistic and lack professional polish. They are not aesthetically pleasing. This detracts from the overall presentation quality of the manuscript and makes it harder to interpret the proposed architecture and results.

### Questions
1. Given that the simpler "G.Dist." filtering baseline outperforms your proposed "H.Dist." filtering in overall recovery rate (Table 3), can you provide a more robust justification for using the more complex, stratification-based method?
2. What was the rationale for discarding explicit protein 3D structural features and relying only on PLM sequence embeddings, especially when the RNA is represented structurally and your filtering mechanism is based on 3D distances?
3. In your high-affinity case study (Sec 3.3, Appendix D), you use an affinity predictor trained on the PRA201 dataset. Your case studies (2LBS, 2HGH) are also from PRA201. Was the affinity predictor trained on the entire PRA201 dataset, including 2LBS and 2HGH? If so, this seems to be a data leakage issue, where you are optimizing sequences for a predictor that has already been trained on the ground-truth affinity of the target complex.

### Summary
I have reviewed this paper before. The paper tackles tertiary-structure-conditioned RNA inverse folding and argues that protein context matters. It encodes protein residues with a protein PLM (e.g., ESM-2), filters them by distance-aware selection, and (in the new version) aggregates them via concentric shells in addition to the usual top-K and a global token. These protein features are fused with RNA representations in a Complex-Aware Transformer (CAFormer). Beyond sequence recovery/F1 on PRI30K and PRA201, the paper adds an iterative high-affinity design loop using an affinity predictor and validates candidates by predicted complex structures(AF3 / RFNA) with RMSD checks. Overall, compared to the prior version, the method is more biologically motivated (multi-scale shells) and the narrative is cleaner. The results suggest consistent gains over structure-only baselines, and the design loop is closer to a practical pipeline.

### Strengths
1. The multi-scale, concentric-shell pooling (near/mid/far + global) rectifies the “narrow top-K only” view. It’s simple, implementable, and aligns with intuition about local vs. non-local protein influences.
2. Incorporating structure prediction (AF3 / RFNA) and an RMSD check into the screening loop moves beyond single-metric score chasing and acknowledges structural feasibility.
3. The paper presents a coherent CAFormer story and documents core training settings and data curation better than the earlier version.
4. The shells vs. alternatives and the small vs. large ESM-2 variants give readers knobs they can tune; even the observation that scale gains are modest is operationally useful.

### Weaknesses
- The paper demonstrates AF3/RFNA + RMSD usage in the loop and with case studies, but there is no large-scale, test-set-level structural analysis (e.g., RMSD/TM-score distribution across many examples, with mean/median/IQR and confidence intervals). This prevents a clean answer to: Does protein context improve the structural realizability of designed sequences at scale, not just in a handful of candidates?  Maybe, for a representative test split (or a sizable subset), report distributions of RMSD and/or TM-score for (i) RNA-only variant vs. (ii) protein-aware model, under the same AF3/RFNA inference settings. Include success-rate curves under varying RMSD/TM thresholds, and provide per-length (short/medium/long) breakdowns. 


- The shells are distance-based pooling. There is still no explicit orientation / local frame/torsion angle encoding from the protein backbone, and no direct use of atomic coordinates beyond distances. If possible, consider adding a small ablation that augments the shell features with a lightweight geometric descriptor (e.g., local backbone frames, principal-axis orientation, dihedrals) at the selected residues. Show a couple of percent improvements or, if it doesn’t help, document the negative result transparently. I do think sole relying on PLMs is not a convincing way to support the authors' arguments.



- Minor: 
The pipeline still depends on a learned affinity predictor trained on relatively small data. Maybe the author could elaborate more on that.

### Summary
This paper introduces  a novel Complex-Aware RNA Design framework that addresses a critical limitation in existing methods by explicitly incorporating the protein-RNA interaction context into the inverse folding process. The core technical contributions include the Complex-Aware Transformer (CAFormer) and a biophysics-based distance-aware filtering mechanism. The paper further proposes a robust, scalable high-affinity design pipeline integrating sequence generation, affinity prediction, and structural validation, offering a computational alternative to resource-intensive experimental screening. Benchmarking against current baselines on challenging datasets (PRI30K, PRA201) demonstrates its superior performance and effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The paper is the first to systematically and successfully use the complete "protein-RNA complex" as the core design context, rather than the isolated RNA structure. This shift aligns far better with biological reality.

2. The integrated high-affinity design framework seamlessly connects sequence generation, affinity evaluation, and structural validation. This comprehensive approach provides a powerful and computationally scalable solution for identifying functional sequences.

3. The method demonstrates performance improvements on both the standard benchmark (PRI30K) and, critically, on the more challenging blind test set (PRA201), proving the method's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The distance-aware filtering mechanism, while conceptually well-grounded in biophysics, empirically yields a slightly lower overall recovery rate than the simpler greedy distance selection (as shown in Table 3). The authors could address this trade-off by providing a deeper mechanistic explanation for this counter-intuitive result and clearly justifying the necessity of the complex biophysics-based approach when a simpler strategy performs better empirically.

2. The affinity predictor, a cornerstone of the high-affinity screening pipeline, is currently only validated through internal cross-validation. A comprehensive external benchmark against contemporary state-of-the-art affinity prediction models is crucial to objectively establish its competitiveness

3. The significant performance drop observed in Fold 3 compared to other cross-validation folds strongly suggests model sensitivity to data partitioning or distribution differences. This instability is concerning as it could introduce large, undesirable variance when the framework is applied in high-throughput, real-world screening contexts.

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate on how the ensemble scheme specifically leverages the "respective advantages" of the three lightweight models to ensure high screening accuracy? Furthermore, what is the rationale for not integrating a single, proven, high-accuracy predictor (such as Boltz2) directly into the pipeline, and have you benchmarked the resulting screening performance difference?

2. Given that interface geometric complementarity is crucial for protein-RNA recognition, the current use of ESM-2 only encodes protein sequence information. Have the authors considered integrating models (such as SAProt) that explicitly utilize both protein sequence and structural information to potentially enrich the binding mode representation and further enhance the design fidelity?

All other questions reiterate the items listed under Weaknesses. I am very willing to increase my overall score if the authors successfully address these concerns.

### Summary
This paper presents CARD (Complex-Aware tertiary structure-based RNA Design), a framework for RNA inverse folding that explicitly incorporates protein–RNA complex information rather than relying solely on RNA structures. The authors introduce a Complex-Aware Transformer (CAFormer) that fuses RNA structural features with protein representations from pretrained protein language models (e.g., ESM-2), enhanced by a distance-aware filtering mechanism to focus on interaction regions. Furthermore, they design a high-affinity RNA design framework combining CARD with an affinity evaluation model for iterative screening. Experiments on the PRI30K and PRA201 datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous structure-only baselines (e.g., RhoDesign, RDesign), with clear gains in recovery rate and F1 score. Overall, the work contributes an effective and biologically meaningful approach to complex-aware RNA design and shows strong empirical results supported by detailed ablation and case studies.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem—RNA design within protein–RNA complexes—with a clearly novel formulation. The proposed CARD framework is original in integrating tertiary RNA structures with protein context via a Complex-Aware Transformer and distance-aware filtering, yielding clear methodological innovation. The work is technically sound, well-executed, and supported by strong empirical evidence across multiple datasets. The presentation is clear and well-organized, and the results demonstrate meaningful biological significance and consistent improvements over prior RNA design methods.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is well executed, a few areas could be strengthened. First, the method relies mainly on protein sequence embeddings without explicitly modeling protein 3D structures, which may limit its ability to fully capture geometric interaction patterns.
