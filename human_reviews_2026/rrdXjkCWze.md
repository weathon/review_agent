## Abstract
We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.

### Summary
The paper studies a repeated price competition game with N sellers over T periods. In each period, sellers post prices simultaneously and publicly observe the joint price vector, but each seller only observes its own random demand. Seller i’s mean demand is modeled as a monotone single-index function $,\lambda_i(p)=\psi_i(\langle \theta_i, p\rangle),$ with $\theta_i=(-\beta_i,\gamma_i)$, $\beta_i>0$, and $\psi_i$ unknown, increasing, and $s_i$-concave. The domain of the index is $U=[-p_{\max},p_{\max}]$, and noises are sub-Gaussian. Each seller’s goal is to maximize revenue and minimize a regret metric defined against a dynamic benchmark best-response $\Gamma_i(p_{-i})=\arg\max_{p_i\in P_i} p_i \psi_i(-\beta_i p_i+\langle \gamma_i, p_{-i}\rangle)$ while treating rival prices as fixed. The policy uses a common exploration of length $\tau\propto T^\xi$ to estimate $(\theta_i,\psi_i)$ in two stages via centered least squares (for $\theta_i$ under elliptical designs) and shape-constrained nonparametric least squares (for $\psi_i$ with monotonicity and $s$-concavity), then an exploitation phase applying iterative best responses with the learned models. A key structural identity links virtual valuation curvature $\phi_i'(u)\ge c_i$ to $s$-concavity with $s_i=c_i-1$, enabling a tuning-free estimator and equilibrium analysis through a contraction of the best-response map.

In this paper, the authors prove (1) The existence of a unique Nash Equilibrium, characterized by $p_i^\star=\Pi_{P_i}, g_i(\langle \gamma_i,p_{-i}^\star\rangle)/\beta_i$ where $g_i(u)=u-\phi_i^{-1}(u)$, and the joint best-response operator $\Gamma$ is a contraction when $\sup_i |g_i'|_\infty |\gamma_i|_1/\beta_i<1$. (2) The concentration for parameters: $|\hat\theta_i-\theta_i|_2=O\big(\sqrt{(N\log n^{(1)}i)/n^{(1)}i}\big)$; sup-norm nonparametric error $\mathbb{E}\big[\sup{u\in K}|\hat\psi{i,\hat\theta_i}(u)-\psi_i(u)|\big]=O\big((\log n^{(2)}_i/n^{(2)}_i)^{2/5}\big)$. And (3) the regret rate $O\big(T^\xi+T^{1-2\xi/5} N^{3/2} (\log T)^{2/5}\big)$ and $\mathbb{E}|p^{(T)}-p^\star|_2^2=O\big(N^{3/2} T^{-2\xi/5}(\log T)^{2/5}\big)$, optimized at $\xi=5/7$ to yield $\tilde O(N^{3/2}T^{5/7})$ regret and $\tilde O(N^{3/4}T^{-1/7})$ equilibrium convergence.

The authors also conduct numerical experiments with $N=2,4,6$ and log-concave links show convergence to NE and sublinear regret aligned with the theoretical rates, and finally a robustness check. Compared to existing literature, this work generalizes linear-demand competition with $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret to semiparametric monotone SIM under shape constraints and matches the known $\tilde O(T^{5/7})$ rate in the monopolistic SIM case while introducing a tuning-free $s$-concave NPLS analysis and a new equivalence between $\phi_i'$ and $s$-concavity.

### Strengths
(1) Technical connection between $\phi_i'(u)\ge c_i$ and $s$-concavity ($s_i=c_i-1$), enabling both equilibrium characterization and estimation under shape constraints.

(2) Sup-norm concentration for $h\circ$concave regression with $O((\log n/n)^{2/5})$ rates; careful two-stage estimation to decouple dependencies.

(3) Broadens beyond linear or fixed parametric nonlinear demand; theory covers NE existence/uniqueness and convergence under strategic coupling.

(4) Clean regret/convergence bounds tied to estimation rates; simulations align with theory.

Overall, this is a good work.

### Weaknesses
There are some issues that I’m most concerned about:

(1) The assumed knowledge on $c_i$ or $s_i$, which is a very strong assumption.

(2) The optimality of $\tilde O(N^{3/2}T^{5/7})$ regret. A matching lower bound is not established.

(3) The condition of contraction $\sup_i |g_i'|_\infty |\gamma_i|_1/\beta_i<1$ is not well justified in real-world markets.

### Questions
(1) How should practitioners set $c_i$ (and $s_i=c_i-1$) if unknown? Is there a safe adaptive surrogate (under/overestimation) that preserves contraction and regret rates?

(2) Do you conjecture a minimax lower bound matching $T^{5/7}$ for monotone $s$-concave SIM in this feedback model? Where is the main slack otherwise?

(3) Please elaborate on the exploration distribution assumption (elliptical with $g(x+y)=g(x)g(y)$). Also, if exploration uses truncated Gaussians within $P$ (non-elliptical full support), how do concentration results and the decoupling arguments change?

### Summary
The paper studies price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. Each seller’s demand depends on both their own and rivals’ prices. Sellers observe competitors’ prices but not competitors’ realized demand. The paper proposes a dynamic pricing policy that converges to the Nash equilibrium prices.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a novel semiparametric pricing policy for nonlinear mean demand. It adopts a more general framework of $s$-concavity.
The paper also establishes an upper bound on the total expected regret and analyze the convergence to the NE.

### Weaknesses
Major comments:

1. In Assumption 3.1, the constants $\underline{B}_{\psi_i}$  and 

$\overline{B}_{\psi_i}$ are assumed known. How do sellers obtain these values in real-world application? You can also provide some references to justify this assumption. 

2. In the exploration phase, price is randomly chosen. Can you provide some practical examples or some references to justify it?  

3. In the experiments, when estimating $\phi$, how is $\mathcal{H}_i$ in Equation (11) set?

Minor Comments:
1. Line 59: There is an extra comma after “own price.”
2. Line 75: “Early work Kirman (1975)” should be “Early work (Kirman, 1975).”
3. Line 88: “economics literature Birge et al. (2024); Li et al. (2024)” should be “economics literature (Birge et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024).”
4. Line 96: It seems missing some words between “symmetric p(t)” and “Brillinger (2012)”

### Summary
The paper considers a setting where sellers can observe each other’s prices but can only see their own demand. All sellers use the same learning algorithm, and the authors prove that each seller can achieve sublinear regret while the prices collectively converge to a Nash equilibrium. The theoretical results are both novel and solid, though they rely on several somewhat contrived assumptions. The paper uses simulations to validate the findings; it would be even better if the authors compared their approach with other algorithms.

### Strengths
The conclusions of this paper are novel and valuable. The study of demand learning under s-concavity extends the frontier of existing research on this topic. Moreover, the proofs are rigorous and nontrivial, making it an excellent theoretical contribution.

### Weaknesses
1.	In lines 54–56, it would be helpful to briefly explain how this assumption fundamentally differs from the previous linear model and what additional technical challenges it introduces in the analysis.
2.	Why don’t we restrict $\gamma_i \ge 0$? An increase in others’ prices usually leads to higher demand.
3.	In line 252, why is $\Gamma$ assumed to be Lipschitz? Is this an explicit assumption, or can it be derived from earlier conditions? It would also be helpful to clarify under what circumstances this assumption holds in practice.
4.	Section 3 contains numerous assumptions but lacks illustrative examples. For instance, the authors should provide some common examples of functions that satisfy s-concavity. Listing assumptions without explanation raises concerns about their practical relevance. In reality, demand functions rarely satisfy such properties. It would be valuable to discuss how regret behaves when these assumptions are violated, for example, how regret depends on the parameter $s$.
5.	The term “optimal” in Remark 5.6 is not precise. The paper lacks a lower-bound analysis, which is essential for assessing the tightness of the derived regret order. As mentioned in the experimental section, the observed rate in simulations is faster than the theoretical one, which likely stems from a loose upper bound. In such a case, the parameter can only be considered optimal with respect to the construction of this upper bound, rather than being a generally optimal $\xi$.
6.	The experimental section lacks comparisons with other algorithms. Even if alternative methods, such as those assuming a linear model with possible misspecification, are included, such comparisons would highlight the value of the additional assumptions introduced in this paper.
7.	It would be helpful for the authors to explain why exploration and exploitation are treated separately, rather than adopting optimism-based algorithms (e.g., UCB-type approaches) that integrate the two.

### Summary
This paper studies price competition among multiple sellers with public price information and private demand information. Under monotonicity and s-concave shape constraints on the demand function modelled by the single index model, the authors show that, using their proposed algorithm, the prices converge to NE at $O(T^{-1/7})$ rate and each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$. 

The algorithm follows a simple two-step approach, where all the sellers explore for a short time period to gather data for estimation, and then exploit with the estimated prices. The authors also argue that the convergence to NE is closely related to sublinear regrets of individual sellers.

A key observation in the proof is that the monotonicity of the virtual valuation is equivalent to the s-concave property (Proposition 3.5). Furthermore, the s-concavity of mean demand also guarantees the strong concavity of the revenue function.

### Strengths
- The conceptual relation of virtual valuation and s-concavity is elegant and useful.
- The demand model is single-index, and its estimation leverages semi-parametric least square regression, which is of theoretical depth.
- The overall writing is good; the presentation of assumptions, results, and algorithms is clear.

### Weaknesses
- The motivation of the proposed setting is not particularly strong, as it assumes that all the sellers invoke the same pricing algorithm. This was justified using some factual evidence from the practice at some area in Colorado but broader applicability is not well addressed.
- As mentioned by the authors, the convergence to NE and sublinear regrets are closely related (Line 240-266). Combining with the previous point of all sellers using the same algorithm, it is hard to see how this result differs significantly from the setting without competition, e.g., the prior work by Fan et al. (2024).

### Questions
- The algorithm relies on the knowledge of $s_i$. I understand that this limitation is acknowledged in the future direction section. It would strengthen the result significantly if this assumption can be relaxed. Can the algorithm potentially be improved to allow an estimation of $s_i$, or maybe it can be adapted to select from a grid of $s_i$ values (e.g., Lepski method)? More exploration on the possibility/challenge of this issue would be really helpful.
- Similarly, $[\underline{B}_i, \bar{B}_i]$ is required to be known. Can the authors add some brief explanation/justification of this into the main text?
- The authors comment on the tightness of the result (Line 432 - 444) by comparing with related result. Can these argument regarding lower bound be more rigorously stated? Especially given the concavity of the revenue function, one would typically assume a faster rate like $O(T^{-1/2}$ in classical literature. What is the key insight that drives the current regret bound?
- Assumption 5.1 appears unnecessarily abstract. What scenarios does it cover beyond sub-Gaussian?
- A short discussion on how the presented work relates to algorithmic collusion and potential societal impact could be practically meaningful
