## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in node classification tasks, but their performance is often hindered by the scarcity of labeled nodes. Recently, graph domain adaptation has emerged as a promising solution to transfer knowledge from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. However, most existing methods typically rely on a closed-set assumption, which fails when unknown classes exist in the target domain. Toward this end, in this paper, we investigate the challenging open-set graph domain adaptation problem and propose a dual evidence-aware uncertainty learning framework ETA that simultaneously identifies unknown target nodes and enhances knowledge transfer under the evidential learning theory. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch encoder to capture both implicit local structures and explicit global semantic consistency within the graph, and leverage evidential deep learning to integrate the evidence from both branches, where the resulting evidence is parameterized by a Dirichlet distribution to estimate class probabilities and enable uncertainty quantification. Based on the identified unknown target node, we further construct cross-domain neighborhoods and perform MixUp-based virtual sample generation in the latent space. Then, we introduce evidential adjacency-consistent uncertainty to evaluate uncertainty consistency across neighborhoods, which serves as auxiliary guidance for robust domain alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ETA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in open-set graph domain adaptation tasks.

### Summary
The paper "ETA: Dual Evidence-Aware Uncertainty Learning for Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation" proposes a novel framework to address the challenging problem of Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) where the target graph contains new, unknown classes not seen in the source domain.

### Strengths
1. The proposal of a dual-branch encoder is well-motivated. Graphs exhibit both local neighborhood effects and long-range dependencies, and capturing evidence from both perspectives before fusing it via the evidential learning framework likely leads to more robust and accurate evidence accumulation for final classification and uncertainty estimation.

2. The introduction of MixUp-based virtual sample generation in the latent space, conditioned on identified unknown nodes and cross-domain neighborhoods, is a clever technique. This MixUp strategy creates an auxiliary supervision signal that encourages smoother transitions between known classes and the unknown class, promoting more robust domain alignment while mitigating the negative transfer caused by the unknown samples.

### Weaknesses
1. The performance of EDL-based models can be sensitive to the design of the evidence loss and regularization terms (e.g., the $\mathcal{L}_{\text{evidence}}$ term mentioned in similar literature). The description of the evidential adjacency-consistent uncertainty term suggests a careful loss formulation, but the precise formulation and parameter tuning should be detailed and discussed.

2. While fusing local and global evidence is intuitive, the paper may need clearly explain how the evidence from the two branches (Dirichlet distributions) is formally combined/integrated (e.g., using Dempster-Shafer theory's combination rule or a simpler summation/concatenation of concentration parameters) and why that specific fusion method is optimal for this graph problem.

### Questions
1. May provide detailed visualizations (e.g., t-SNE) comparing the latent space representations of ETA versus leading baselines (like SDA and UAGA), explicitly showing the separation of source, target-known, and target-unknown features before and after alignment.

2. Ablation studies may include a variant of ETA that uses a standard confidence-based threshold (like maximum softmax probability or entropy) instead of the full EDL uncertainty for unknown detection, to quantify the specific benefit of EDL.

### Summary
This paper investigates the challenging open-set graph domain adaptation problem, it proposes a dual evidence-aware uncertainty learning framework ETA that simultaneously identifies unknown target nodes and enhances knowledge transfer under the evidential learning theory. The proposed ETA integrates edge-oriented and path-oriented branches, generalizes evidential learning for unknown quantification, and performs cross-domain MixUp to generate virtual samples as auxiliary supervision signals for robust domain alignment.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a dual evidence-aware uncertainty learning framework ETA to investigate the challenging open-set graph domain adaptation problem. 
2. Extensive experiments on citation networks demonstrate that ETA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in open-set graph domain adaptation tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of the article is unclear. As described in the introduction that there exists several works in the field of open-set graph domain adaptation [1,2], what is the significance of the author's proposed ETA?
2. The proposed ETA generalizes evidential learning for unknown quantification, focusing on evidential learning after classification, that is, ETA mainly addresses open-set problem, regardless of whether it is a graph-structured domain adaptation.
3. Single dataset, only focusing on citation network, and lacking blog network or airline network to verifing effectiveness of ETA.

### Summary
This paper proposes a dual evidence-aware uncertainty learning framework named ETA to addresses the open-set graph domain adaptation problem. ETA uses a dual-branch encoder to extract node features, leverages evidential learning to quantify uncertainty and identify unknown nodes, and performs cross-domain Mixup with evidential adjacency-consistent uncertainty for robust domain alignment. Experiments on three citation network datasets show ETA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in classifying known target nodes and detecting unknown ones.

### Strengths
**Originality:** This work pioneers the use of evidential deep learning and Dempster's rule in open-set GDA, tackling the underexplored tasks of uncertainty quantification and unknown class detection.

**Quality:** The proposed framework is technically sound and well-developed. The authors provide theoretical support for the core mechanism of uncertainty detection, providing a solid foundation for the efficacy of the model. The experimental section is comprehensive, the t-SNE visualizations and uncertainty analysis are particularly compelling.

**Clarity:** The paper is well organized and easy to understand. The model architecture diagram intuitively illustrates the composition and data flow of ETA, so that the reader can quickly grasp the core idea of the model.

**Significance:** The studied problem breaks through the limitations of traditional GDA and makes it more suitable for practical applications where new categories or unknown entities often appear.

### Weaknesses
**About the case about the problem:** Although the studied problem is novel, there is a lack of practical cases to illustrate its practical significance.

**About the Hyperparameters:** The model introduces several key hyperparameters, notably the uncertainty threshold $\eta$. In a fully unsupervised target domain scenario, it is not clear how an optimal $\eta$ could be set a priori.

**About the Computational Complexity:** The cross-domain neighbor search and MixUp may introduce significant computational overhead.

### Questions
1. Could you give an example of open-set GDA in real life, so that people can understand its true meaning more clearly.
2. Could you elaborate on how to select an appropriate threshold $\eta$ when facing different target domains? 
3. What strategies does ETA employ to handle the additional computational overhead introduced during the domain alignment process?

### Summary
This work analyzes the challenges of Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation (OSGDA), where models must transfer knowledge learned on source graphs to target graphs containing unknown classes. The authors propose a novel framework named ETA, whose core lies in leveraging evidence-based deep learning to quantify prediction uncertainty, thereby enabling principled identification of unknown-class nodes. Additionally, the paper introduces a dual-branch encoder and a novel cross-domain MixUp strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing methods across three benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The core idea of this work—leveraging evidence learning to quantify uncertainty for identifying unknown classes—is innovative. It employs evidence-based deep learning to learn supporting evidence for each category and utilizes Dirichlet distributions to model class probabilities. The method is well-designed and supported by rigorous experiments.

### Weaknesses
This approach appears to be a clever integration of existing mature techniques (GNNs, EDL, MixUp) rather than a fundamental paradigm shift. 
The main text omits discussions on computational complexity and the selection strategy for the critical hyperparameter $\eta$, relegating these crucial experimental analyses to the appendix. 
Experiments are confined to homogenized citation network datasets, which are limited in variety, and the number of nodes in each dataset is not clearly specified.

### Questions
This approach ingeniously integrates three established techniques: GNN, EDL, and MixUp. Beyond the ultimate empirical performance gains, does this particular combination yield any new theoretical or mechanistic insights?
The design of Equation (14) appears heuristic. Beyond empirical success, is there a more comprehensive description demonstrating this as a sound form for achieving evidence consistency?
Experiments are entirely confined to citation networks. How do you assess the method's generalization potential on graphs with vastly different topologies?
What are your thoughts regarding future work?
