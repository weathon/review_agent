## Abstract
Distinguishing the rare "driver" mutations that fuel cancer progression from the vast background of "passenger" mutations in the non-coding genome is a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. A primary mechanism that non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer is by affecting gene expression, potentially from millions of nucleotides away. However, existing predictors of gene expression from mutations are unable to simultaneously handle interactions spanning millions of base pairs, the extreme sparsity of somatic mutations, and generalize to unseen genes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to learn mutation representations and their impact on gene expression. GVF efficiently predicts the effect of mutations up to 8 million base pairs away from a gene by only considering mutations and their local DNA context, while omitting the vast intermediate sequence. Using data from 864 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that GVF predicts gene expression with 26-fold higher correlation across samples than current models. In addition, GVF is the first model of its kind to generalize to unseen genes and samples simultaneously. Finally, we find that GVF patient embeddings are more informative than ground-truth gene expression for predicting overall patient survival in the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, luminal A. GVF embeddings and gene expression yielded concordance indices of $0.706^{\pm0.136}$ and $0.573^{\pm0.234}$, respectively. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for modeling the functional impact of non-coding mutations in cancer and provides a powerful new tool for identifying potential driver events and prognostic biomarkers.

### Summary
This paper introduces GenVarFormer (GVF), a transformer-based model that predicts tumor gene expression directly from sparse somatic mutations, targeting the long-range, non-coding “driver vs passenger” problem in cancer. GVF considers variants up to 16 Mbp from a gene, hence addressing the limitations of methods only considering proximal variants. Trained on 864 TCGA breast tumors with in silico–purified cancer expression targets, the model is evaluated under splits that test generalization to unseen samples, genes, and both simultaneously. GVF achieves a 26-fold higher average across-sample correlation per gene than hotspot-lasso baselines (0.219 vs 0.008) and also outperforms sequence-to-function models. Architecturally, GVF uses nested tensors, a bin-packing sampler that caps total variants per batch, and a Triton RoPE kernel for arbitrarily positioned tokens, enabling scalable training without padding blow-ups. GVF is reported to be three orders of magnitude faster than Flashzoi at matched context with lower peak memory, and performance roughly doubles when the window expands from ~0.5 Mbp to 16 Mbp. The authors also show that patient embeddings derived from GVF layers capture subtype structure and provide clinically useful signals beyond mutation hotspots.

### Strengths
- The authors aim to predict gene expression from sparse somatic mutations across megabase scales, squarely tackling long-range, non-coding drivers with a custom-built model rather than sequence-only surrogates.
- There are some nice tricks in this paper, such nested tensors, a bin-packing sampler, and a Triton RoPE kernel that enable long contexts without padding blow-ups; they also show major speed/memory wins versus Flashzoi at matched context.
- Training on TCGA BRCA samples and testing generalization across unseen samples, unseen genes, and both simultaneously makes the results more convincing than single-split reporting.
- They report significantly higher across-sample correlation per gene than hotspot-lasso, and beat sequence-to-function models.
- Patient embeddings appear to capture subtype structure and even outperform ground-truth expression for overall survival in luminal A, suggesting bona fide translational utility.

### Weaknesses
Please refer to questions.

### Questions
- I am not sure why the authors are only focusing on somatic mutations. Gene expression is a function of all variants, germline and somatic. In fact, germline mutations are one of the main reasons different people have significantly different prognosis and outcomes. I don’t believe germline mutations can be left for future work in this context.
- All training/eval is on 864 TCGA breast tumors; there’s no external cohort (e.g., CPTAC) or pan-cancer validation, so generalizability is unclear. 
- There are many existing tools (AlphaGenome, BigRNA, ChromBPNet, DeepSEA, Enformer, etc) that predict the consequences of genomic variants on chromatin accessibility, histone marks, TF/RBP binding, promoter activity, (alternative) splicing, gene expression, etc. Why are none of them used here? Sure, the cellular context in cancer cells will be different, but the model will be able to learn it.   
- Depending on cancer type, a significant number of genes (in particular tumor suppressors) are silenced through hyper-methylation of their promoters (CpG islands). How are absence of epigenomic factors handled in this analysis? On that note, how is the performance breakdown across oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and other gene groups?
- In most cancers, a small number of activated key oncogenes start de-regulating cellular processing with massive consequences, e.g., change in expression of other genes, not because they have somatic mutations, but due to other genes being activated or silenced. What will be GVF's performance in such cases?  
- The authors mention that one of the major benefits of their method over others is its generalizability to new genes, such as fusion products. How can this be validated in TCGA data?
- If Borzoi cannot be fine-tuned due to resource constraints, it should not be included. A Pearson correlation of 0.0043, which is most likely not statistically significant, is not very informative. 
- A correlation number by itself, especially when it is only 0.22, is not very meaningful. A couple of examples of how GVF can find hallmark genes with significant predicted and observed differential expression will be helpful.
- The authors predict “in silico purified” cancer expression (InstaPrism) and also regress out the top 10 PCs before z-scoring; both steps can remove real signal or introduce target noise/bias. There are genuine differences between subtypes, which seems to be wiped out (Figs. 4A and B).
- The survival analysis results use linear probes and are strongest only in luminal A (where are Luminal B and Her2?); robustness across subtypes and cohorts remains untested. I would also suggest reporting the Cox HRs.

### Summary
This paper introduces GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to predict gene expression from sparse, long-range somatic mutations in cancer. The key innovation is a model that processes only the mutated sites and their local DNA context within a very large window (up to 16 Mbp), omitting the vast intermediate sequence to achieve computational efficiency. The authors evaluate GVF on 864 breast cancer samples from TCGA, demonstrating a strong improvement in gene expression prediction over standard models. Furthermore, they claim that patient embeddings derived from GVF are more informative for predicting patient survival in the Luminal A breast cancer subtype than the ground-truth gene expression data the model was trained on.

### Strengths
- The core idea of modeling sparse, long-range genomic interactions by omitting the intermediate sequence is highly original and significant.

- The work demonstrates high technical quality. The authors implemented several non-trivial engineering solutions (nested tensors for efficiency, a custom RoPE kernel for arbitrarily positioned tokens, and a bin-packing sampler) that were critical for making their approach practical and efficient. 

- The paper is written with outstanding clarity. The motivation, methods, and results are presented logically and are easy to follow. The authors successfully bridge the gap between a complex biological problem and a sophisticated machine learning solution.

- The authors include a strong set of baselines, including standard bioinformatics methods (lasso on hotspots), state-of-the-art sequence models (Borzoi), and simple but effective heuristics (mean expression per subtype). The ablation on window size and the inclusion of an untrained model for the clinical tasks strengthen the paper's conclusions.

### Weaknesses
- The study relies on a single dataset of 864 samples. While TCGA is a high-quality resource, this sample size is small for deep learning and limits the statistical power of the findings, especially for the survival analysis. The lack of validation on an external cohort makes it difficult to assess the true generalizability of the model and its findings.

- The claim that GVF embeddings are superior to gene expression for survival prediction is a key result, but it should be tempered. This finding only holds for one of two tested cancer subtypes (Luminal A) and is not statistically robust, as indicated by the large and overlapping confidence intervals. This high variance is likely a direct consequence of the small dataset.

- While the 26-fold improvement over the lasso baseline is striking, this baseline's performance is near zero. A more sober and arguably fairer comparison is to the "mean subtype" baseline, where GVF still shows a strong ~3-fold improvement. Highlighting the 26-fold figure in the abstract feels like an overstatement of the practical performance gain.

### Questions
- The reliance on a single cohort is the primary limitation of this work. Can the authors comment on the availability of other public datasets with paired whole-genome and RNA sequencing data that could be used for external validation? 

- Given the large and overlapping confidence intervals for the survival prediction results in Luminal A, have the authors performed a formal statistical test to assess if this difference is significant? Could the authors tone down the claims in the abstract and conclusion to better reflect this uncertainty?

- The "Advantaged Features" (e.g., gene expression, copy number) provide a strong performance ceiling for the clinical prediction tasks. Have the authors considered a model that combines their mutation-derived GVF embeddings with these features? While the goal of the paper is to demonstrate the power of mutation data alone, showing that GVF provides complementary information could further strengthen the paper's contribution.

### Summary
GenVarFormer is a dl model that utilizes somatic mutation information surrounding a gene to predict the expression of interest. The model is a transformer with its input integrate various sources of information: mutations, flanking DNA sequences and gene embeddings. Authors train the model on 864 samples with paired WGS data (used to derive mutations) and RNA-seq (labels). They performed two type of experiments. Experiment 1 evaluates the regression performance of GVF versus Lasso hotspot models, Borzoi and a mean expression of subtypes. Experiment 2 use the model's embedding to cluster the samples into cell types.

### Strengths
The model implementation seems reasonable, which has adopted recent technologies such as Gradient Aligned Regression as loss and several technique to generate embeddings of mutations and variant allele fractions.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are relatively weak. The aim is to predict the gene expression using somatic mutations. The prediction of cell type mean is already 0.075, while GVF is 0.219, which is very low for Pearson correlation. Also, authors have regresses out the 10 principle components out in the training. This means that the model is actually trying to learn the residuals, while the most interesting variations may lie in the 10 regressed out PCs. I did not quite get the logic of experiment 2, the method should provide added value on top of cancer subtype classification. If one can easily infer the cancer subtypes from gene expression, what is the benefit of using a transformer to predict the same thing using the mutation information, which are much harder to derive and prone to errors. 

I think the authors might consider 
1. include two or three independent datasets as test data
2. try to include classic regression models such as simple linear regression model (y ~ cancer subtype + patient_id + \epsilon) and Gaussian process regression
3. not regressing out the first 10 PCs in experiment 1
4. use effect size or explained variance type of metric instead of Pearson correlation in experiment 1
5. show the biological relevance of the model prediction, e.g. ranking the input mutations and the top mutations are known driver mutations. the cancer subtype prediction is an easy task given mutations or gene expressions

### Questions
1. what is the effect size of residuals that GVF is trying to learn? I feel there might be not too much variance left after regressing out the first 10 PCs.
2. Can the Flanking DNA provide some information of driver mutations?

### Summary
The paper proposes a CNN-and-Transformer-based model for predicting gene expression from DNA, with the goal of untangling cancer-related alternations in expression stemming from DNA mutations.

### Strengths
The proposed tool is aimed at a difficult and important problem of predicting the effect of cancer driver mutations on gene expression and, downstream, on clinical variables such as survival, subtype, and stage. The paper goes beyond standard DNA-based Transformer but proposing a two-step pipeline involving mutations and gene sequence embedding, followed by a Transformer operating on the embeddings.

### Weaknesses
From a machine learning perspective alone, the proposed solution, involving embeddings and a Transformer, lacks substantial novelty. Unfortunately, the lack of details and broader context in describing the application (cancer mutations and their effect), as well as in placing the results in context of other bioinformatics approaches, do not show clear evidence that the proposed method substantially advances machine learning-based cancer bioinformatics. 

The manuscript is missing some crucial information that would put the work in context, especially for a broader machine learning audience. For example, while the introduction highlights the sparsity of mutations along the DNA, it does not provide information about the distribution of distances of regulatory sites that may be affected by these mutations from the TSS of genes they regulate. Without this information, it is unclear whether the selected window size of 16M is sufficient, or necessary.

Further, within the 16M window, the method operates by focusing on smaller window around mutation sites. The experimental section is vague in terms of how are mutations selected – are all mutations present in TCGA within the window used, or some approach is used to select driver mutations?

It is also unclear how much DNA (how many bps) the method actually utilizes in making the prediction. The sentence “GVF uses a DNA context window of 16Mbp” should be rephrased: for a general machine learning audience, this is understood as indicating that the Transformer model in GVF takes DNA sequences that are 16Mbp long on input (the phrase “context window” has a precise technical meaning in LLM-related domain), while in fact it seems to take embeddings of 32bp sequences from each of the n mutations present within 16Mbp (in that sense, it is more similar to a RAG system, using LLM terms). It is not clear from the experimental section what are the typical number of mutations (i.e., how many 32bp windows are being embedded and presented to the Transformer model). For comparison, Borzoi model takes on input a full 0.5Mbp sequence of DNA. 

The experimental results from evaluating the model are weak, and presented without much discussion. Predictive accuracy, as measured by Person’s rho, is very low (average of .21), but the utility of having a predictive model of expression changes with this level of accuracy is not discussed. In predicting expression changes from mutations, in a somewhat different experimental setup, Enformer and Borzoi achieve values mostly in the 0.4-0.6 range (see Liner et al, 2023, supplemental data/figures). Further, Fig 3B indicates that accuracy on “unseen genes and samples” is somewhat higher than for “unseen genes”, yet this surprising result is not discussed.

Results on predicting downstream clinical variables are also low (e.g. AUROC of 0.56 for early/late stage prediction), yet again are presented without discussion or context (e.g. what are the reference values for predicting overall/progression-free survival for these cancer types using existing established approaches).
