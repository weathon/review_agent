## Abstract
Chemical reaction diagrams are visual representations of complex process graphs, where understanding the overall pathway, including its branches, cycles, and flow, is crucial. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown proficiency in recognizing the individual nodes of these graphs, such as molecules and reagents, their ability to perform topological reasoning on the entire structure remains critically underexplored. This creates an urgent need for a targeted evaluation framework to probe this higher-order skill. Fulfilling this need, this paper introduces a systematic benchmark to evaluate this specific capability. We present **ReactBench**, a collection of 1,618 question-answer pairs designed to measure MLLM performance on a hierarchy of tasks, from component recognition to complex topological analysis. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a significant deficit: while GPT-4o achieves 79.71% accuracy on node-level identification tasks, its performance plummets to 49.5% on questions that require true topological reasoning about the pathway. By providing the first focused benchmark for this skill, our work establishes a rigorous methodology for diagnosing a key failure mode in MLLMs and guiding the development of models that can comprehend the full, structured processes depicted in scientific diagrams.

### Summary
This is a benchmark work evaluating the ability of MLLMs to perceive, understand, and reason over chemical reaction diagrams. 
The authors introduce ReactBench, a carefully annotated benchmark that encompasses four key aspects of diagram comprehension: element localization, information extraction, connectivity reasoning, and topology analysis.
Based on experiments, the authors reveal that the reasoning capability (rather than visual perception) is the principal bottleneck limiting current MLLMs’ performance on reaction diagram comprehension.

### Strengths
1. The authors clearly define their research scope within the domain of chemical reaction diagrams and provide a well-structured benchmark for systematic evaluation. 
2. The dataset is carefully annotated and covers multiple dimensions of diagram comprehension. 
3. The paper is well written, logically organized, and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
(see questions below)

### Questions
In Section 5, the authors design experiments to demonstrate the bottleneck that limits diagram comprehension. They introduce a JSON-formatted “External Knowledge (EK)” input that includes: (1) a list of bounding boxes indicating the locations of diagram elements, and (2) a list of triples describing reaction relationships. 

The authors describe EK as a form of ground-truth perception. However, I have some concerns here. Most current VLMs have not been trained for explicit visual grounding or object detection, which means they may not actually understand the location information encoded in bounding boxes. 

From this perspective, I’m not entirely convinced that EK enables “perfect perception” (as claimed around line 473). Instead, introducing clearer semantic cues (such as molecule names or subscript values) might serve as more meaningful external knowledge to support reasoning. 

I’d appreciate if the authors could further elaborate on this point. Thanks.

### Summary
The paper presents ReactBench, roughly 1.6k expert-annotated QA items from about 1.3k reaction diagrams, designed to probe four skills -- spatial localization, information extraction, pathway connectivity, and structural,topological analysis.  Modern MLLMs handle local recognition reasonably well but stumble on global,topological reasoning (e.g., strong on node ID, weak on path,graph structure). CoT and ``external knowledge'' inputs help but don’t close the gap, pointing to a reasoning rather than perception bottleneck.

The problem is well-motivated and the benchmark could become a useful community resource. Right now, the absence of strong structured baselines, metric robustness, leakage checks, and a clear release,licensing story keep it just below the bar.

### Strengths
S1 Clear, timely framing that isolates topological reasoning in chemical diagrams—an under-explored capability gap.  

S2 A hierarchical task design that feels diagnostic rather than one-shot leaderboard gaming.  

S3 Broad model coverage with qualitative failure analyses that are intuitive and instructive.  

S4 Sensible diagnostics (CoT, JSON parsing, “external knowledge” ablations) to separate perception from reasoning.

### Weaknesses
W1 Heavy reliance on exact-match scoring likely undercounts semantically correct answers; consider stronger normalization and semantic equivalence.  

W2 Some tasks blur topology with pure extraction; tighter isolation (e.g., graph-only synthetic schematics) would sharpen the causal claims.  

W3 Unclear dataset release,licensing plan given literature,patent sources; impact will be limited without a credible release.  

W4 No analysis of potential pretraining leakage or near-duplicate filtering, which weakens generalization claims.  

W5 Results lack uncertainty estimates (CIs), significance testing, or per-item difficulty analysis.  

W6 Missing strong graph-first baselines (e.g., OCSR → reaction-graph → algorithmic queries) to contextualize MLLM gaps.  

W7 Minor inconsistencies,clarity nits in tables,averages and terminology that make the results harder to parse.

### Questions
1. What is the concrete release plan (images, QA, prompts, scoring scripts) and how are IP,licensing risks handled?  

2. What are the annotation protocols and IAA statistics across task families?  

3. How did you check for train,test leakage against common pretraining corpora and patents?  

4. How robust is the metric under answer normalization or partial credit for correctly traced subpaths?  

5. Can you provide a topology-only synthetic subset to fully decouple OCR,chemistry text from structural reasoning?

### Minor comments
1. Fix minor typos (e.g., Temerature), normalize terms like “Multiple line(s),” and standardize fonts,spacing in figure tables.

### Summary
This paper proposes ReactBench, a benchmark for evaluating the topological reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on chemical reaction diagrams. It consists of 1,618 question-answer pairs across four aspects. The authors evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs to explore their ability to integrate visual and chemical knowledge.  While the benchmark itself is a valuable contribution, the paper needs a substantial revision before it can be accepted.

### Strengths
1. The released ReactBench benchmark might be extremely useful for future research on capabilities of Multimodal LLMs in understanding chemical reactions.

2. The experimental part of the paper covers a wide range of current Multimodal LLMs, serving as a useful benchmark for future research on chemical tasks.

3. Additional experimental analysis has revealed that even with explicitly provided structured data, MLLMs are not able to achieve accuracy above 65%.

### Weaknesses
1. Some of the key premises of the paper are not supported with any evidence. Specifically, no supporting references for the claims on weaknesses of OCSR methods are provided (Lines 87–92).

2. Vague description of the collected dataset hinders the reproducibility of the results as well as the generalization of the proposed data collection methodology. Specifically, no annotation guidelines as well as annotators' qualification are reported. The same omission applies to inter-annotator agreement.

3. The abstract defines the topological reasoning as the primary exploration target. However, the paper lacks a single-modal LLM baseline provided with a ground-truth textual representation of the graph (e.g., in SMILES or SELFIES). If a unimodal LLM (given ground-truth textual representation, e.g., SMILES) outperforms all MLLMs, it would suggest that the bottleneck lies not in chemical reasoning, but in either visual parsing or cross-modal alignment. At this point, the quantitative metrics are hard to interpret as it's not clear whether the provided metrics are high or low compared to uni-modal reasoning. 

4. The paper is hard to follow for a broad audience not familiar with chemistry. The examples in Figure 2 require more detailed explanations on why Product 2 does not count towards end products. Poor quality of illustrative figures (e.g., Figures 2, 4) in terms of readability makes the paper even harder to understand.

5. The usage of solely exact strict string matching may underestimate reasoning capabilities. A surface form variation (e.g., "2" vs "two") or a correct but slightly paraphrased entity name would be penalized as a complete failure, potentially underestimating a model's partial understanding. The inclusion of a soft metric (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) or LLM-as-a-judge for a subset of free-form answers would give a broader view of the results.

6. The paper does not provide the names of the chemical literature and patent database used for data collection (line 181-183) which strongly reduces the usability and reliability of the proposed dataset.

### Questions
* Line 087-092: The claimed weaknesses of OCSR methods are not supported with any references.

* Line 094: "existing benchmarks" - Please specify the benchmarks?

* Line 242-242: "The annotation process involves several iterative rounds of cross-checking" - Did you measure inter-annotator agreement?

* Line 183-187: - please specify what is implied under incomplete mechanisms, ambiguous visual representations. 

* To what extent does the strict exact-match evaluation protocol impact the absolute performance scores, particularly for the "Structural Topology Analysis" tasks where answers might be more conceptual (e.g., "linear chain with a branch")? Did you experiment with a less strict evaluation protocol?

* In Table 2, the "Average" is an arithmetic mean over four tasks with vastly different numbers of questions (e.g., Element Localization has 835, Reasoning has 167 samples). The weighted average would provide a more representative summary statistic, or at least a footnote clarifying the calculation.

* Line 424-425: Provide annotation details and explain what is implied under ground-truth structured data.

* The paper would benefit from a broader discussion on how the released dataset aligns with real-world data and practical applications.

* Line 452-455: The analysis seems to slightly contradict the observed findings: the majority of the models is said to show Analysis performance decline while 2 of 3 models show the accuracy increase.
