# ExDBSCAN: Explaining DBSCAN with Counterfactual Reasoning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 4, 4, 2

## Abstract
Clustering is an unsupervised technique for grouping data points by similarity. While explainability methods exist for supervised machine learning, they are not directly applicable to clustering, making it challenging to understand cluster assignments. This interpretability gap is evident in the popular density-based method DBSCAN, which assigns points as inliers (cluster members in dense regions) or outliers (noise points in sparse regions). DBSCAN does not provide insight into why a particular point receives its assignment or if it is robust to small changes in the data. To address the challenges, we introduce ExDBSCAN, a density-aware, post-hoc explanation method. ExDBSCAN offers actionable counterfactual explanations, with theoretical guarantees for validity. It generates multiple counterfactuals using a density-connected weighted graph while adopting a physics-inspired model that repels counterfactual candidates from one another (diversity) while pulling them toward the instance to explain (proximity). Empirical evaluation on 30 tabular datasets, confirms that ExDBSCAN attains perfect validity and shows that it retrieves diverse, proximal counterfactuals.

### Summary
The paper introduces ExDBSCAN, a method for generating counterfactual explanations tailored to the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Unlike existing model-agnostic methods tailored for supervised learning, such as BayCon, ExDBSCAN explicitly incorporates DBSCAN’s density-connectivity structure. The authors try to formalise this through a theoretical guarantee, and evaluate the method across 30 OpenML datasets using validity, proximity, and diversity metrics. Results show higher validity and comparable or better diversity and proximity than BayCon.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an underexplored area in explainable machine learning, i.e., counterfactual explanations for unsupervised, density-based clustering. It proposes counterfactual reasoning for DBSCAN. The author identify a conceptual gap between existing black-box counterfactual methods and the discrete, graph-based nature of DBSCAN, proposing a theoretically grounded alternative.

In terms of quality, the paper provides formal reasoning, including proofs for validity and NP-hardness, and conducts experiments across a broad suite of datasets. The evaluation framework (validity, proximity, and diversity) is decent. However, some metrics typical CF metrics are missing (listed under limitations). 

The presentation clarity is decent. The motivation is well contextualised against prior work.

Regarding significance, while the contribution is somewhat narrow, it fills a real methodological gap. The proposed approach could form a foundation for future extensions to other density-based or hierarchical clustering algorithms, and it contributes to the growing intersection of XAI and unsupervised learning.

### Weaknesses
The paper’s main limitations come from missing experimental and methodological detail (listed under questions). In addition, the contribution remains somewhat narrow, being tailored to a single clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) without discussing how the proposed approach could generalise or adapt to other forms of unsupervised learning.

### Questions
1.It would be helpful to describe in more detail how the ten BayCon counterfactuals per instance were chosen for evaluation. Since many counterfactual generators return a large set of counterfactuals, different sampling strategies may emphasise different aspects of performance. For example, selecting the highest-scoring counterfactuals might highlight quality but reduce diversity, while random sampling might empathise diversity. Clarifying this choice, or reporting both variant, would help interpret the proximity and diversity results more precisely.

2. Missing evaluation measures:
- sparsity or the number of features typically modified per counterfactual
- indication of computational cost (BayCon has several metrics related to this)
- indication of result variability (i.e., please report average values + standard deviation or some other measurement of results deviation)

3. Discussion points
- A short explanation on why the HDBSCAN-specific BayCon variant (Spagnol et al., 2024) was not included could help position ExDBSCAN more clearly relative to other density-based methods
- Can the method accommodate categorical or mixed-type features?
- Can the method explain new, unseen data points without rerunning DBSCAN? I believe this is is one of the highlights of the method proposed by (Spagnol et al., 2024)
- can the method be adapted to other forms of unsupervised learning?

### Summary
This paper introduces ExDBSCAN, the first method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. The work addresses a significant gap in explainable AI by bringing counterfactual reasoning which is a well-established approach in supervised learning to the domain of unsupervised density-based clustering. 
The paper makes three primary contributions. First, it introduces ExDBSCAN as the counterfactual explanation method tailored specifically for DBSCAN, capable of handling both noise-to-cluster and cluster-to-cluster transitions. Second, it presents a physics-inspired optimization framework that balances proximity and diversity. This framework models candidate counterfactuals as charged particles that repel each other while being connected to the original point via spring-like forces, with all distances measured through a density-connected weighted graph that respects DBSCAN's cluster structure. Third, the method provides theoretical guarantees.
However, many of the claims are overstated. They are merely natural extension of some previous works and amalgamating those work.

### Strengths
The paper makes three primary contributions. First, it introduces ExDBSCAN as the counterfactual explanation method tailored specifically for DBSCAN, capable of handling both noise-to-cluster and cluster-to-cluster transitions. Second, it presents a physics-inspired optimization framework that balances proximity and diversity. This framework models candidate counterfactuals as charged particles that repel each other while being connected to the original point via spring-like forces, with all distances measured through a density-connected weighted graph that respects DBSCAN's cluster structure. Third, the method provides theoretical guarantees.

### Weaknesses
Applying counterfactual reasoning to DBSCAN, while useful, represents an incremental extension of well-established counterfactual concepts to a new algorithm rather than a fundamentally novel approach to explainability. The contribution is narrowly focused on one specific clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), which limits its broader impact compared to more generalizable explainability frameworks.

The novelty primarily lies in combining these physics-inspired forces with the density-connected weighted graph representation. While this combination is tailored to DBSCAN, the individual components (repulsion for diversity, attraction for proximity, graph-based distances) are not novel. Graph representation is domain-appropriate but not novel: Using shortest-path distances in weighted graphs to measure similarity is standard in graph-based algorithms. The contribution here is recognizing that DBSCAN's density-connectivity should be modeled this way which is insightful but somewhat obvious given DBSCAN's definition. 

Guaranteed by construction, not theory: Theorem 3.1 states that counterfactuals are valid because they're placed within ε-neighborhoods of target core points. This is essentially guaranteed by the algorithm's design (Equation 4) rather than being a non-trivial theoretical result. The "proof sketch" simply restates the assignment definition.
Circular reasoning: The paper defines the assignment function (Section 3.1) specifically to make this guarantee possible, then claims the guarantee as a contribution. This is somewhat circular—the validity is built into the definition rather than being a surprising theoretical property. 
NP-hardness result (Proposition 2) is expected: Showing that the energy minimization is NP-hard connects to known results about maximum diversity problems. While formally establishing this is useful, it's an expected rather than surprising result, and the proof essentially reduces to known MDP hardness.
Proposition 1 is trivial: The observation that minimizing spring energy alone selects k-nearest neighbors is straightforward and requires minimal proof.

### Questions
Does the method's complete specificity to DBSCAN limit its scientific contribution? Have you considered whether your approach could extend to other density-based methods (OPTICS, DENCLUE), and if not, does this indicate the contribution is more engineering than research?

Why didn't you compare against fitting a surrogate classifier to DBSCAN's cluster assignments and then applying standard counterfactual methods? You mention this approach in Section 2 but dismiss it without empirical evaluation. Wouldn't this be the most obvious baseline?

You prove NP-hardness then use a greedy approximation. How much better is this than simply selecting k diverse points from the nearest neighbors? Have you ablated against simpler baselines like: (a) k-nearest core points, (b) farthest-first traversal on the graph, (c) random sampling from nearby core points?

You state "fixing the clustering" and defining assignment via ε-neighborhoods ensures validity, then claim guaranteed validity as a contribution. Couldn't any method achieve "perfect validity" by defining the problem to make it tautologically true? What makes your guarantee non-trivial?

### Summary
The paper introduces ExDBSCAN, a method for generating counterfactual explanations for DBSCAN clustering. ExDBSCAN directly exploits DBSCAN’s density-based structure to produce valid, proximal, and diverse counterfactuals. Given a factual point and a target cluster the method produces a set of k diverse counterfactuals belonging to that cluster. To achieve this, it determines k core points of the target cluster that are mutually distant (in DBSCANs connectivity graph) but close to the factual. Core point selection is based on greedy optimization of a cost function. For each core point a counterfactual is placed in its \epsilon-region on the line segment connecting the core point and the factual.

### Strengths
S1. It is the first attempt to compute counterfactuals in the context DBSCAN clustering.
S2. The method produces valid counterfactuals (belonging to the target cluster).
S3. It is interesting that two different types of distance functions are used. 
S4. The paper is well-written and easy to read. 
S5. Experimental results using several datasets are presented.

### Weaknesses
W1. The proposed objective formulation is typical, when multiple CFEs are needed: a diversity term plus a proximity term.  There are two major simplifications: i) the search is restricted to the set of core points and ii) minimization is performed in a greedy manner. Technical depth is rather limited. In the case of k=1 (one CFE produced), the approach is trivial.
W2. Although several datasets are considered, experimental comparison is insufficient: I strongly suggest to compare with an indirect approach where a surrogate classifier is build using the cluster labels and then CFEs are computed using one of the several available libraries for explaining classifiers. 
W3. In my opinion, the use of the natural metaphor does not add value to the presentation of the method. Also propositions and theorems seem to be trivial.

### Questions
Q1. See comment W2 above. The comparison with Baycon (which is agnostic) does not add value to the paper.
Q2. Why is it difficult to formulate the method considering the core points of all possible target clusters?
Q3. Since k CFEs are generated independently for each cluster, how the CFE sets obtained for several target clusters could be combined into a final set with k CFEs? 
Q4. The way that non-actionable features are handled should be better explained in the Appendix.
Q5. Is it possible to find the optimal solution for k=1 (one CFE)?

### Summary
The paper proposes ExDBSCAN, a counterfactual‑explanation framework tailored to DBSCAN. The method constructs a weighted graph over core points, then formulates an energy function that balances proximity to the instance being explained via a spring‑like attraction, and diversity among counterfactuals via electrostatic repulsion. The method maximizes weighted graph distance and minimizes l2 distance between points in a train dataset. The authors prove that every generated counterfactual is valid (i.e., lies in the target cluster) and that the underlying optimisation problem is NP‑hard. A greedy approximation algorithm is used, and extensive experiments on 30 OpenML tabular datasets show that ExDBSCAN attains perfect validity, lower proximity, and higher diversity than the model‑agnostic Bayesian baseline BayCon. The paper also discusses handling non‑actionable features and presents theoretical arguments for the optimisation hardness.

### Strengths
## Novelty
First method that guarantees validity for counterfactuals in a density‑based clustering setting.

## Theoretical grounding
Proof of validity, NP‑hardness, and a clear energy formulation that connects to physics.

## Empirical evaluation
Large benchmark (30 datasets), three metrics, clear visualisation.

## Practical relevance
Addresses a real interpretability gap for DBSCAN, which is widely used in many domains.

## Reproducibility
Code and data links provided; experiments are reproducible from the description.

## Clarity of motivation
The paper convincingly explains why existing CE methods fail for DBSCAN and motivates the physics‑inspired approach.

### Weaknesses
## Algorithmic description
The greedy procedure is only sketched. The counterfactual sampling algorithm is unclear. It would be better to provide pseudocode for the algorithm.

## Complexity / Scalability
Building the full $\epsilon$‑neighbourhood graph is $O(n^2)$ in worst case. No discussion of practical runtimes, memory usage, or scalability to high‑dimensional / large datasets.

## Baseline selection
Only BayCon is used. Other clustering‑aware CE methods [1,2] could provide a more diverse comparison. I am also interested in the comparison with the regular CE methods like DiCE.

[2] Spagnol, Aurora, et al. "Counterfactual Explanations for Clustering Models." arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.12632 (2024).

## Existence of counterfactuals
The paper guarantees validity of produced CEs but does not discuss what happens when no feasible counterfactual exists.

## Metric choice
Proximity is measured by Euclidean distance to the explained point, while DBSCAN may use other metrics. This metric might not be the best for categorical features. No sensitivity analysis to feature scaling or metric choice.

## Non‑actionable features
The handling of non‑actionable attributes is only briefly described; real‑world constraints (categorical features, monotonicity, bounds) are not addressed.

## Human evaluation
The metrics (validity, proximity, diversity) are quantitative but do not directly capture interpretability or usefulness to end‑users. This work would benefit from some example explanations provided by the proposed method and user-study.

## Statistical analysis
No significance tests are reported. The bar‑plot differences may be due to random sampling of points.

## Documentation of proofs
The NP‑hardness proof is sketched; a full formal argument would strengthen the theoretical contribution.

### Questions
1. Could you provide pseudocode or a detailed description of the greedy algorithm? How many iterations does it run, and what is its time complexity in terms of n (number of points) and k (desired number of CEs)?

2. Have you benchmarked ExDBSCAN on larger datasets (e.g., > 50k points)? What is the memory footprint of storing the weighted graph, and can you use approximate nearest‑neighbour techniques?

3. DBSCAN is agnostic to the distance metric; does ExDBSCAN require Euclidean? If a different metric (e.g., cosine) is used, how would the proximity and diversity terms change?

4. In cases where no actionable feature can change the cluster assignment, how does ExDBSCAN behave? Does it return an empty set or a “failed” flag?

5. Your non‑actionable feature treatment filters core points based on Euclidean distance in a subspace. How would you handle discrete features or domain constraints that are not Euclidean?

6. Have you conducted any user studies to confirm that the generated counterfactuals are perceived as actionable or informative? If not, could you discuss plans for such evaluation?

7. Why was Spagnol et al. 2024 or EACE not included? Would they provide a useful benchmark, especially for outlier‑related counterfactuals?

8. How sensitive are the counterfactuals to $\epsilon$ and $minPts$? If a suboptimal parameter set is used, do you still obtain valid counterfactuals?
