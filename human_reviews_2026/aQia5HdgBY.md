# Remember Before You Explore: Persistent Shared Memory for Zero-Shot Object Navigation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
In practical applications like home robotics, a single agent over a long lifespan or a team of collaborating agents must perform a continuous stream of tasks in the same environment. However, conventional zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) paradigms, which reset memory after each task, are inherently non-collaborative and inefficient for such long-term operations as they lead to redundant exploration. 
To bridge this gap, we introduce a Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) mechanism that allows single or multi-agent systems to accumulate and reuse semantic knowledge across tasks and agents. Our approach builds an Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM), decoupling scene memory from task-specific information and maintaining semantic consistency via weighted confidence updates. On top of this memory, we design a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) navigation strategy that propagates stored semantics into nearby navigable areas and performs line-of-sight checks for waypoint selection, enabling reasoning about objects that are currently occluded or distant. Experiments on public benchmarks, including HM3D and MP3D, have shown that our framework avoids redundant scene re-exploration and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.

### Summary
This paper introduces a Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) mechanism for Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON), aiming to improve efficiency in long-term or multi-agent scenarios by reusing environmental knowledge. The framework consists of a Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM), a 3D voxel grid updated via a confidence-weighted mechanism, and a Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) navigation strategy that queries this map. The authors claim this approach improves navigation efficiency (SPL) on simulated benchmarks (HM3D, MP3D) by avoiding redundant exploration. The paper is overall clear, technically sound, but its conceptual/practical contribution feels limited. See more in the weakness and questions section.

### Strengths
- The paper correctly highlights the significant inefficiency of stateless exploration in ZSON, which is a key bottleneck for practical, long-term embodied AI.
- The high-level idea of a persistent, shared semantic map (PSM) that is robust to some perception noise (TCSM) is a logical and appealing direction for the field.
- The paper is well-structured.

### Weaknesses
1. Insufficient Contribution & Lack of Practical Validation: The paper's contribution to the robotics community, which it targets, is undermined by a lack of practical validation. To the ICLR community, its novelty from a learning perspective is limited; it does not introduce a general-purpose learning principle, but rather a specialized application. I would focus to emphasis its to robotics community by following the weakness points:
- Simulation-Only: The entire evaluation is performed in a simulator. For a method claiming to solve a key problem in "home robotics," the absence of any real-world experiments, even a simple demonstration video on a physical robot, is a major omission. Without even small-scale physical validation, the claim of “practical efficiency” is overclaimed and the paper’s contribution is limited.
- Missing Runtime Analysis: The paper claims to improve "efficiency" (SPL), but this metric is about path length, not computational cost. Table 1 is conspicuously missing inference time / runtime analysis. A "persistent" system that is computationally too slow to run in real-time is not a practical solution.
2. Implicit Static Environment Assumption: The method appears to fundamentally assume a static world. The paper does not discuss how the TCSM would handle dynamic objects, changing furniture, or even opening/closing doors. This is a critical limitation that sidesteps one of the hardest challenges of long-term operation in real environments.
3. Parameter explanation missing: The parameter γ (used in Eq. 2) is not explained conceptually, only given as a constant in experiments. Since γ determines the memory update dynamics, its role and sensitivity should be analyzed through an ablation study.
4. Section 3.4 (BLOS strategy) lists procedures but lacks intuitive explanations or reasoning behind design choices. It feels more like code documentation than scientific exposition.
5. Superficial Handling of "Uncertainty": The paper claims to handle "prediction uncertainty" (Line 70), but the proposed solution (Eq. 2) is just a temporal smoothing of confidence scores. The downstream navigation (Sec 3.4) then appears to just take the argmax (highest confidence), rather than truly incorporating the uncertainty distribution into the decision-making policy.
6. Inherited Model Biases: The system's long-term reliability is entirely dependent on the upstream foundation models. The paper does not convincingly address how the map would defend against gradual degradation from systematic biases or errors from these models.

### Questions
1. Would it be possible to include a qualitative or real-robot demonstration video to validate the method’s practical relevance?
2. Could you provide a quantitative analysis of the memory (GPU) and computational (update/query time) costs of the TCSM? How do these costs scale with the size of the explored environment and the map resolution?
3. How different is TCSM conceptually from VLMaps or ConceptGraphs, apart from the weighted update rule?
4. Minor Clarifications & Typos:
- In Figure 3, the caption mentions "PSSM." Is this a typo for PSM?
- To better highlight the benefit of persistence in Figure 3, would it be possible to add the performance of a strong stateless baseline? Its performance should be a flat line, which would make the cumulative benefit of your method much clearer.
- Line 28 ("Object navigation challenges embodied agents...") is grammatically confused because it treats object navigation as an active subject that “challenges” the agents. This makes the sentence sound unnatural. A clearer phrasing would be: “Object navigation is a task in which embodied agents follow natural language instructions to locate a specified goal.”
- Please add a brief one-sentence explanation for "beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) cues" on its first use (Line 43).
- Please fix the non-standard quotation marks (e.g., L267, L280).

I am open to adjusting my evaluation based on the authors' responses during the rebuttal phase.

### Summary
This paper introduces a Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) framework for Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON), enabling agents to accumulate and share semantic knowledge across tasks and collaborators instead of resetting memory after each episode. The approach constructs a Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM) that maintains long-term semantic coherence through confidence-weighted updates and incorporates a Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) navigation strategy that facilitates reasoning and planning toward occluded or distant targets.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, logically structured, and easy to follow, demonstrating strong command of scientific exposition and clarity of presentation. The introduction and methodology sections are particularly well-organized, making the contribution intuitively understandable while maintaining technical depth. What’s more, the paper’s main strength lies in the design of the Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM), which provides a robust and principled solution for long-term semantic consistency. Its confidence-weighted update mechanism effectively suppresses noise and mitigates semantic drift, ensuring stable and reliable memory accumulation across tasks.

### Weaknesses
While the paper introduces a conceptually appealing paradigm (persistent shared memory for zero-shot object navigation), it faces several limitations that restrict its novelty and methodological clarity. From a conceptual perspective, the authors appear to conflate the notion of zero-shot navigation with that of map-augmented exploration. By introducing cumulative spatial priors, the proposed setting fundamentally alters the nature of the standard ZSON problem, blurring the line between zero-shot navigation and pre-mapped exploration. As a result, claims of zero-shot generalization become less well-grounded, and direct comparison with stateless baselines may not be methodologically sound. A clearer articulation of the problem definition and its distinction from prior-knowledge-based paradigms (see Questions 1, 7). Moreover, despite the proposed enhancements, the method’s performance remains suboptimal and lacks comparison with more recent state-of-the-art approaches, limiting the credibility of its empirical claims. (see Questions 2, 4)

### Questions
1. The proposed setting fundamentally redefines the standard zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) problem. Unlike conventional ZSON, which assumes navigation in entirely unfamiliar environments without any prior knowledge, the proposed setting transforms the task into a map-augmented, long-horizon exploration problem. Consequently, direct comparison with stateless ZSON baselines under identical evaluation protocols is methodologically unfair. It is recommended to compare with prior-knowledge-based methods such as HOV-SG.

2. The method’s performance remains suboptimal. For example, “FiLM-Nav: Efficient and Generalizable Navigation via VLM Fine-tuning” reports 61.7% SR / 37.3% SPL on HM3D, surpassing this paper’s results. The authors are encouraged to conduct comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and provide a deeper analysis of the proposed framework’s strengths and potential advantages.

3. The paper states that an off-the-shelf segmentation model is used, but the specific model and configuration are not disclosed. The authors should specify the employed model and include an ablation study to evaluate how different segmentation backbones influence overall performance.

4. I notice that the paper does not include any real-world experiments. Could the authors clarify whether this omission is due to the framework’s current implementation constraints? If so, what are the main limitations that prevent the proposed system from being deployed or tested on real robotic platforms?

5. The reference list contains several issues. For example, some entries (e.g., “Shuaihang Yuan et al., GAMap: Zero-shot Object Goal Navigation with Multi-scale Geometric Affordance Guidance, 2024”) lack publication venue information and proper formatting. The authors should carefully revise and standardize all references.

6. How many samples or episodes were used in the main experiments, only validation splits, or the full dataset?

7. The performance gain mainly arises from the gradual expansion of explored regions rather than intrinsic model improvements. As shown in Figure 3, with more time and prior tasks, the unexplored areas decrease, and the performance saturates—essentially approaching a fully prior-informed setup. This makes the task setting closely resemble the map-first-then-navigate paradigm, in which a complete map is built before executing the navigation task. In fact, such pre-mapped methods would likely outperform the proposed approach. The authors should reconsider this problem.

### Summary
This paper proposes a persistent shared memory (PSM) mechanism, in the form of temporally consistent semantic map (TCSM), to share accumulated knowledge across tasks and multiple agents in zero-shot object navigation. It also proposes a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS)-aware strategy to leverage this memory to enable efficient task planning. Through extensive experiments, the authors show that their method is able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths
The strength of the paper lies in its design of an efficient shared memory structure that enables efficient longer-horizon task planning. The preservation of temporal consistency in the map is also interesting. The paper is also well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
I am not convinced if the comparison in Table 1 is fair, since the task setup changes for this method vs the baselines. I believe it would be better to also compare against those baselines that use a semantic map, by not resetting their memory after each episode. In other words, I am not sure if the performance improvement comes from not resetting the memory after each episode (in which case other baselines under this setting should also have improved numbers) or due to the proposed architecture and the map.

### Questions
I have a few questions for the authors and would request them for more clarification:

1. Do you reset the memory for each scene and for each level in the same scene?
2. What is the map resolution or the granularity of each voxel?
3. How did you decide on the gamma in eq 2? Did you ablate on this? 
4. In both HM3D and MP3D ObjectNav datasets, the objects would be easy to capture in a 2D semantic map? Why did you choose a voxel map over a 2D map? Did you ablate on this?
5. Do you consider a depth based confidence to update the map (as in OneMap[1])? For example, this would be beneficial for occluded objects viewed from a distance.
6. For objects that span across multiple voxels, do you collate the information in some way? 
7. Conversely, if we want to keep track of different instances of an object (say, multiple chairs around a table), will this map be able to handle them?
8. How would you handle spatial queries on the map?
9. Can you elaborate on why SuccSPL metric has been used? What shortcoming of spl does it aim to mitigate?

### Summary
This paper proposes a memory-augmented framework to address inefficiencies in **Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON)**—a task where robots locate unseen objects without prior training—with a focus on real-world applicability (e.g., home robots, multi-agent teams). Its core innovation lies in two key components: the **Persistent Shared Memory (PSM)**, a collaborative knowledge repository that enables cross-task/ cross-agent memory reuse (avoiding redundant exploration), and the **Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM)**, a sparse 3D voxel map that updates object semantic information via weighted confidence (reducing noise and preventing long-term errors). The framework also includes a **Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) strategy** to plan paths for occluded targets by identifying "proxy goal regions," solving the issue of myopic wandering in baseline methods.  

Experimental validation on simulated datasets (HM3D, MP3D) shows the framework outperforms state-of-the-art ZSON baselines in key metrics (success rate, path efficiency) and scales effectively with multi-agent collaboration. However, the work has notable limitations: its novelty is constrained, as mapping and the exploration-exploitation trade-off are well-explored topics, and the framework builds on existing ideas without major breakthroughs; additionally, the absence of physical robot testing leaves unaddressed questions about its robustness to real-world perception noise (e.g., lighting, dynamic objects) and feasibility in practical deployment.

### Strengths
This paper exhibits several notable strengths: it addresses a critical inefficiency in conventional zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) by introducing a **Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) mechanism**, which shifts ZSON from isolated single-task execution to continuous, collaborative learning (aligning with real-world use cases like long-lifespan home robots or multi-agent teams) and eliminates redundant exploration; its core component **Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM)** uses a weighted confidence update to build a robust, efficient sparse 3D semantic memory that resists noise and semantic drift, avoiding the limitations of prior task-entangled or brittle maps; it further designs a **Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) navigation strategy** to enable agents to plan paths for occluded/distant targets, solving a key failure mode of baseline methods; the work is validated rigorously—achieving state-of-the-art performance on HM3D/MP3D benchmarks, with controlled ablations isolating component contributions and tests confirming scalability with memory size and multi-agent collaboration.

### Weaknesses
This paper has notable limitations regarding novelty and real-world validation: First, its core components lack sufficient groundbreaking innovation—mapping is a well-explored domain in navigation research, with numerous prior works focusing on semantic map construction, confidence-aware updates, and memory reuse, while the trade-off between exploitation (leveraging existing knowledge) and exploration (discovering new areas) has also been extensively discussed in embodied AI and reinforcement learning literatures; the paper’s Persistent Shared Memory (PSM) and Temporally Consistent Semantic Map (TCSM) largely build on existing mapping and memory frameworks, with no obvious breakthroughs in addressing these classic topics, resulting in limited overall novelty. Second, the absence of physical robot testing undermines its practical credibility: all experiments are conducted in simulated environments (HM3D, MP3D via Habitat Simulator), and without validation on real robots, the robustness of its perception system (e.g., handling real-world noise like lighting changes, occlusions, or dynamic objects) and the actual feasibility of the memory/navigation framework in physical scenarios remain unproven—this gap raises doubts about whether the method can be effectively deployed in real-world settings like home robotics, which is a key shortcoming for a work aiming at practical embodied AI applications.

### Questions
### 1. Questions on Novelty and Connections to Prior Work  
- Given that mapping and the exploration-exploitation trade-off are well-established topics in navigation research, could you explicitly contrast your **PSM/TCSM framework** with 2–3 most relevant prior works (e.g., semantic mapping with long-term memory, multi-agent exploration strategies)? Specifically, what unique technical choices (not just combinations of existing ideas) make your approach distinct from these baselines?  
- The paper mentions the framework addresses "redundant exploration" in ZSON, but prior works (e.g., [cite a relevant paper on memory-augmented ZSON]) also tackle similar inefficiencies. How does your method’s performance or scalability (e.g., with more agents/tasks) outperform these works beyond incremental gains?  


### 2. Questions on Perception Robustness and Sim-to-Real Gap  
- All experiments are conducted in simulated environments (HM3D/MP3D) with controlled sensory inputs. If deployed on a physical robot, how would your framework handle real-world perception noise—such as varying lighting, partial occlusions, or dynamic objects (e.g., a moved chair)? Are there any modifications planned for the perception pipeline to bridge this sim-to-real gap?  
- The **TCSM** relies on accurate semantic labels to update confidence weights. If the upstream perception model (e.g., Qwen-VL-Max) misclassifies objects (e.g., confusing a "sofa" with a "couch"), how does the framework prevent cumulative errors in the shared memory? Is there a mechanism to correct such mislabeling over time?  


### 3. Questions on Memory Design and Scalability  
- The **PSM** is described as a "shared cloud盘" for multi-agent collaboration. As the number of agents or accumulated tasks grows, how do you manage memory storage and retrieval efficiency? For example, would a large memory bank slow down real-time navigation planning, and if so, what optimization strategies (e.g., pruning redundant entries) are in place?  
- The paper notes performance "saturates as the map nears completeness." Could you clarify: What defines "map completeness" in your framework (e.g., coverage of all rooms, all object categories)? And once saturated, does the framework still adapt to minor environmental changes (e.g., a shifted table), or does it require a full memory reset?  


### 4. Questions on Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Strategy  
- The BLOS strategy uses "proxy goal regions" to navigate to occluded targets. How does the framework select these proxy regions when multiple potential points exist (e.g., two doorways that both overlook a target)? Is there a cost function (e.g., distance, navigation safety) to prioritize more optimal proxies?  
- In simulated tests, are there cases where the BLOS strategy fails (e.g., no accessible proxy regions for a fully enclosed target)? If so, how does the framework recover—does it fall back to exploration, or is there a contingency plan?
