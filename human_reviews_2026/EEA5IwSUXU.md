- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 4, 4

## Abstract
3D Gaussian representations have demonstrated remarkable success in reconstructing complex scenes and rendering novel views. 
However, rigging and animating template-free articulated objects represented by 3D Gaussians remain challenging. A key difficulty arises from the discretization of Gaussians, which often produces artifacts during animation. Another challenge lies in rigging arbitrary, template-free shapes without sufficient training data. To address these challenges, we propose A$^3$-GS, a new 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework that reconstructs articulated objects from multi-view images while simultaneously estimating a skeleton and skinning weights, thereby enabling rich animations with high-quality rendering. Technically, we first introduce a Mesh–Gaussian hybrid representation for articulated objects. By exploiting the continuity of the mesh, our method mitigates rendering artifacts such as spikes and tearing caused by Gaussian deformation, thereby enhancing the visual quality of animated results. We further learn motion-coherent skinning weights by leveraging motion priors from visual foundation models trained on large-scale 2D video data, reducing reliance on scarce 3D datasets. In addition, we incorporate local rigidity regularization to improve the smoothness of skeleton-based deformation and further suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating clear advantages over existing methods. The code will be made publicly available.

### Summary
This paper proposes A³-GS, a framework for reconstructing articulated objects from multi-view images and automatically rigging them for animation. The key contributions include: (1) a Mesh-Gaussian hybrid representation that binds 3D Gaussians to mesh surfaces to reduce animation artifacts, (2) leveraging motion priors from a drag-based image editing model (LightningDrag) to learn skinning weights without extensive 3D training data, and (3) incorporating ARAP regularization and a refinement module for smoother deformations. The method demonstrates improvements over existing rigging methods.

### Strengths
1. Novel approach to a practical problem: Using drag-based image editing models to provide motion priors for skinning weight learning is creative and addresses the scarcity of 3D rigged datasets.
    
2. Mesh-Gaussian hybrid representation: The combination of mesh continuity with Gaussian splatting for animation is well-motivated and helps reduce common artifacts.
    
3. Comprehensive pipeline* The paper presents an end-to-end system from reconstruction to animation with reasonable technical design.
    
4. Experimental validation: Quantitative comparisons on multiple metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, Geo-err) and ablation studies support the design choices.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited novelty and contribution in individual components: The Mesh-Gaussian binding closely follows GaussianMesh, and the skeleton extraction relies entirely on existing methods. The main novelty is in combining LightningDrag for skinning weight learning and the training strategy.

2. Missing comparisons with Gaussian-based animation methods. The paper claims superiority over discrete Gaussian methods but provides no experimental evidence: Lines 117-122 cite RigGS (Yao et al., 2025), ARAP-GS (Han et al., 2025), and other Gaussian animation methods, stating they "tend to exhibit artifacts" or "compromise rendering quality." However, Table 1 contains zero comparisons with any of these methods. All baselines (MIA, UniRig, Puppeteer) are mesh-based skinning weight predictors, not Gaussian animation methods.

### Questions
1. How sensitive is the method to the quality of initial skeleton extraction? What happens when the skeleton topology is incorrect?
    
2. The paper mentions LightningDrag is trained with ≤20 drag points and performance drops with more points. How does this limit the complexity of objects that can be rigged? Can you provide a failure case analysis?

### Summary
The paper aims to articulate a 3D avatar from multiview images. Since the input lacks deformation information, additional priors are required to guide the articulation. To learns the articulation, it first reconstructs the 3D object from the multiview images and binds the skeletons automatically. Then this paper proposes to use the priors from drag-based diffusion models for learninig the articulation: It generates videos following the designed drag signal. The linear blending weights are optimized from the generated videos.

The key novelty is the adoption of drag-based diffusion models over image-to-video or multiview video diffusion approaches. Their precise controllability simplifies and stabilizes the learning process. The paper also proposes the automatic way to construct the control signals to the diffusion models.

It demonstrates its superior performance on diverse characters over various baselines.

### Strengths
* Its main contribution—the adoption of drag-based diffusion—is well motivated. The paper provides a detailed discussion of the sources of deformation priors and compares drag-based diffusion with alternative approaches, effectively highlighting its advantages.
* It describes how to genrate the control signals to drag-based diffusions in details. As this is the core part, the details help understand the method.
* It shows better qualitative and quantitative results over other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
* Although the paper is titled “Animate Any Articulated Objects,” the demonstrated examples are limited to 3D characters. Common articulable objects, such as laptops, are not included in the results. This limitation may stem from the skeleton-binding algorithms adopted, which could restrict the reconstruction and articulation of non-character objects.
* The articulation is limited to part-wise rigid transformations. Although objects may exhibit secondary motions in skeleton-driven animations (e.g., the hair dynamics in the second example of Fig. 1), the paper does not demonstrate the ability to model such effects. While drag-based diffusion models are capable of capturing these non-rigid motions in 2D, the adopted 3D representation appears to constrain the articulation to rigid transformations only.

### Summary
This paper tackles the task of rigging and animating template-free articulated objects represented by 3D Gaussians. The paper adopts a Mesh-Gaussian hybrid representation for articulated objects, enhancing the visual results of animated results using the continuity of mesh. It then learn motion-coherent skinning weights by leveraging motion priors from visual foundation models trained on large-scale 2D video datas. The proposed method outperform baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper achieves better results than baselines by introducing additional drag-based image editing priors and optimization process.
2. The paper is overall well-written and easy to follow.
3. The idea of using drag-based image prior sounds reasonable to me since it can avoid the reliance on direct 3D supervision.
4. I appreciate the demonstration video.

### Weaknesses
1. The drag prompt of the image editing is generated by repose the mesh, whose skeleton is actually extracted by other feed-forward prediction method. Therefore, the method assumes that the base skeleton extracted is 'almost' right. Otherwise, the drag prompt cannot be generated reasonably.
2. The enhancement compared with baseline does not seem much as shown in Tab. 1.
3. The main focus of this paper is to use 3D Gaussians as the representation for rendering for higher visual quality. But with the development of Image-to-3D models like Hunyuan and TRELLIS, I just wonder what will happen if the rigging is operated directly upon the mesh. Some experiments regarding this would be helpful, also directly using mesh is more suitable for downstream usages in animation or game industry.
4. All examples shown in the paper are from synthetic datasets, some real-world examples would be beneficial.

I will be glad to raise my rating if my concerns are well addressed.

### Summary
This paper proposes A$^3$-GS, a new framework for animating articulated 3D objects grounded on a 3D Gaussian-Mesh hybrid representation. The pipeline starts with reconstructing the static representation and extract the skeleton through corresponding off-the-shelf methods. Main technical contribution lies in the following skinning weights learning stage, where the authors leverage the motion priors from drag-based image editing models as guidance. In particular, they automatically construct drag signals by moving the joints of skeleton to generate the dragged images, which serve as supervision signals to optimize skinning weights. A local rigidity regularization and refinement module further stabilize training and enhance surface smoothness. Experiments conducted on articulated object datasets exhibit superior deformation performance compared to state-of-the-art rigging methods.

### Strengths
* Effective Mesh-Gaussian hybrid representation: The Mesh–Gaussian hybrid structure elegantly merges the continuity of meshes with the rendering efficiency of 3D Gaussians, addressing the core limitation in Gaussian-based animation.
* Novel use of 2D priors: The adoption of drag-based image editing as a motion prior is both original and practical, enabling rigging without labeled 3D motion data.
* Comprehensive evaluation: Extensive comparisons against strong baselines (UniRig, Puppeteer, MIA, MagicArticulate) demonstrate consistent performance improvements across metrics.
* Robust regularization design: The use of ARAP (as-rigid-as-possible) loss and local refinement ensures smooth deformation and visually coherent animations.

### Weaknesses
* Underlying instability of 2D generative priors: The accuracy of skinning weight learning heavily depends on the behavior of the drag-based image editing model. When the editing model misinterprets motion semantics (e.g., head rotations), the generated supervision can become misleading.
* Limited motion diversity: Since only one joint is perturbed per training step, complex coordinated motions are not well represented during training, which could limit performance in highly articulated motions.
* Moderate technical novelty: The proposed pipeline largely integrates multiple existing methods (e.g., GOF for reconstruction, off-the-shelf skeleton extraction). The core contribution lies in the procedure for generating dragged multi-view supervision.
* Lack of efficiency analysis: As the framework is optimization-based, the authors should report the time required for the entire workflow to better assess its practical efficiency.

### Questions
* How robust is the drag-based supervision when extended to multi-joint motions or larger rotations beyond the trained range (±0.35π)?
* Have you experimented with fine-tuning LightningDrag on skeleton-conditioned data to improve its motion alignment?
