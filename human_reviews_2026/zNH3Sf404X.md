## Abstract
Detecting illicit cryptocurrency transactions is hampered by extreme class imbalance, adversarial obfuscation, and a scarcity of reliable labels. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabeled data, we show that its success is not guaranteed by data volume alone but is contingent on data quality. We introduce an SSL framework for identifying illicit flows in Bitcoin's Shared Send Mixers (SSMs) and make three contributions: (1) The first complete historical dataset of 163 million Bitcoin transactions with SSM classification; (2) Novel, high-fidelity features—KeyLinker address clustering and Shared Send Untangling (SSU) complexity metrics—designed to capture mixing structures and improve data quality; (3) A demonstration that SSL effectively leverages unlabeled data (F1-score: 0.84) precisely when guided by these quality-focused features. Crucially, we prove that common heuristics like One-Time Change (OTC), though abundant, introduce noise, while strategic reliance on higher-fidelity features like KeyLinker is essential. Our work establishes that in blockchain forensics, the path to better performance lies in smarter feature engineering for data quality, not just larger datasets.

### Summary
The paper studies the detection of illicit Bitcoin transactions and demonstrates the effectiveness of two new features, i.e., a clustering technique based on cryptographic key reuse pattens (KeyLinker, published in 2025) and the Shared Send Untangling complexity metrics (SSU, published in 2023). With experiments on a newly constructed dataset, these two features outperforms traditional heuristics for illicit transaction detection, especially the often used One-Time Change (OTC) features even decreasing detection performance.

### Strengths
The main strength of the paper is introducing the above two features for illicit transaction detection in Bitcoin.

### Weaknesses
The contributions of this paper are rather limited, and somehow I feel that this paper is a bit out of the scope of ICLR focusing on learning representation. The paper uses feature engineering to improve the performance of a few ML models (CatBoost, XGBoots, and RF). However, even those two effective features are not newly proposed in this paper.

The paper does not present the details of these two features, and the analysis in the end of Section 6 is rather simple and does not lead to any deep insights.

Section 3 can be better structured. After reading the related work, I cannot see how this paper will differ from them and what will be its new contributions.

### Questions
There are a few other types of approaches and features discussed in Section 3. The experimental evaluation can be improved by more comparison.

### Summary
The paper presents a semi-supervised learning framework for identifying illicit flows in Bitcoin;s shared send mixers (SSMs). The main claims are the classification of 163 millions of Bitcoin transactions, the the features-keyLinker address clustering and the experimental results showing quality focused features can enhance semi-supervised learning performance.

### Strengths
The problem of detection of illicit Bitcoin transaction flows is important and challenging especially in the presence of large unlabeled data.

The use of feature engineering to obtain quality features for high performance semi-supervised learning is widely recognized as a good practice. 

The related work covers some of recent Bitcoin literatures.

### Weaknesses
The paper needs to be significantly improved in both technical contributions and presentation. Here are some suggestions:

(1) The paper makes three claims: the classification of 163 millions of Bitcoin transactions, the features-keyLinker address clustering and the experimental results showing quality focused features can enhance semi-supervised learning performance on unlabeled Bitcoin flows. However, neither of the three claims are new in both concepts and technical development. The authors seem unaware of large literature and open source efforts in the detection of Illicit Bitcoin transactions. One example is the bulk of work based on the Elliptic dataset, e.g.,  the Elliptic++ (ACM SIGKDD 2023), which demonstrates the feasibility of detection of illicit Bitcoin transactions and illicit Bitcoin addresses with only small limited label data, with feature engineering, feature clustering and ensemble learning. 

(2) The paper lacks technical novelty in either data collection stage or machine learning for detection of illicit Bitcoin flows. 

(3) The experimental evaluation is poor and lacks the comparison to the state of the art methods for detection of illicit Bitcoin transactions/addresses.

### Summary
The paper presents a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to detect illicit transactions in Bitcoin's Shared Send Mixers (SSMs), with three contributions: a historical dataset of 163 million Bitcoin transactions labeled for SSMs; novel high-fidelity features such as KeyLinker address clustering and Shared Send Untangling (SSU) complexity metrics that capture mixing structures and improve data quality; and an empirical demonstration that SSL, when guided by these quality-focused features, effectively leverages unlabeled data achieving an F1 score of 0.84.

### Strengths
S1. The authors have released the first complete historical dataset of CoinJoin transactions, integrating on-chain analysis with off-chain metadata across Bitcoin’s entire history.

S2. The paper introduces novel forensic features - KeyLinker address clustering and enhanced Shared Send untangling metrics - that extract high-fidelity signals by decoding mixed transaction structures.

S3. The work shows that a semi-supervised framework outperforms supervised baselines by strategically leveraging unlabeled data, with success driven by feature quality (e.g., KeyLinker) rather than the volume of pseudo-labels.

### Weaknesses
W1. The technical contribution is limited. No new methodology, algorithms, systems are proposed. The novelty of the features is unclear, since they are derived from related work - KeyLinker Smolenkova & Yanovich (2025), an address clustering technique and enhanced Shared Send untangling metrics Larionov & Yanovich (2023).

W2. Beyond effectiveness, no other performance metrics are considered such as efficiency and scalability, interpretability, etc.

W3. The experiment is conducted on one dataset. How well the results generalize across multiple datasets is unclear. No specific case studies are demonstrated.

### Questions
The main bottleneck is the limited technical contributions. See all the concerns listed in Weaknesses.
