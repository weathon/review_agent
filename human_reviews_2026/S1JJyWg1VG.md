## Abstract
The Schrödinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a
  stochastic dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions
  that minimises a certain transportation cost.
  This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
  transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its
  connections to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its
  applications in the natural sciences.
  However, all existing algorithms enable the inference of such
  dynamics only for cases where samples from both distributions are available.
  In this paper, we propose the first general method for modelling
  Schrödinger bridges when one (or both) distributions are given by
  their unnormalised densities, with no access to data samples.
  Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the iterative
  proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case,
  inspired by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement
  learning for training of diffusion samplers.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
  IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn
  transports between multimodal distributions.
  As a secondary consequence of our reinforcement learning
  formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation scheme for
  the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schrödinger bridge
  algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
  coefficient of the dynamics.
  Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to the problem of
  sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
  models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for modeling SB when distributions are unnormalized, without accessing samples. This is generally called "data-free," and the proposed data-to-energy IPF procedure attempts to successfully learn transportation between multimodal distributions. The authors validate the approach in various circumstances, including high-dimensional image-to-image translation.

### Strengths
* This method is (partially) data-free using an energy-based interpretation; thus, it is likely to find considerable applications in restricted domains.
* The proposed scheme (Eqs. (7-8)) appears to be sound.
* This method can be efficiently outsourced, reaching sufficient scalability for image-to-image translation by using a pretrained latent model (possibly GANs).

### Weaknesses
* Limited scalability. The promise of scalability heavily relies on projected and cleaned modalities of embeddings. In other words, the model cannot be a head-first approach to solve an unknown problem, since this requires an unconstrained pretrained generative model.
* Limited comparison. Meaningful comparison studies are only present in synthetic datasets, with mixed results. I can find results from the references indicating that DSB variants show exceptional FID scores, often surpassing those of GANs. The authors are encouraged to report these scores, or acknowledge that their outsourced techniques share limitations on performance with pretrained GANs.
* Contribution. I understand the proposed method as a better-executed IPF with enhanced alignment with the model space. That being said, the manuscript does not successfully demonstrate the benefits of data-to-energy (or energy-to-energy) IPF, and the suggested numerical results contain a lot of overlapping regions, limiting the significance of the methodology.

### Questions
* I assume that the training time and memory requirement of Data-to-Energy IPF in synthetic (<50 dim) settings are good, but that it will suffer from the curse of dimensionality for image data (>1000 dim). Could you please give us the training time and memory requirements of standard and Data-to-Energy IPF procedures for various dimensions?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of data-to-energy generation on synthetic datasets, aiming to learn mappings between data-driven and energy-based distributions. To achieve this, the authors employ an Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure, which is essentially a variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, to bridge the two distributions through alternating updates. The method is evaluated on several synthetic problems, including posterior sampling in the latent space of generative models, and compared with standard data-to-data approaches.

### Strengths
- The paper presents an interesting conceptual perspective by framing the connection between data-driven and energy-driven distributions as a transport problem.

- The manuscript is clearly written and easy to follow, with a straightforward presentation of the core algorithmic idea.

### Weaknesses
While the proposed idea is conceptually interesting, I have several concerns regarding its scalability, novelty, and experimental rigor.

- **Computational inefficiency.** The proposed method employs standard IPF training, which is known to be computationally demanding. It requires simulating and storing both forward and backward trajectories, leading to significant memory and runtime costs. Moreover, due to the log-variance computation in Eq. (8), the algorithm must maintain multiple trajectories for each source sample $x_0\sim p_0$, further amplifying the computational overhead. This raises serious questions about the method’s scalability to high-dimensional or large-scale settings.

- **Limited comparison with related methods.** The paper does not include comparisons with existing and more scalable energy-to-energy [2] and data-to-energy [3] approaches. These frameworks perform only forward simulations, efficiently handle trajectory storage, and are generally better suited for practical applications. Although [3] may be considered concurrent work, it was publicly available nearly three months before the submission deadline and should at least be discussed for completeness.

- **Questionable experimental design.** The experimental evaluation is restricted to self-curated synthetic datasets and lacks standardized benchmarks, making it difficult to assess general applicability.

(1) On synthetic datasets, it would be more informative to include samplers capable of energy-to-energy or data-to-energy methods, as these are the most directly comparable baselines.

(2) The posterior sampling from latent formulated as $r(f(x), y) p_0(x)$ appears somewhat artificial and lacks a clear grounding in established probabilistic models. In contrast, a more canonical formulation sampling from energy-tilted data distributions $e^{r(x)/\alpha} p_{data}$ is well studied in the literature. For estimating $p_{data}$, the authors could have leveraged normalizing flows [4], continuous normalizing flows [5], or VAE/diffusion-based ELBO approximations that provide explicit or approximate log-likelihoods. Furthermore, comparison against rejection sampling seems too weak; many stronger training-based or training-free posterior sampling methods could serve as more relevant baselines.

(3) Evaluating the approach on more established and quantitatively meaningful benchmark tasks is required. At a minimum, incorporating comparative analyses against existing samplers on standard sampling problems would provide a more rigorous and convincing validation of the proposed framework.

Overall, the absence of experiments on well-established benchmarks and the lack of comparisons with efficient samplers substantially weaken the empirical claims.

- **Limited methodological novelty.** From a theoretical standpoint, the proposed formulation largely adapts the framework of [1] to the case where the energy function is defined on only one marginal. While this adaptation is logically consistent, it does not appear to introduce a fundamentally new methodological contribution beyond prior work.

### Questions
- How exactly is Langevin noise incorporated into the proposed method? Is it applied only at the final iteration, or added throughout the IPF trajectory?

- Does the method still converge or perform meaningfully without Langevin noise, or is it a necessary component for stability?

### Summary
This paper proposes a generalization of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure for Schrödinger Bridge (SB) estimation to settings where one or both marginals are given only by unnormalized densities (energy functions) rather than by data samples. The proposed data-to-energy IPF leverages a variance-based (VarGrad) objective previously used in diffusion samplers for unnormalized target densities. In addition, the paper shows that learning both drift and diffusion coefficients improves discretized SB optimization compared to drift-only models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method on synthetic 2D datasets (Gaussian, GMM, Two-Moons) and on latent-space posterior sampling tasks (StyleGAN, SN-GAN, VAE). The approach is further extended to an energy-to-energy SB variant, demonstrating fully sample-free transport between energy-based densities.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a generalization of IPF to the data-free setting, allowing SB learning even when only energy functions are available. This is an important theoretical and practical advance, broadening the applicability of SB to posterior inference and energy-based models.
- The authors provide extensive ablations on trainable variance and other off-policy reinforcement learning techniques, such as replay buffers, Langevin updates, and off-policy ratio.
- The inclusion of learnable variance meaningfully improves discrete SB optimization accuracy, especially at low discretization levels.
- The latent-space posterior sampling experiments demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The convergence guarantee of the proposed data-to-energy IPF (Eq. 7) is not established. While classical IPF has convergence results under certain regularity assumptions [1], it remains unclear whether those extend to the variance-based updates and off-policy sampling. A discussion of theoretical convergence would strengthen the contribution.
- The paper lacks comparison with a closely related concurrent work, the Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler [2], which also addresses SB estimation when one marginal is given as an unnormalized density. A direct comparison or discussion of methodological differences would clarify novelty.
- In Table 1, the Path KL metric is reported as “larger = better.” However, by definition, the SB objective minimizes KL (P ‖ Q), suggesting that smaller Path KL values should correspond to more optimal bridges. If the smaller Path KL is better, then the reported results appear to indicate a tradeoff: the trainable-variance model improves Wasserstein distance but worsens Path KL.  In this case, the justification for employing trainable variance under the tradeoff is required.

### Summary
The authors propose a modification of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to estimate a Schrödinger bridge between two distributions. Their approach does not require samples from either distribution, but instead relies on their unnormalized densities. At each step, they sample from the current approximation and add these samples to a replay buffer, similar to how it is done in reinforcement learning settings. They also explore the use of a learned diffusion scale coefficient in their framework and argue that this modification can improve any existing IPF algorithm. Finally, the authors demonstrate the performance of their proposed algorithm using synthetic toy datasets of Gaussian mixtures, as well as reward-driven energy estimations in the latent spaces of small generative models (GANs and Normalizing Flows), supporting potential applications to Style Transfer tasks.

### Strengths
* The idea is novel and natural, combining established concepts from Schrödinger bridges and entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. The choice of experiments to support the plausibility of the algorithm is adequate, though limited to toy examples.
* The theoretical foundations are well established, with an extensive literature review and a thorough background section on stochastic optimal transport and diffusion-based sampling. The appendix, which explains the metrics, is also well written.
* The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, although the experiment section is somewhat compressed in favor of the background overview.
* The paper demonstrates how the method could be applied to Style Transfer, but its main significance, in my view, lies in the thorough examination of the mathematical foundations.

### Weaknesses
* There are many unexplored applications for this method that would be more interesting to see in the paper. In particular, areas where unnormalized density is the primary source of information and data samples are very limited or nearly nonexistent—such as transferring molecular structures where energy or reward is given by physical simulation, or transferring grasping poses between different robot embodiments given a 3D object description. These examples would be better testbeds for the method’s applicability than outsourced image generation, as in the latter case it is difficult to distinguish between failure modes of latent-to-image generators and the method itself. Additionally, the source distribution in image generation is typically chosen to be Gaussian, which is again too simple and narrow for a comprehensive experimental overview. The authors do, however, mention in the conclusion that such experiments could be explored in future work.
* The FID discrepancy between rejection sampling and Schrödinger bridge samples is not well motivated and feels somewhat misleading, especially given the claim that the target distribution learned by the generative model is "ground truth." In reality, this may simply be a poor approximation.
* There are good analytical estimations in the literature for Schrödinger bridges between Gaussian mixtures, and for some reason, I did not find a measurement of the discrepancy between the learned bridge and the analytical approximation in these toy experiments.

### Questions
* Please try to examine and explain the findings regarding the FID discrepancy between Schrödinger bridge and rejection sampling in more detail.
* The paper could benefit from including more challenging distribution pairs, even in the toy setting, such as the widely adopted moons and swiss roll datasets, as well as higher-dimensional Gaussian mixtures.
