- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 4, 6, 2

## Abstract
We propose non-parametric estimators for the average run length (ARL) and average detection delay (ADD) in quickest changepoint detection (QCD) under finite and irregular sequence lengths. 
Although ARL and ADD are widely used as optimality criteria in theoretical and simulation studies, their application to real-world datasets is hindered by limited and irregular sequence lengths. 
To address this issue, we propose non-parametric estimators for the ARL and ADD, termed *KM-ARL* and *KM-ADD*, by drawing an analogy between QCD and survival analysis to model detection probabilities under sequence truncation. 
We derive estimation bias bounds and prove that they are asymptotically unbiased unless extrapolation is required.
Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate their practical utility, enhancing robustness against limited and irregular sequence lengths, improving interpretability, and facilitating empirical, intuitive model selection.
Our Python code are provided in the supplementary material and will be released upon acceptance, offering ready-to-use implementations for practitioners.

### Summary
This paper proposes nonparametric estimators for average run length (ARL) and average detection delay (ADD) in online quickest changepoint detection (QCD) settings with finite, irregular-length real-world sequences. By adapting the Kaplan–Meier estimator from survival analysis, the authors introduce the KM-ARL and KM-ADD estimators, derive their bias properties, and show they are asymptotically unbiased under standard regularity conditions.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a critical and practical challenge in QCD evaluation: accurately estimating metrics in the presence of sequence truncation and irregularity, which is common in real-world applications. The theoretical contributions are robust, including finite-sample and truncation bias bounds, and conditions for asymptotic unbiasedness.

### Weaknesses
While the theoretical contributions are nice, my concern is how much interest this work will attract from the ICLR community. As the conference name implies, this conference is primarily for researchers working on the theories, models, and applications of learning representations. However, I would still like to support this work based on its strong theoretical contributions.

### Questions
1. In Theorem 4.1, the stopping time $\tau$ and censoring time are assumed to be independent. Under what scenarios will this hold? Wouldn't that mean that the detector is a "weak" detector?

1. How can the KM-ARL in (2) and KM-ADD in (3) be computed numerically? 

1. The authors note that if "dependent censoring occurring just before event time (detection), estimation bias increases sharply". It would be interesting to see how much is the bias effect numerically to give practitioners a sense of the limitations of the approach.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating the performance of online change‑point detection methods. The authors are interested of two key metrics: the average running length (ARL) and the average detection delay (ADD). Inspired by survival analysis (and, in particular the Kaplan‑Meier (KM) survival function estimator), the authors introduce new estimators called KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD. The suggested methods aim to estimate ARL and ADD, respectively. They thoroughly study biases of KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD estimates. They represent the total bias into a sum of truncation and finite-sample biases. According to Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, the finite‑sample biases of KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD decay exponentially as the sample size approaches infinity. In addition, Theorems 4.3 and 4.4 demonstrate that the truncation biases associated with KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD are smaller in absolute value compared to those of conventional LB‑ARL and LB‑ADD methods. To further validate their approach, the researchers present numerical experiments using both synthetic and real‑world datasets. These experiments clearly illustrate the superiority of KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD estimates when compared to LB‑ARL, LB‑ADD, as well as to naive ARL and ADD estimation methods.

### Strengths
Strong theoretical guarantees on biases of the KM‑ARL and KM‑ADD estimates.

### Weaknesses
1. The variances of KM-ARL and KM-ADD remain unexplored. Could the authors comment on comparison of the variances of KM-ARL and KM-ADD with the ones of LB-ARL and LB-ADD?

2. According to Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, a statistician must know $T_{\max}^\star$ and $\Delta T_{\max}^\star$ to ensure that the KM-ARL and KM-ADD have smaller biases than their LB competitors. However, the setup does not describe the distribution of $T_i$'s, so it is unclear how to find $T_{\max}^\star$ and $\Delta T_{\max}^\star$ in practice.

3. The experiments in Section 5 were designed in such a way that the values of $T_{\max}^\star$ and $\Delta T_{\max}^\star$ were available. For this reason, it is not surprising that the KM estimators performed better than their LB counterparts. It is not clear how the KM estimators will behave if a statistician chooses wrong $T_{\max}^\star$ and $\Delta T_{\max}^\star$.

4. The last sentence in the proof of Theorem 4.4 (restated as Theorem B.5 in Appendix B.4): it is not clear why function $\mathbb E [ \Delta \tau \,\vert\, \nu < 0, 0 \leq \Delta \tau \leq \Delta T_{\max}] - \mathbb E [ \Delta \tau \,\vert\, \nu < 0, 0 \leq \Delta \tau \leq \Delta T] \geq 0$. I would prefer to see a rigorous proof of this inequality.

### Questions
1. Can the authors comment on the variances of KM-ARL and KM-ADD? How do they compare with the variances of LB-ARL and LB-ADD in the numerical experiments? Is it possible to prove rigorous theoretical results relating variances of KM-ARL and KM-ADD with the ones of LB-ARL and LB-ADD?

2. What happens with the KM estimators if a statistician chooses wrong $T_{\max}^\star$ and $\Delta T_{\max}^\star$?

### Summary
This paper addresses a significant practical gap in the evaluation of quickest changepoint detection (QCD) models. While the Average Run Length (ARL) and Average Detection Delay (ADD) are standard theoretical metrics, their application to real-world datasets is hindered because data sequences are often of finite and irregular lengths. This "truncation" or "censoring" leads to conventional estimators being highly biased and unreliable.

The authors propose two new non-parametric estimators, KM-ARL and KM-ADD, which solve this problem by drawing a novel analogy between changepoint detection and survival analysis. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the estimators, deriving bounds for the estimation bias and proving they are asymptotically unbiased unless extrapolation is required (i.e., estimating an ARL far beyond the longest observed sequence).

### Strengths
- Solves a Practical Problem: The paper tackles a clear and important real-world challenge. Anyone who has tried to apply QCD models outside of a perfect simulation environment will have faced the problem of evaluating them on finite, messy data. This work provides a principled and ready-to-use solution.

- Novel and Clever Approach: The analogy to survival analysis is insightful and allows the authors to leverage a well-established, powerful statistical tool (the KME) in a new domain.

- Theoretically Sound: The proposal is not just a heuristic. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation by deriving bias bounds and proving asymptotic unbiasedness. Decomposing the bias into "finite-sample" and "truncation" components clearly explains why the estimators work.

- Non-Parametric: The KME-based approach makes no assumptions about the underlying data distributions or how detection times are distributed (e.g., exponentially). This makes the estimators broadly applicable.

### Weaknesses
- The bias analysis for the KM-ADD (Thm 4.2) relies on an "independent censoring" assumption. The authors justify this with an approximation, but it remains a simplification that may not perfectly hold in all scenarios.
- The proposed estimators require a dataset with ground-truth changepoint labels ($\nu_i$) to be calculated. This is a significant practical limitation, as many real-world QCD problems involve unlabeled data. The method is therefore excellent for evaluating models on a labeled test set but cannot be used to estimate the ARL/ADD of a model in a general, unlabeled operational setting (where simulations are traditionally used).
- The paper's theoretical analysis focuses almost entirely on proving the estimators are unbiased. A rigorous analysis of the variance of the KM-ARL and KM-ADD estimators is explicitly noted as being out of scope. While empirical results suggest the variance is lower than baseline methods, a full theoretical understanding of the estimator's variance is a missing piece for a complete evaluation.

### Questions
- Though in Section 3, the analogy between changepoint models and survival analysis is well-explained. But the motivation and intuition of the original KM estimator, and the idea of the choices of $d_j$ and $n_j$ in the changepoint model, are unclear.

### Summary
This paper proposes nonparametric estimators for the Average Run Length (ARL) and Average Detection Delay (ADD), termed KM-ARL and KM-ADD, respectively. By drawing an analogy between quickest change detection (QCD) and survival analysis, the authors apply the Kaplan–Meier estimator to model detection probabilities under sequence truncation, addressing the challenge of limited and irregular sequence lengths.

### Strengths
- The paper makes a conceptual link between QCD and survival analysis, and proposes a potential alternative to Monte Carlo–based ARL/ADD evaluations when sequences are truncated.
- The empirical studies include both synthetic and real data examples.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I find the contribution limited in two aspects. Firstly and most importantly, the problem itself is of limited interest to the community. While the QCD problem is very useful and widely studied in practice, it is unclear how useful the proposed ARL and ADD evaluation methods are in realistic scenarios. I can imagine that in simulation environments, the proposed estimators could be used to approximate the ARL without simulating until the actual stopping time (which can be very time-consuming, as ARL values are often on the order of 10⁴ or 10⁵). However, even in such settings, the exponential approximation often provides sufficiently accurate results, and in some cases, closed-form expressions for the ARL already exist—allowing the detection threshold to be determined simply by solving an analytical equation. In real-world scenarios, where finite sequence lengths are common due to data collection constraints, the proposed KM-ARL and KM-ADD require multiple sequences to obtain the Kaplan–Meier estimator. This substantially limits the applicability of the proposed method, as in many practical situations there is typically only a single data stream for which detection is performed, and multiple independent streams with the same distribution may not be available. Secondly, the methodology itself is based on the well-known Kaplan–Meier estimator (KME), a standard technique in survival analysis, and therefore offers limited methodological novelty.

Moreover, the presentation could be improved for clarity; definitions and assumptions are sometimes imprecise or ambiguous (e.g., in Eq. (1)), see questions below.

### Questions
I have a concern about the definition of ADD in Eq.(1). Typically, in the QCD literature, there are two common definitions of detection delay. One is the conditional average detection delay, which involves taking an additional supremum over all possible change-points $ \nu = 0, 1, \ldots $ in Eq.(1); the other is the Bayesian setting, which further takes an expectation over the change-point $\nu$ in Eq.(1). Both metrics do not depend on a specific change-point $\nu$, whereas the definition in Eq.(1) does if I understand correctly. Since the detection delay can indeed vary across different change-point locations—as has been well documented in the QCD literature—the current definition of ADD in Eq.(1) is, in a sense, not precise. 
Moreover, as mentioned in Section 5 ("two types of change-point distributions: geometric and uniform"), I assume the authors are considering a Bayesian setting. If so, it would be more appropriate to use the commonly adopted Bayesian ADD definition. To my understanding, in Sec 5, the authors assign different (random) change-points for each sequence but estimate the ADD under the assumption that the detection delay distributions for different change-points $\nu$ are identical. This assumption does not generally hold for many detection algorithms.

For the real-data results, the authors conclude that the proposed methods “...reduce both bias and variance compared to baseline estimators...” While it is clear from Figure 1 that KM-ARL and KM-ADD can indeed reduce variance, it is not evident why they also reduce bias. In this real-world dataset with limited sequence lengths (and substantial censoring), there is no known ground-truth value for ARL or ADD to support such a conclusion.

Minor: It should be clarified in Eq.(1) whether the expectation is also taken over the randomness in the observed sequence length $T$, or if $T =\infty $ is assumed (i.e., no censoring).
