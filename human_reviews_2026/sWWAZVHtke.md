## Abstract
Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR) construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502 synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards. Through this rigorous process, we construct the first large-scale dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline to address the challenge of diagnosing psychiatric comorbidity. First, the paper creates PsyCoProfile, a set of 502 synthetic, clinically-grounded Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for patients with common comorbid disorders, derived from social media data. Second, the paper develops a multi-agent framework combining a hierarchical diagnostic state machine and the diagnosis context tree for diagnosis. Lastly, the paper introduces PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dataset of 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues for psychiatric comorbidity, which has been validated by licensed psychiatrists for its clinical realism and diagnostic validity. This work provides a crucial resource for training and evaluating models capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening.

### Strengths
1.The paper proposes PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset specifically targeting psychiaatric comorbidity.

2.The paper's claims are substantiated by a rigorous and multi-faceted evaluation protocol. The results, particularly the high realism scores in an AB test against real-world dialogues, provide strong evidence for the dataset's clinical plausibility and validity.

3.The paper is well-presented, facilitating a strong understanding of the work's mechanics and contributions.

### Weaknesses
1.The model simplifies clinical symptoms to a basic "yes/no" answer, losing the nuance of real-world diagnosis where symptoms can be mild or subthreshold.

2.The framework relies on a manually-crafted state machine. While it can guarantee clinical accuracy, this approach is rigid and labor-intensive. Scaling the system to include more diseases would require significant expert effort to design and implement new state-machine modules, making the entire pipeline difficult to expand.

### Questions
1.Could the authors clarify the release plan for the assets created in this work? Specifically, will the full dataset of 502 synthetic EMRs (PsyCoProfile) be released alongside the 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues (PsyCoTalk)? 

2.The paper demonstrates the quality of the dataset but does not establish a performance benchmark for models trained on it. To demonstrate the dataset's utility for downstream tasks, could the authors provide a performance report for a baseline model trained on PsyCoTalk for multi-disorder diagnosis? This would provide a crucial point of comparison for future works.

### Summary
This paper presents PsyCoTalk, a large-scale, clinically grounded dataset of 3,000 multi-turn psychiatric diagnostic dialogues generated from 502 synthetic electronic medical records.
The authors propose a multi-agent framework simulating doctor–patient interactions, guided by a Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine  and a Diagnostic Context Tree based on DSM-5 structured interview standards.

The dataset focuses on psychiatric comorbidity, i.e., the co-occurrence of multiple mental disorders. Expert psychiatrists validated the data for realism and clinical validity, finding that PsyCoTalk conversations are close to real diagnostic interviews. The authors argue that this dataset will support the development of AI systems for multi-disease mental health reasoning and diagnostic support.

### Strengths
The pipeline integrates SCID-5 logic, diagnostic state transitions, and contextual reasoning, providing a strong medical foundation rarely seen in synthetic dialogue work.

Combines multi-agent dialogue simulation with structured EMR synthesis — a novel hybrid between symbolic reasoning and LLM-based text generation.

First dataset to explicitly address psychiatric comorbidity through structured, clinically grounded dialogues.

### Weaknesses
The synthetic medical records and the generated dialogues come from the same design logic. The “doctor” agent is judged against data that the system itself produced. This makes it hard to know whether the model is learning genuine clinical reasoning or just reproducing patterns it already encoded.

The diagnostic flow treats symptoms as mostly binary (“present” or “absent”), while real clinicians deal with uncertainty, partial symptoms, and differential diagnoses. The result may teach models to classify too confidently.

The dataset only covers a small set of disorder combinations (mainly depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD). Other common co-occurring conditions like PTSD or substance use are missing, so “comorbidity” here is still narrow.

The evaluation mainly compares PsyCoTalk to versions of itself (with or without the diagnostic controller). There’s no test showing whether this data helps models perform better on external or real-world benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper presents PsyCoTalk, a clinically grounded dataset for psychiatric comorbidity diagnosis. It introduces a two-stage pipeline:
(1) PsyCoProfile, which constructs 502 synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) for patients with multiple co-occurring disorders (MDD, AD, BD, ADHD), generated from social media posts; and
(2) PsyCoTalk, which uses a multi-agent framework guided by SCID-5-RV (a DSM-5 diagnostic interview standard) to produce 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues.
The dataset is validated by psychiatrists and claimed to be the first resource that supports comorbid diagnostic reasoning in simulated doctor–patient interactions.

### Strengths
(1)Novel focus on psychiatric comorbidity: Unlike prior mental disorder datasets that focus on single disorders, this work explicitly targets psychiatric comorbidity, which is a clinically important setting.
(2)Multi-agent framework: Integrating doctor, patient, and tool agents under a hierarchical diagnostic state machine (HDSM) is interpretable.
(3)Psychiatrist validation: Involvement of licensed psychiatrists adds credibility to the dataset’s linguistic and diagnostic realism.

### Weaknesses
(1)Data effectiveness: Since all EMRs and dialogues are synthetic, derived from social media posts and LLM-based generation, can the dataset truly reflect authentic doctor–patient interactions? Do the linguistic patterns or emotional tone in these generated dialogues capture the depth and subtlety of real psychiatric interviews? Without any real clinical data for grounding or comparison, how credible is the claim of “clinical realism”?
(2)Simplified symptom representation: By reducing the SCID-5’s original four-point symptom scale to binary “present/absent” labels, does the dataset lose essential diagnostic nuance and symptom severity? How might this simplification affect the interpretability and downstream clinical reliability of models trained on such data?
(3)Lack of Inter-Disorder Relationship Modeling: If “comorbidity” here merely refers to co-labeled samples without modeling relationships or dependencies between disorders, can it truly represent comorbid diagnostic reasoning? Within the dialogues, do co-occurring disorders interact dynamically, or are they treated as independent diagnostic categories? To what extent does the dialogue structure capture overlapping or interacting symptoms?
(4)Evaluation limitations: Given that only 50 dialogues were rated by five psychiatrists, is this sample sufficient to demonstrate the dataset’s overall reliability, linguistic realism, and diagnostic accuracy? How representative are those 50 evaluated samples compared to the entire corpus of 3,000 dialogues, and how consistent are the expert ratings?

### Summary
This paper introduces a clinically grounded framework and dataset for diagnostic dialogues in the context of psychiatric comorbidity, aiming to bridge the gap between static medical records and interactive diagnostic conversations. The authors derive structured psychiatric dialogue data from clinical records and design a dialogue system that models comorbidity-aware diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes multi-turn dialogues reflecting realistic clinician–patient interactions and overlapping psychiatric conditions, a setting that is significantly underrepresented in existing diagnostic dialogue research.

### Strengths
- Clinically meaningful and socially impactful contribution. Psychiatric comorbidities are extremely common in real clinical practice, yet rarely addressed in diagnostic dialogue datasets. The paper fills an important gap by designing dialogues that reflect comorbidity patterns, symptom overlap, and ambiguity, which are critical challenges for mental health assessments. 
- Clear dataset design and annotation strategy. The paper provides a transparent methodology for constructing dialogues, annotating comorbid conditions, and representing psychiatric symptomatology in a conversation-friendly format. The schema and examples help convey the complexity handled by the dataset.
- Well-written and structured. The paper is generally clear and does a good job situating itself relative to existing medical dialogue datasets, noting that most lack comorbidity or clinically grounded language patterns.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of rigorous evaluation. The paper does not present systematic evaluation of the dataset’s usefulness beyond illustrative examples. No comparisons or user studies (e.g., models trained with vs. without this dataset) are provided to show the dataset’s impact on model performance or clinical reasoning.
- Limited novelty in methodology. The main novelty is the dataset’s domain focus. The data transformation pipeline is not sufficiently innovative or thoroughly justified for ICLR.
- The dataset description could better highlight diversity: e.g., demographic representation, cultural/linguistic bias, and how psychiatric conditions with culturally variant presentations were handled.

### Questions
- How do you envision safe and appropriate use of this dataset, given the risk of non-professional misuse of psychiatric diagnostic tools?
- Were any psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or licensed clinicians involved in reviewing the dataset or annotation guidelines? If so, please include details.
