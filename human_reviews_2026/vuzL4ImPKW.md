- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 2, 4, 2

## Abstract
Multivariate time series forecasting has experienced a surge in interest recently. However, significant challenges remain in effectively modeling the multi-level dependencies among time points, sequences, and channels. Existing methods often struggle to fully capture the hierarchical relationships between these three aspects or face efficiency issues. To address this, we propose HyperTime: Hyperbolic space hierarchical constraints for multivariate Time series forecasting. This method initially segments the time series into patches and then extracts temporal dependencies to obtain representations for each channel. It subsequently derives interrelationships among multiple channels based on these representations, encoding time patches, individual channels, and multi-channel series into a unified hyperbolic representation space. By imposing hyperbolic hierarchy and entailment constraints on the encoded representations, the method leverages relationships from local to global among the three levels, ensuring sufficient interactions among point, intra- and inter-channel information. We evaluated HyperTime on several commonly used multivariate time series forecasting datasets and compared it with previously top-performing models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HyperTime, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only linear complexity. This highlights its proficiency in capturing complex temporal dependencies and interrelationships among channels. Our code is included in the supplemental material and will be released open-source.

### Summary
The paper introduces Hyperbolic Space Hierarchical Constraints to enhance the representation of multivariate time series. The technique includes a multi-level constraint-based loss and corresponding modules, effectively enhance the prediction performance. I think this is an interesting and insightful paper, but the current representation quality is not so well. I encourage the authors to add some more necessary experiments and improve the representation quality, which can make this paper a better work.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides a novel perspective for time series representation learning. Compared with E-distance constraints,  Hyperbolic Space Hierarchical Constraints can help to bring a more robust and cost-efficient representation. The overall solution, HyperTime, can bring novel insights for readers.
2. The paper provides relatively adequate experimental results, and validates the effectiveness of the proposed Hyperbolic Space Hierarchical Constraints in both ablation study and representation analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack ablations on different hierarchical constraints. The paper only considers suming the loss of all three levels, as mentioned in Eq. 8. Do all three constraints bring positive effects to the final performance, or some may bring negative effects? Also, similar ablations should be considered in HEL(Eq. 9). Further experiments should be conducted to validate this concern. 
2. Lack ablations on Hyperbolic space v.s. Euclidean space. Since the paper demonstrates the advantages (performance and effeciency) of Hyperbolic space representation constraints against Euclidean space constraint, this paper do not provide experimental results to support this. What's the model's performance when using Euclidean distance to constraint the representation? **I think this is a core experiment that supports the technical claims of the paper.**
3. Full results on all specific predicition windows should be provided, as the aggregated metrics (average) may lose much of the detailed information from the experimental results. Also, some results differ significantly from those reported in the original paper (SOFTS) and existing benchmarks (patchtst in TFB), which may affect the credibility of the findings. Could the authors provide some explanations for this discrepancy?
4. Some presentation errors and suggestions . (1) Wrong cite format. Please revise your cite format in this paper. (2) I recommend the authors to adjust some tables' size in the paper for a better representation.

### Summary
This paper introduces HyperTime, a framework for multivariate time series forecasting that leverages hierarchical constraints in hyperbolic space. HyperTime segments time series into patches, extracts intra- and inter-channel dependencies, and encodes these into a unified hyperbolic representation space using the Lorentz model. The main contribution lies in introducing two novel constraints—Hyperbolic Triangle Loss (hierarchy constraint) and Hyperbolic Entailment Loss (entailment constraint)—to enforce and model multi-level dependencies across time patches, single channels, and multiple channels. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate HyperTime’s competitive performance and efficiency against state-of-the-art baselines, with comprehensive ablation, zero-shot, and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses supporting its claims.

### Strengths
**S1 Principled Motivation & Sound Architecture**: The proposal to model explicit hierarchical relationships in multivariate time series via hyperbolic geometry is conceptually sound, building on the exponential growth property of hyperbolic space to mirror hierarchical structures (see Figure 2). The formulation of hierarchy and entailment constraints distinguishes local-to-global semantics in the learned representations.

**S2 Efficiency and Scalability Demonstration**: The computational complexity is carefully analyzed (see Table 3), showing linear scaling in both the number of channels and input length. This positions the method as more efficient than many existing alternatives without sacrificing performance, as further reflected in Figure 6.

### Weaknesses
**W1 Limited Hyperbolic Representation Justification and Analysis:** While Section 3 provides some theoretical rationale for hyperbolic modeling, it largely relies on analogies or references to existing works (e.g., “hyperbolic allows distances to grow exponentially” on Page 2) rather than offering civil, dataset-specific evidence that such explicit hierarchy structures exist widely in the evaluated benchmarks. The approach, motivated by presumed hierarchy, would benefit greatly from a more directly empirical or formal characterization (e.g., quantifying or visualizing the presence of such hierarchies in standard datasets before and after applying hyperbolic constraints).
Figure 2 offers schematic illustration only; a more formal theoretical or empirical analysis justifying the claim that patches, single channels, and multi-channels indeed follow a strict hierarchy in these real-world benchmarks would significantly bolster the work.
Ambiguity and Under-specification in Mathematical Formulations:

**W2 Several notational inconsistencies, ambiguities, and lack of detail pervade the key equations.** For example, in Section 3.3, the notation used in Equation 4 ($C^{j}=S_{i}^{1} \circ S_{i+1}^{2} \circ \cdots$) is not sufficiently clarified—specifically, what objects are being concatenated, and along which axes? Similarly, “Repeat” in the representation fusion block is not defined (Page 5, Equation following “Representation Fusion”), potentially confusing the exact operational semantics in high-dimensional embeddings.
The formal description of angle ($\mathfrak{A}$) and distance ($\mathfrak{D}$) in hyperbolic space (Section 3.1) might cause confusion: the role of temperature/scaling parameters, referencing of “root,” and practical computation are under-specified.
Hyperparameters such as $\alpha$, $\beta$, and threshold $t$ in the loss functions (Equations 8–9) are not justified. The reader is left in the dark as to how they are chosen, how sensitive results are to their values, or whether these values generalize. This point is underscored by the limited sensitivity analysis on these hyperbolic-specific hyperparameters, in contrast to standard neural setup (Figure 5).

**W3 Insufficient evidence proves that the method is really useful:** This paper only evaluates on a limited number of traditional benchmarks. It is recommended to test on more benchmarks to effectively demonstrate the model's performance, such as GIFT-EVAL, FEV-Bench, and TFB. Additionally, it lacks comparisons with the latest strong baselines, such as TimeMixer++, OLinear, TimeBridge, and TimePro.

### Questions
**Q1** Can the authors quantitatively or visually demonstrate that the benchmark datasets used possess (latent or explicit) hierarchical dependencies suitable for hyperbolic modeling? Are there dataset characteristics or pre-analyses (e.g., hierarchical tree representations) justifying this geometric assumption?

**Q2** What strategies are used to set and tune the hyperbolic-specific hyperparameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, threshold $t$, or curvature $c$? How sensitive is performance to these choices on different benchmarks?

**Q3** Are there any numerical instabilities observed when training with Lorentz-based operations, and what practical measures, if any, are taken to prevent divergence/overflow?

**Q4** Can authors provide concrete empirical metrics—such as wallclock time, GPU memory use, or scalability with increasing $L$ or $C$—to substantiate claimed linear efficiency improvements over quadratic or logarithmic baselines?

**Q5** Would the method degrade gracefully if applied to a setting lacking any inherent hierarchical relationships? For instance, what are the empirical results if applied to univariate forecasting or quasi-flat data?

**Q6** How does HyperTime perform if critical components (e.g., patch representation, MLP in TDM/MDM, or explicit inter-channel dependency modules) are replaced by alternative neural network structures, such as convolutional or transformer mechanisms?

### Summary
This paper proposes the HyperTime model for multivariate time series forecasting tasks, which encodes temporal blocks, individual channels, and multi-channel sequences into a unified hyperbolic representation space. By imposing hyperbolic hierarchy and entailment constraints on the encoded representations, it ensures sufficient interaction between point-level information, intra-channel information, and inter-channel information, thereby addressing the issue that existing methods struggle to fully capture the hierarchical relationships among these three aspects while improving efficiency.

### Strengths
1. The work innovatively introduces hyperbolic space constraints and effectively divides time series into three hierarchical levels—temporal blocks, individual channels, and multi-channel sequences—while ensuring interaction among these information types through two constraints.
2. The experiments are comprehensive and robustly support most of the claims made in the paper.
3. The workflow of this paper is very clear.

### Weaknesses
1. In the HEL loss, a threshold t is set uniformly across the three perspectives (point, intra-channel, inter-channel). However, the referenced MERU method calculates thresholds separately. Could you clarify how t was determined? Would separate thresholds yield better performance?
2. The paper uses S (blocks), R (sequences), and D (multivariate sequences) to model entailment. However, R inherently contains multivariate information, suggesting it may not represent a univariate sequence. Does this imply that the relationship between R and D is not purely entailment, but rather that D augments R with additional multi-channel dependencies captured by MDM?
3. The font size in Table 2 is excessively large.
4. The paper does not specify the configuration of hyperparameters α and β in HTL and HEL, nor does it explore the impact of different hyperparameter settings on model performance.
5. Most operations in the framework are the existing techniques in time series domain. It is better to clarify how novelty lies in the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper presents **HyperTime**, a framework that leverages **hyperbolic representation learning** for multivariate time series forecasting. The proposed approach aims to model the hierarchical relationships among **time patches**, **single channel**, and **multiple channels** within time series data. By mapping representations from different levels into hyperbolic space, the method seeks to better preserve the intrinsic hierarchical relationship that is difficult to capture in conventional Euclidean geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperTime achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
- The proposed framework leverages hierarchical modeling to capture temporal relationships, providing a promising direction for representation learning in time-series data.

- The experiments are conducted on multiple widely used benchmarks, achieving low computational complexity while showing consistent performance improvements.

### Weaknesses
* **Unclear rationale and contributions:** The technical contributions remain vague. It is unclear how the proposed method differs from existing hyperbolic representation learning approaches or what specific advantages it offers. In particular, during the Euclidean encoder’s feature extraction, is the hierarchy between patch-level and channel-level representations already captured?

* **Unsupported key claims:** The experimental evidence does not convincingly support the claimed hierarchical structure. For instance, Figure 4 only visualizes pairwise distances rather than the hierarchy itself, while Figure 2 shows low-level patch features near the center and high-level multi-channel features near the boundary—but the rationale behind this spatial arrangement is not clearly articulated. 

* **Insufficient parameter justification:** The selection of the negative curvature parameter ($c$) and the angular threshold ($t$) in hyperbolic space lacks explanation. How sensitive is the prediction performance to these parameter choices?

* **Notation inconsistencies:** The notation appears inconsistent. For example, the symbol $C$ is used with different meanings in Eq. (4) and Eq. (6), which could confuse readers.

### Questions
* In Figure 1, the relationship between the output of the HSHC module and the decoding output remains unclear.
* In Equation (9), the angles intended to represent the entailment relationship require further detailed explanation to verify their correctness.
