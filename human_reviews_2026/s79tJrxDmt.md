## Abstract
Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky, expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected 50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information. Experiments on our new DailySense dataset—the first to enable ExG-based analysis across five human senses—together with four public ExG benchmarks, demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks.

### Summary
The author introduces a new design of earphone based wearable device incorporating several electrode sensors to capture EEG, EOG, and EMG. A new benchmark dataset DailySense, containing 50 hours of data from 22 participants, is proposed. A paradigm pre-trained model is presented and indicates leading performance across several downstream human sensing tasks against baselines.

### Strengths
- From the hardware design perspective, the design of the proposed wearable is ingenious. The earbuds based device is able to capture brain activity, heart activity, and facial muscle activity simultaneously. The device is lightweight and low-cost. 
- From the modeling perspective, the proposed Physiology informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiFT) is novel. The design of this tokenization process is reasonable in handling the sensing data with multiple channels and varied frequency-band of interest. 
- The experimental results are comprehensive, where varied baselines are included in comparison. Ablation studies are conducted to justify the efficiency of the proposed components.

### Weaknesses
## The modeling approach requires some additional justification. 
- If the emphasis is on the proposed PiFT mechanism, then it would be better to show that the gain in performance is consistent and independent of the backbone. The experimental setting could either be:
    - 1) With PiFT fixed, other than just modeling with Bidirectional Mamba, also model with other backbone such as Transformers. 
    - 2) With the same backbone, compare PiFT performance against other different tokenization mechanisms, for example short term Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform which are widely used in signal processing applications. 
- Recognizing the relatively higher uncertainty (due to more hyper-parameters and configuration) and timely cost on evaluate models’ representation with finetuning, I would suggest evaluate with linear probing, and compare against several recent and open-sourced (i.e. can be used off-the-shelf) models that are pretrained on wearable signals and the design of the model are intend to be channel agnostic, such as CBraMod [1] and NormWear [2]. 

## There are some limitations on the collected data. 
Since collecting data often contain difficulties, given the thoughtful device design and reasonable modeling scheme, this issue is not a major concern, but it still deserves to be mentioned. 
- The size of the collected data is a bit limited, where 50 hours of wearable signals from 22 participants is considered a small dataset in the wearable sensing domain. Also the demographic diversity of the dataset is also a limitation. 
- The downstream tasks constructed from the collected dataset tend to be relatively straightforward, with the majority formulated as binary classification problems.
- A well-rounded data sheet reporting the statistics of the collected data and the 4 public datasets will improve the presentation a lot. For example, the total hours of data, participants information, and distribution of different sensor signals, etc.

### Summary
This paper introduces pre-training methods and a new tokenization scheme for electrophysiological (ExG) signal modeling.  Their proposed pre-training methods and Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization scheme aim to address the challenge of ExG model generalization.  Evaluated on common ExG benchmark datasets, the introduced models outperform existing baselines.  The authors additionally collect the DailySense dataset, a free-living dataset of ExG data collected while participants perform tasks targeting different human senses, to further benchmark the generality of their proposed model.

### Strengths
- The authors tackle the important challenge of model generalization in ExG modeling.  In many cases in this modeling domain, generalization is largely accounted for with dataset scale, requiring more resources.  However, the novel tokenization scheme proposed in this work achieves improvements in generalization by developing an encoding scheme that seeks to explicitly account for known physiological principals of ExG signals.
- Proposed strategies (pre-training and PiMT) consistently outperform baseline models across a variety of common (and new) benchmarks. 
- Ablation studies are provided to verify the relevance of different pre-training strategies, frequency bands, backbones, and other design choices.

### Weaknesses
- The physiologically informed aspect of PiMT assumes electrode configurations that can yield signals of interest at each frequency band and does not account for mixing of these signals, potentially limiting generality of the scheme to different hardware configurations.  For instance, computing EOG signal features from occipital electrodes may not have much physiological meaning (the model would still likely learn features relevant to the training task, but the physiological intuition diminishes). 
- Baseline models evaluated in Table 1 are all evaluated on data collected from NeuroBuds.  These baselines may not be readily applicable to minimally pre-processed data and performance improvements may be observed when using data that has been processed further.  PiMT explicitly performs filtering across various frequency bands of interest, so implicitly includes additional preprocessing that other methods may not benefit from.

### Questions
- What is the performance of the model without PiMT but with a proposed pre-training strategy?  Can other model architectures benefit from a similar pre-training strategy? If I am understanding correctly, table 1 shows model performance with and without pre-training but always uses PiMT. 
- The results of this work primarily tackle task-generalization.  Do you expect that this physiologically informed tokenization scheme can also help extract features that are beneficial for cross-subject generalization?
- After fine-tuning, how well do the learned features generalize to the evaluation tasks of interest when the encoder is completely frozen (as opposed to enabling task-specific model updates during fine-tuning)?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new framework for scalable, task-agnostic Electrophysiological (ExG) signal representation learning from earphone-based sensors. To address data diversity and task specificity limitations of existing approaches, the authors develop a wearable hardware platform (“NeuroBuds”) and collect the DailySense dataset, comprising 50 hours of free-living recordings and 20 hours of labeled, multi-sensory data spanning the five human senses. The proposed Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT) method decomposes ExG signals into 12 pre-defined, physiologically meaningful sub-bands, enabling generalizable tokenization. The model is pre-trained using self-supervised multi-task reconstruction and then fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments benchmark performance against standard baselines across both the new DailySense dataset and four public ExG datasets, with results indicating significant improvements in generalization and accuracy.

### Strengths
1. Ambitious Data Collection and New Benchmark: The DailySense dataset, comprising the largest known free-living ExG recordings across diverse human activities and all five senses, marks a significant step toward real-world applicability for physiological sensing. The use of an earphone-based device (NeuroBuds) demonstrates strong engineering innovation, promising unobtrusive and scalable physiological monitoring.

2. Principled Tokenization Approach: The PiMT framework’s multi-band tokenization sits on a solid physiological basis, decomposing signals into 12 canonical sub-bands. This overcomes the usual artificial rigidity of task-specific band choices and supports more generic, transferable representations. The explicit mapping of ExG modalities to sub-bands is clearly visualized and justified in both Figure 1 and the accompanying methodology.

3. Thorough Experimental Validation: The paper conducts comprehensive comparisons against traditional and state-of-the-art baselines (SVM, DeepConvNet, EEGNet, PatchTST, EEGConformer, Bidirectional-Mamba), with both within-dataset and cross-benchmark evaluations. Ablations and analyses deepen understanding of where the gains come from and how PiMT generalizes.

4. Foundation Model Potential: By combining self-supervised pre-training on free-living data with a flexible multi-band tokenization scheme, PiMT takes a meaningful step toward a foundation model for ExG. The method is not tied to any specific task or sensor configuration, and its performance gains across diverse tasks and datasets suggest that it learns robust, general-purpose representations. This is a notable advance in a field often dominated by narrow, task-specific models.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited Generalization to Unseen Subjects and Modest Cohort Size: While the participant count (N=22) is comparable to prior lab-based ExG studies, it remains insufficient to support strong claims of robust population-level generalization. This limitation is clearly evidenced by the significant performance drop in the cross-subject setting (Table 7), where the average F1-score falls to ~58%. Although the authors acknowledge this challenge and provide Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) results (Figure 7), the sharp decline underscores that user-independent modeling remains a substantial hurdle. The current work is a robust proof-of-concept rather than a fully generalizable solution. Future work would benefit from larger-scale recruitment to better address subject variability.

2. Ambiguity in Filter Bank Implementation and Saliency Analysis: The physiological basis for the 12 frequency bands is well-motivated, but the practical implementation lacks critical details, which may hinder reproducibility. The manuscript does not specify key filter parameters (e.g., filter type, order, transition bandwidth, or handling of overlapping bands like EMG-Low and EEG-Beta/Gamma). These details are crucial for replicating the tokenization process.

3. Lack of Statistical Significance Testing: The reporting of mean performance with standard deviations is standard practice, but it is not sufficient to firmly establish the superiority of a proposed method over multiple strong baselines. The absence of statistical significance tests makes it difficult to assess whether the observed improvements (e.g., the 4% F1-score gain in Table 1) are statistically reliable, especially given the variability inherent in physiological data. Incorporating such tests would greatly strengthen the quantitative claims.

4. Insufficient Validation of NeuroBuds Signal Quality Against Gold Standards: A key selling point of the work is the novel NeuroBuds hardware. However, the validation of signal quality is primarily indirect, relying on downstream task performance. To fully establish the device's credibility for research use, a more direct, quantitative comparison with a clinical-grade or research-standard ExG system (even on a small subset of participants) would be highly valuable.

### Summary
This work built an earphone-based prototype for ExG data collection. The paper built a dataset consisting of 50 hours of free-living data, and 20 hours of task-specific data based on this new prototype. The paper further proposed a machine learning method called physiology-informed multi-band tokenization (PiMT) that learn representations from the ExG signals. The method is experimentally validated on both the collected dataset, and also four public ExG benchmarks.

### Strengths
- Solid prototype building and dataset collection efforts. The dataset is gonna be highly valuable to the community if made public, especially considering its multimodality nature and the study design that covers a wide range of tasks of interest.
- Solid experimental efforts. The method is applied on a wide range of tasks, including both private datasets and public datasets, and showed good performance.
- Very interesting saliency analysis, showing both how different frequency components are being effective differently on different tasks, and also shows how the multimodal ExG dataset is being effective such that it allows researchers to analyze such frequency components.
- Interesting experiments in section 5.5, showing increasing pre-training data at scale can improve performance.

### Weaknesses
1. It is unclear if the self-collected dataset is superior comparing to existing non free-living datasets. Specifically:
- The paper lacks experiments showing how the free-living dataset compares to existing larger-scale pre-training datasets, for example, the multimodal sleep datasets that contains thousands of hours of data (You snooze you win challenge, or TU datasets, as used in [1, 2, 3]). The paper hypothesize the potential benefits of collecting free-living ExG data, but the experimental results do not demonstrate as such. To demonstrate the self-collected datasets are effective, the authors should consider comparing the pre-training benefits based on the new dataset, and compare against the pre-training benefits given by using (1) 50 hours of existing datasets; (2) >>50 hours of existing datasets, and compare performance differences.

2. The technical details of the proposed method are unclear, and the reported numbers are way off the range of existing numbers, leading to doubts and questions about their experimental settings. For example, in papers like [4], they report around 40% balanced accuracy on SEED-V dataset and around 54% balanced accuracy on BCI competition, which is the state-of-the-art performance that is commonly reported. Yet in this paper, there is 82% accuracy on SEED dataset (which one?) and 69% accuracy on BCI competition, which leads to concerns - have the authors used the common metrics like balanced accuracies? Also, the performance reported on SleepEDF seems to be quite low, see [2, 5], which both reported 83%-85% accuracy on SleepEDF. The experimental results inconsistency makes it hard to evaluate if the machine learning method is effective.

Overall, the contribution of the prototype and the self-collected dataset is a bit disconnected from the machine learning perspective. I’d suggest the authors to design the experiments differently, to either showcase the effectiveness of the dataset, or the effectiveness of the machine learning approach.
