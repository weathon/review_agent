## Abstract
In high-stakes domains, decisions often hinge on jointly predicting multiple, correlated outcomes of mixed type (continuous, ordinal, categorical). Existing multivariate conformal methods impose restrictive geometric assumptions, perform poorly with mixed outcomes, or lack subgroup-conditional guarantees, leading to inflated prediction regions and uneven coverage. We propose \textsc{factor} (\emph{Fairness-Aligned Conformal Transport for Optimal Regions}), a framework for constructing compact and equitable prediction regions. \textsc{factor} learns an optimal-transport map in a latent space via normalizing flows with input-convex neural networks, providing a principled multivariate ranking without shape constraints. To enforce fairness, we synchronize latent-space ranks across subgroups, yielding distribution-free marginal coverage and a finite-sample $O(1/N)$ bound on subgroup calibration error. A sliding-window cutoff procedure then minimizes prediction region volume while preserving validity. Empirically, on synthetic and six real-world benchmarks, \textsc{factor} consistently achieves target coverage with reduced region volume and subgroup disparities (measured by KS distance) relative to state-of-the-art baselines under competitive runtime. The method also produces interpretable visualizations and conditional summaries, making \textsc{factor} a practical tool for uncertainty quantification in multivariate, mixed-outcome settings.

### Summary
The paper introduces FACTOR, a framework for constructing fair, compact, and distribution-free conformal prediction regions for multivariate mixed-type outcomes. It combines optimal transport (OT), normalizing flows, and fairness synchronization to ensure both marginal and subgroup-conditional coverage guarantees and was compared against several baselines. The method provides finite-sample fairness bounds, $ O(1/N) $, efficient region construction, and interpretable visualization capabilities.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel framework that combines CP, OT, and fairness calibration in an elegant manner.
- FACTOR is presented with good theoretical rigor, with proofs, and has a solid mathematical foundation
- FACTOR is evaluated on both synthetic and (6) real-world datasets, resulting in a good empirical evaluation.
- FACTOR achieves a good balance of conformal efficiency (prediction region size) while also achieving the subgroup coverage parity. All without any additional costs to time elapsed.
- The paper was well presented and was clear when presenting the methodology

### Weaknesses
- It would be nice to see results with higher-dimensional outcomes, especially for a scalability analysis. The experiments are limited to low-dimensional outcomes. Would higher dimensions be feasible, or would we need low-rank approximations?
- While it is mentioned that FACTOR can be extended to other fairness definitions, it would be nice to see some results for a metric other than demographic parity.

### Questions
See weaknesses

- Are the interpretable visualizations referring to Figures 1 and 2? If so, could you justify how a practitioner would use these to ease analysis more so than any other plot?
- How does your method scale with calibration size? Are there areas where parallelism can be applied?


- (Clarification) In Lemma 1, is $\hat{v}{(1)}$ supposed to be $0$, or is there an implicit definition of $\hat{v}{(0)} = 0$?
The “Why it works” section suggests that $\hat{v}{(1)} = 0$ when it refers to the one-sided rule as corresponding to the interval $[\hat{v}{(1)}, \hat{v}_{(\hat{k})}]$.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach to create compact and equitable prediction regions in multivariate response settings. They propose learning the optimal-transport map in a latent space via normalizing flows with input convex neural networks, transforming the multivariate problem into a univariate one that can be used to construct the conformal region. They also propose a sliding window trick to get compact prediction regions. Finally, they propose synchronizing the latent-space ranks of specific subgroups to achieve a finite-sample coverage bound for each subgroup, enabling equitable prediction regions. They perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets (all with a bivariate outcome), which showcase promising results, certainly regarding the subgroup guarantees.

### Strengths
- The approach to get an equitable set is very clean, well-motivated, and demonstrated to work on real-world data.
- The approach is straightforward and presented well.

### Weaknesses
- For me, it is not so clear what the research deltas are compared with the works of Thurin et al. (2025) and Klein et al. (2025). It seems that both these works introduce a similar procedure as you, besides the sub-group guarantee and the volume optimality, if so, I think this should be more clearly stated in the methodology section.
- The papers claim to present an approach for mixed multivariate responses. However, only bivariate responses are tested, and it seems that only continuous responses are evaluated.
- One thing I notice is that in the discussion and also in the related work, you skip over the high-density approaches, which, I intuitively find, provide very good prediction regions. A more elaborate discussion could improve the work. Examples of such high-density works are:

### Questions
- In Fig. 1. Your example regions are quite similar for HDR, L-CP, and FACTOR; however, the KS distance is quite different. Can you elaborate on that?
- What is the reason for in the synthetic datasets that the efficiency is best out of all approaches and for the real world experiments is worst (disregarding MCP)?
- So by enforcing the fairness, you get a suboptimal solution, in terms of transport map, what is the effect on efficiency after the calibration procedure?
- Regarding Eq. 5, it is not clear to me what r_{\alpha, 1} and r_{\alpha, 2} represent here; you should explain it a bit more clearly, in my opinion.
- Could you maybe explain a bit more thoroughly why that optimization in the rank space results in the shortest region in the outcome space?
- Regarding the actual creation of the prediction region,  do we need to do a grid search over the response domain to approximate the prediction region?

### Summary
The paper targets an important problem, about mixed type multi-dimensional outcome with applied examples.

The proposed method FACTOR hinges on transforming the conditional distribution of Y given X (and S) into Uniform reference distributions via normalizing flow (NF). The NF is learned to optimize the KL distance of the transformed distribution to the reference, and this optimaization problem is approximately solved using solutions in a space that has simpler function forms. 

Some nice features of FACTOR includes that it synchronizes latent-space ranks across subgroups, to achieve distribution-free group-wise coverage.  Empirical studies on synthetic and six real-world datasets show that FACTOR can achieve target coverage with smaller prediction regions than the competitors presented. 

However, the current draft missed noticing and comparing to a couple of relevant alternative methods for multi-target CP.

I have major concern about the presentation. While the overall idea and theory are very interesting, the writing makes it difficult and frustrating to follow and check the details. This should be fixable though!

### Strengths
The idea of transforming y|x to a standard distribution is a powerful backbone of this work.
The way of learning that transformation by posing this as an optimization problem (1) and approximating the solution (3, 4, Thm 2) seems very neat. 

It’s great to see that the algorithm, which involves multiple nontrivial steps, has been carefully designed and implemented.

### Weaknesses
Some literatures not discussed in "Related work" that also allow flexible shape multi-dimensional CP are as follows. These works could also serve as useful benchmarks for comparison with the proposed FACTOR method in empirical studies.
PCP by Wang et al (Probabilistic conformal prediction using conditional random samples) AISTATS, 2023.
CONTRA by Fang et al (Conformal Prediction Region via Normalizing Flow Transformation) ICLR, 2025.

Presentation-wise, there were often missing transitions between the bullet-point style paragraphs, and there are quite a lot of ambiguous statements. The draft would benefit from a more careful round of proofreading. E.g., the authors could inspect it as if they were first-time readers.

Quote Remark 3"Because prediction regions in outcome space are inverse
images of these intervals under a monotone transport, shorter intervals lead directly to smaller,
more efficient prediction regions." I don't agree with this statement. As a simple counter example, v=u^3 is a monotone mapping, but shorter intervals in u, does not necessarily lead to shorter invervals in v. You can see that intervcal of size 0.5 in u can lead to intervals of size anywhere from 1/8 to 7/8 in v. It's the magnitude of the change of rate (slope) of the mapping at different u that counts, not just that the slope is always positive (monotonely increasing).
Because of this disagreement, I have some doubt on the cutoff optimization strategy in section 2.3. (Maybe I misunderstood something here, please let me know.)


Quote Remark 1 "In the univariate case, u∗(·) reduces to the CDF F(·), so the OT-based rank is a direct
multivariate generalization of quantiles." Here, by u^*(.) do you mean a function y while fixing X and S? And what is "the cdf F"? The meaning of this sentence is unclear. In general, when a function has multiple input/argument, please state more clearly which argument is a variable and what others you are fixing/conditioning upon when you call it a function. This issue occurs at least in one other place, where function u(.) needs to be projected into a space of v(.) functions in sec 2.2. 

Also, read Theorem 2 again. It's not tight and clear mathematically. Basic setups/context and assumptions need to be stated INSIDE the Theorem.
Actually, for the space G defined in L165, is it for a fixed X or what? The general idea and theory sound very cool but the presentation makes it quite frustrating when I tried to undersatnd the details.

### Questions
L128 What is a "protected subgroup label"? (I can guess what it means after reading a few more pages, but I believe this should be explained explicitly upfront. Perhaps present an applied example in the beginning.) 

If some dimension of Y is nominal categorical, that is, the ordering of the category is meaningless, is it still proper to use your framework of \mathcal{Y} \subset R^p?

There seems to be great similarity between the idea of FACTOR and CONTRA. Note that FACTOR seeks a transformation (ended up using normalizing flow) of y|x into random vector that follows the Uniform distribution on a p-dimensional ball; CONTRA learns a normalizing flow that transforms y|x into a p-dimensional standard normal random vector. Both methods then define the non-conformity score as distance of transformed variable to the origin and obtained empirical quantile to construct conformal regions for new data points.
I think a key difference is that in learning the NF, FACTOR tried to minimize the KL divergence between transformed and reference distributions, while CONTRA tried to minimize negative log likelihood. Both ideas make sense, and it would be interesting to see how they compare in empirical studies of various kinds.

### Summary
The paper introduces FACTOR (Fairness-Aligned Conformal Transport for Optimal Regions), a novel framework for constructing fair prediction regions for multivariate, mixed-type (continuous/discrete) outcomes. FACTOR defines a principled multivariate ranking by learning an optimal transport map, approximated by a normalizing flow with input-convex neural networks. This map pushes complex, mixed-type outcomes into a simple uniform latent space, and the norm of the transported point serves as a scalar conformity score, avoiding restrictive geometric assumptions. To ensure equity, FACTOR introduces a functional synchronization step that post-processes the OT-based scores to align their distributions across protected subgroups. This provides a formal, finite-sample O(1/N) bound on the subgroup calibration error, directly addressing a major limitation of many existing conformal methods. The framework includes a sliding-window cutoff optimization procedure that searches for the shortest interval in the rank space to achieve the desired coverage. This technique is shown to produce smaller prediction regions than standard one-sided quantile methods, especially in the presence of finite-sample noise or distributional irregularities.

### Strengths
The proposed method combines optimal transport for multivariate ranking, ICNN-based normalizing flows for implementation, a post-hoc synchronization step for fairness, and a sliding-window optimization for efficiency. This framework appears to be novel and well-motivated. The OT formulation provides a sound theoretical basis for a multivariate rank. In particular, a standout contribution is the finite-sample O(1/N_s) bound on subgroup calibration error (Theorem 3). This is a significant step beyond the marginal or asymptotic guarantees offered by most conformal methods and provides a strong theoretical underpinning for the fairness claims.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is about the complexity in implementing the proposed method. The method relies on several advanced components (ICNNs, normalizing flows, OT maps). Each component involves a complicated task, a break down in any of these components may lead to unsatisfactory results. For example, the quality of the OT map, and therefore the efficiency of the prediction regions, depends on the underlying normalizing flow model. The paper acknowledges this but does not systematically analyze robustness to model misspecification. Poorly trained flows could lead to distorted ranks and inefficient regions, even if formal coverage is maintained. More theoretical analysis or numerical experiments are needed to analyze the robustness of the method.

### Questions
How sensitive is the efficiency of FACTOR's prediction regions to the quality of the learned OT map? For example, if the normalizing flow is poorly trained, how does this affect the region volume compared to baselines?

The experiments are all conducted with p=2. How does the performance (training stability, runtime, region size) of FACTOR change as the dimension of the outcome space p increases?
