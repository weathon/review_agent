# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 6, 2, 4, 4

## Abstract
We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label and a binary background (or environment) . We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where one source subpopulation, defined by a combination of label and background variables, is completely missing. This structured missingness makes classical domain adaptation invalid. The authors derive target-domain prediction formulas based on a conditional invariance assumption and propose a KL-divergence-based distribution matching estimator to recover unobserved subgroup proportions. They provide theoretical guarantees and validate the method on synthetic and real datasets. Results show consistent improvements over naïve benchmarks that ignore the unobserved subpopulation

### Strengths
1. The paper defines a previously unstudied but realistic UDA scenario: structured subpopulation absence in the source. This bridges gaps between label shift, open-set label shift, and missing-data frameworks.

2. The KL-based distribution matching avoids high-dimensional density estimation by relying only on classification probabilities, which is computationally elegant. Algorithm 1 is practical and well structured.

3. The paper situates itself well within OOD generalization, spurious correlation, and open-set adaptation literature.

### Weaknesses
1. Only Waterbirds is shown in the main text; synthetic and other results are relegated to the appendix. The method’s robustness across diverse settings (e.g., CelebA or tabular data) remains unclear.

2. The experiments seem rely on a handcrafted partition (missing (Y=1, A=1)) rather than a naturally occurring absence.

3. The key conditional invariance assumption is strong: it requires identical conditional distributions across domains. The authors provide examples but no empirical test or sensitivity analysis. In practice, small violations could substantially bias the estimator.

### Questions
1. How robust is the method if the conditional invariance assumption is slightly violated?

2. Can this framework extend to multi-class or continuous background variables A?

3. Can this be framed as a causal identification problem under missing mechanisms?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new setting for domain adaptation, in which they assume the data is rare to obtain even in the source domain, and thus some cases exist in the target domain but not exist in the source domain.

### Strengths
This paper is easy to read. Table 1 and Figure 1 are helpful in understanding the motivation.

### Weaknesses
It is hard to understand the application of this setting, so I can't support the idea in this paper. In this paper, they first define Y ∈ {0, 1} as the binary label observed in the source domain, and then define A ∈ {0, 1} as a binary background or environment variable. But why should Y and A be binary? In the reviewer's sense, in every application, many categories exist in the distribution of Y, as well as the shared information A across both domains. It can be observed in Figure 2 that Y is defined as "Blond hair" and "Black Hair" in this setting, but hairs with other colors should also be considered. Similar conflicts with different variables, like Water/Land/Sky and Water/Land/Sky bird.

With the initial setting being hard to assess, it is hard to consider the contribution of this paper further.

### Questions
Please clarify the weakness above.

### Summary
The paper studies a new and fine-grained unsupervised domain adaptation problem where a structured label–background subpopulation is missing in the source domain. Based on the assumption of identical conditional distributions across the two domains, the authors propose a theoretical framework to estimate subpopulation proportions in the target domain, with theoretical guarantees and error bounds provided. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and outperforms baselines that ignore structured missingness.

### Strengths
The subpopulation shift problem in unsupervised domain adaptation is common in realistic data collection scenarios, making it both significant and practical to study. This paper considers an extreme case where an entire label–background subpopulation is missing from the source domain.

The proposed subpopulation estimation method is solid, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees and error bounds. It provides a comprehensive solution to the specific subpopulation-missing problem.

The experimental design aligns well with the problem setting, and empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The problem setting lacks sufficient novelty. Subpopulation shift has been studied previously [1,2,3,4,5], and it is not convincing to claim novelty merely by considering an extreme case of the open-set subpopulation problem—where one subpopulation is entirely missing from the source domain but may exist in the target domain—and presenting it as a new problem setting.

The proposed method relies on the assumption that the conditional distribution is identical across the two domains, which can be easily satisfied under simplified conditions. However, this assumption oversimplifies real-world domain adaptation scenarios, where both severe domain shifts and label shifts often exist, making it difficult to ensure an invariant and target-discriminative conditional distribution.

To align with this restricted problem setting, the experiments are also limited in practicality and scope. Although the paper discusses historical and facial datasets to motivate the problem, only one real-world dataset (Waterbirds) is actually used. Moreover, the selected baseline adaptation methods are not representative, overlooking both prior subpopulation shift approaches and several mainstream adaptation methods such as distribution matching and self-training.

### Questions
The paper provides a solid solution to the label–background subpopulation missingness problem in unsupervised domain adaptation. However, the main concern lies in the practicality of the setting and experiments, which limits the overall scope and applicability of the work.

### Summary
The paper provides a theoretical framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) that specifically accounts for the scenario where an entire subpopulation defined by the binary background A is unobservable in the source domain.

### Strengths
1. Presents a robust theoretical framework with strong theoretical guarantees and generalization bounds. I have not verified the correctness in depth.

### Weaknesses
1. It is a niche problem under unsupervised domain adaptation limiting its scope and usefulness. This is the major drawback. 
2. Inadequate experimental results - just 1 page are insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of this model. 
3. The reviewer is only concerned about the usefulness of the proposed approach.
