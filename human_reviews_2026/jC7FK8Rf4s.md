## Abstract
Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining different data modalities. However, modalities observed in the source environment may differ from the modalities observed in the target environment due to multiple factors, including cost, hardware failure, or the perceived *informativeness* of a given modality. This change in missingness patterns between the source and target environment has not been carefully studied. Naïve estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in the target environment. We formalize the problem of missingness, demonstrate its ubiquity, and show that the subsequent distribution shift induces bias when the missingness process is not explicitly accounted for. To address this issue, we introduce $\text{ICYM}^2\text{I}$ (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.

### Summary
This paper addresses missingness-induced distribution shifts in multimodal learning, a largely overlooked issue where source and target environments differ in observed modalities. It notes that naive estimation without accounting for this shift biases modality informativeness and predictive utility estimates. To solve this, it proposes the $ICYM^2I$ framework, which uses inverse probability weighting correction under the MAR assumption to evaluate performance and information gain under missingness. The framework is validated on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets to demonstrate its utility.

### Strengths
1. Framing missingness in multimodal learning as an intrinsic distribution shift between source and target environments is novel, as well as formalizing its mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, and MNAR) and showing unaddressed shift biases modality informativeness and predictive utility estimates.
2. This paper proposes a double inverse probability weighting (IPW) framework under the realistic MAR assumption to correct both training and evaluation, enabling unbiased assessment of predictive performance and information gain under missingness.
3. The proposed method integrates IPW into Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to adjust for $\Omega_{obs} \mapsto \Omega$ shift, designing an autodifferentiable algorithm with modified Sinkhorn-Knopp to handle high-dimensional data for unbiased information decomposition 
4. This paper applies the framework to structural heart disease detection, revealing chest radiographs have minimal independent informativeness, bridging methodological advances with real-world healthcare.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper relies heavily on the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, but real-world multimodal scenarios often involve Missing Not At Random (MNAR). It provides no solutions for MNAR and only briefly mentions its limitations, lacking sensitivity analysis for MAR violations. The authors could add experiments on MNAR with plausible assumptions (e.g., simulating unobserved covariates) or explore semi-parametric methods to relax MAR.
2. The PID in $ICYM^2I$ focuses on two modalities, but real multimodal tasks involve more, i.e., 3+ modalities. This paper only mentions a "one-vs-all" approach without detailed implementation or validation, leaving scalability unclear. 
3. Experiments simulate MAR using existing modalities (e.g., X1 predicts X2 missing) but ignore real drivers of missingness. For example, in healthcare, CXR missingness may relate to patient insurance status, which is unrelated to existing modalities. 
4. The SHD case study uses data from a single academic hospital system, with no validation on external multi-center datasets. This limits the clinical generalization of conclusions.

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework to correct for bias in multimodal learning arising from missing modalities. The authors argue that the informativeness and predictive value of a modality are often misestimated when the missingness process differs between the source and target environments, a realistic but underexplored issue. ICYM2I leverages IPW to adjust both model training and evaluation under the MAR assumption. The method also extends to information-theoretic decomposition, allowing unbiased estimation of modality informativeness through a corrected version of PID. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that ignoring missingness can substantially bias conclusions about modality utility, while ICYM2I provides more accurate informativeness estimates.

### Strengths
The paper is conceptually strong and addresses a highly relevant but largely overlooked problem in multimodal learning: the impact of missing modalities on the estimation of informativeness and performance. It offers a clear and rigorous formalization of missingness as a type of distribution shift, which is an important contribution to the field. The proposed use of inverse probability weighting is theoretically grounded in classical missing-data and statistical literature, and its adaptation to multimodal settings is elegant. The integration with information-theoretic concepts, particularly the extension of PID under missingness, is well-motivated and contributes to a deeper understanding of modality interactions. Overall, the paper is well-written, the motivation is convincing, and the theoretical framing is solid and potentially impactful.

### Weaknesses
Despite its strong conceptual foundation, the paper’s methodological presentation is somewhat difficult to follow. Understanding the full framework requires frequent reference to the appendix, which makes it challenging to reconstruct the complete algorithmic pipeline from the main text. In particular, Step 2 and Step 10 of Algorithm 1, which concern the estimation of the missingness mechanism $p_{\Omega_\phi}(m|C)$ and its integration into the weighting scheme, are crucial for comprehension and should be explicitly detailed in the main body. It also remains unclear how exactly this missingness model is parameterized or estimated in practice. Moreover, the objective of minimizing $I(Y; (X_1, X_2))$ appears counterintuitive and should be clarified, as mutual information is typically maximized in multimodal fusion. From an empirical perspective, while the synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are carefully designed and demonstrate the motivation, the work lacks convincing real-world evidence that the proposed correction improves downstream predictive performance. Correcting modality informativeness estimates is valuable, but readers are left wondering whether a practitioner facing genuinely missing modalities would actually see performance gains by applying ICYM2I. Finally, the framework’s dependence on a particular parameterization $q_\theta = \exp(f_1 f_2)$ is restrictive; demonstrating that the approach generalizes across different fusion architectures would strengthen the empirical case and enhance credibility.
Lastly, a weakness regarding the submission is that the code has not been shared, either in the supplementary material or via an anonymized GitHub repository, which limits reproducibility and verification of the claims. Lastly, a weakness regarding the submission is that the code has not been shared, either in the supplementary material or via an anonymized GitHub repository, which limits how much reviewers can verify and fully assess the implementation and results.

### Questions
Could you elaborate on how  $p_{\Omega_\phi}(m|C)$  is actually modeled and estimated? How sensitive is performance to misspecification of this model?


Have you considered cases with unpaired modalities, where instances across modalities are not aligned? Could you comment how the method could be extended to such cases? 



Would the method still hold for other forms of fusion beyond $q_\theta = \exp(f_1 f_2)$ , e.g. attention-based models especially when large in parameter number?


Could one imagine a generative formulation where C and Y are governed by a single latent variable, and would this affect how modality informativeness is estimated?

### Summary
The paper studies an issue in multimodal learning: when training/evaluating only on samples where all modalities are present, we bias both performance estimates and conclusions about each modality’s "informativeness". 

The authors formalize missingness as a distribution shift and propose $\text{ICYM}^2\text{I}$, a double inverse-probability weighting (IPW) correction—apply IPW at training time and again at evaluation time—to recover estimates with respect to the target (fully observed) population. 

They further adapt Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to high-dimensional settings to decompose a modality’s contribution into unique, shared, and complementary/synergistic information, and show that naive PID computed on complete-case data can be substantially biased.

### Strengths
- **Methodologically sound correction**. Leveraging IPW for both training and evaluation addresses two common sources of bias.
- **Information-theoretic perspective**. Connecting PID to missingness is insightful; prior PID work [1] did not consider selection bias from partial observation.
- **Thorough experiments**. The synthetic/XOR table shows great insights about how complete-case analysis can invert conclusions (even negative "shared" due to bias) and how correction aligns with oracle; this pattern recurs in UR-FUNNY and Hateful Memes.

### Weaknesses
- **Assumption strength and scope**. The core guarantee hinges on MAR + positivity. I wonder whether this holds true in most multimodal systems. For instance, missingness can be MNAR, which violates the MAR assumption. The paper simulates MNAR in the appendix but does not probe MNAR in the clinical study. I suggest authors add sensitivity analyses on real-world data.
- **Breadth of baselines**. Empirically, the paper compares observed vs. corrected vs. oracle. It would help to include strong missing-modality baselines (e.g., SMIL [2], modality-incomplete prompt/adapters [3]) to situate ICYM2I among robustness methods; also relate to missingness-shift DA.
