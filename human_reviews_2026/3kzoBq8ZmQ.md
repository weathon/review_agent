## Abstract
Extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly when the target concepts are organized within complex hierarchical ontologies. We present HyperRAG, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and hierarchical reranking using hyperbolic embeddings. Our approach is designed to improve entity linking and retrieval in settings where the label space exhibits rich hierarchical relationships. In addition, we introduce a hierarchy-aware evaluation framework that leverages ontology structure to provide a more nuanced assessment of model performance, moving beyond conventional exact-match metrics. Through comprehensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including a newly curated and challenging set of clinical notes for phenotype extraction in precision medicine, we demonstrate that HyperRAG substantially improves ranking accuracy and recall, especially for implicit or nuanced entity mentions. While our primary application is in the biomedical domain, the proposed framework is broadly applicable and generalizable to hierarchical entity linking and retrieval tasks in other domains. All code, models, and datasets are released to support reproducibility.

### Summary
Hyper-RAG introduces an innovative hypergraph-based knowledge representation to address the high-order association loss in traditional RAG frameworks. The design logically separates entity-level and association-level retrieval (vertices vs. hyperedges), improving semantic relevance and reasoning precision. However, the study lacks several key elements for rigor and reproducibility, including ablation studies on critical components, detailed experimental settings, and statistical significance tests. Moreover, the manuscript does not provide clarity on scalability or potential failure cases.

### Strengths
1.Identifies a clear limitation of graph-based RAG in the loss of high-order associations and proposes a targeted hypergraph-based solution.
2.Designs a dual-retrieval mechanism that separately retrieves entity keywords as vertices and association keywords as hyperedges, incorporating cross-diffusion to enhance retrieval coherence.

### Weaknesses
1.The core novelty of HyperRAG, namely the integration of hyperbolic embeddings into RAG for hierarchical entity linking, is not sufficiently distinguished from prior work. The paper does not clearly articulate how HyperRAG advances this line of research beyond an incremental application to biomedical ontologies.

2.The hyperbolic RAG model underperforms Euclidean RAG on both ID-68 and CHU-50 datasets (Figure 4), yet the paper does not provide a convincing analysis of why this critical limitation occurs. Without addressing this fundamental performance gap, the rationale for using hyperbolic embeddings in the RAG pipeline remains weak.

3.The hybrid reranking strategy relies on a fixed γ=0.5 (Equation 1), but the ablation study (Appendix C) shows marginal performance differences across γ values (e.g., γ=0.5 vs. γ=0.7). The paper does not justify why γ=0.5 is optimal.

4.The CHU-50 dataset, described as "manually generated synthetical clinical notes," lacks sufficient validation details. The paper only reports that 30% of annotations are implicit but provides no information on inter-annotator agreement (e.g., Cohen’s kappa) for these implicit labels, raising concerns about annotation reliability.

5.The paper fails to conduct a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods specifically designed for hierarchical entity linking or phenotype extraction. 

6.The paper claims HyperRAG is "broadly applicable to other domains," but no cross-domain experiments are provided. The only cross-ontology test uses SNOMED (a biomedical ontology).

### Summary
The paper is concerned with the problem of entity linking, where a span in a textual passage needs to be linked to an entry in a knowledge base. In particular, the knowledge base is assumed to have a hierarchical structure where concepts are arranged in a tree-like structure. Motivated by prior work demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperbolic embeddings at embedding hierarchical data, the authors present results comparing the use of Euclidean and different variations incorporating hyperbolic embeddings for the entity linking task. Results are focused on the clinical domain.

### Strengths
1. The paper is very well-written and concise. The structure and flow of the text make it a pleasure to read.
2. The challenge of entity linking over hierarchies is a timely one, and it is well-motivated and mostly well-positioned with respect to prior work on representation learning over hierarchies.
3. The experiments examine different metrics that shed light on the performance of the methods, comprising embedding faithfulness, recall, miss rate, and ranking metrics.

### Weaknesses
1. The methodological novelty of the paper seems limited. The method is an instance of dense retrievers for entity linking, which to the best of my knowledge go back to Wu et al. (2020) and since then followed by several works; but replacing the common Euclidean embedding assumption by a hyperbolic one (which is another well-studied area of research). In this sense, the paper presents a comparison of embedding spaces for entity linking.
2. The main claim is that HyperRAG shows "substantial improvements, particularly in scenarios with implicit entity mentions." is problematic for several reasons:
   - Fig. 4 shows that the Euclidean approach is in fact better than Hyperbolic, contradicting the motivations given in the introduction and the hyperbolic consistency results in sec. 6.1.
   - Table 1 also shows very similar results between the Euclidean-only approach and the Hybrid reranking approach. Fig 7 in fact shows that the higher the value of $\gamma$, i.e. a higher weight on Euclidean rather than hyperbolic scores, is in fact better (and why the authors instead chose $\gamma$ = 0.5 -see L333-is not clear).
   - The small differences do not really point to "substantial improvements", and in fact when so close they should be subject to a suitable statistical test, especially when datasets are small.
   - I would lean towards reading this paper as a negative results paper, where a simple Euclidean space with no re-ranking proves to be better than other more complex pipelines. However, this perspective is not considered nor discussed in the paper.
3. The motivation for alternative metrics is good, but the resulting metrics proposed by the authors where metrics are weighted by distances in the ontology are not ideal: they introduce parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which seem to be domain-dependent (according to the appendix, they are chosen by clinicians, but how this is exactly done is not clear). This leaves the question of whether one could tune $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to favor one method over another.
4. The CHU50 dataset seems very small, in which case an appropriate description of how the data is split for training/validation/test is warranted. There is no mention about this in the paper, but in such cases other protocols might be more appropriate, like average k-fold cross-validation performance. An inspection of the supplementary data shows that the CHU50 dataset (`sentences_chu50_spans.csv`) contains 2,487 instances, out of which 149 instances only are labeled as containing spans linked to the HPO. Does this mean that the reported metrics are averaged over 149 instances?
5. The question of how the results would generalize to other domains is not answered.

### Questions
1. Can you please elaborate or argue why your method is not simply a modification of well-known dense retrievers where entity embeddings are trained on a hyperbolic space?
2. Do you agree with the perspective that your results are in fact a negative results that favors a simple Euclidean-based retrieval approach?
3. Is there a systematic approach towards choosing $\alpha$ and $\beta$? How can we ensure that the chosen values are effective at measuring the performance of a method?
4. Can you please clarify the issues about the CHU50 dataset highlighted in W4?
5. You mention that the data is fully anonymized, yet there are names and birth dates present in them, as provided in the supplementary material. Can you please confirm whether these are the result of the anonymization process?

### Summary
This paper presents HyperRAG, a pipeline for linking text entities to hierarchical ontologies. The method first uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for initial candidate retrieval. The core contribution is a subsequent hierarchical reranking step that leverages hyperbolic embeddings to refine this list based on the ontology's structure.

The authors also introduce a hierarchy-aware evaluation framework that offers a more nuanced assessment than traditional exact-match methods. Experiments show that a hybrid reranking strategy, which combines semantic and hierarchical signals, outperforms existing baselines, particularly on a new, challenging dataset with implicit entity mentions. All code and data are made publicly available to support reproducibility.

### Strengths
1. The paper tackles the important challenge of linking entities to hierarchical ontologies, with a valuable focus on the difficult case of implicit mentions, which is a key limitation in prior work.

2. The core contribution is the well-designed HyperRAG workflow, which creatively combines LLMs, RAG, and a novel hierarchical reranking step. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchy-aware evaluation framework is a good contribution, offering a more comprehensive assessment for such tasks.

3. The approach is validated and shows a clear advantage over strong baselines on a challenging new dataset. The public release of all code, models, and data is a major strength that ensures reproducibility and benefits the community.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed HyperRAG pipeline introduces considerable complexity, including training a specialized hyperbolic model and adding a multi-stage reranking process. However, on the standard ID-68 benchmark, the final hybrid model's performance is only marginally better than the much simpler Euclidean RAG baseline. This raises a question about the practical value and cost-benefit trade-off of the proposed method.

2. The primary evidence supporting HyperRAG's advantage—its ability to handle implicit mentions—comes from the newly introduced CHU-50 dataset. This dataset is a significant weakness as it is small (only 50 notes) and, crucially, synthetically generated. Results from such a dataset are not a reliable proxy for performance on real-world clinical data.

3. The paper could be improved to meet the presentation standards in several ways. First, crucial technical details necessary to understand the methodology (e.g., model architectures, normalization strategies) are relegated to the appendix, making the main paper not self-contained and disrupting the review process. Second, the quality of the figures is extremely poor: they are low-resolution bitmaps instead of vector graphics, becoming blurry when zoomed in, and the font sizes are too small to be legible. Finally, the layout contains large, unprofessional white spaces.

### Questions
1. The core claims rely on a small, synthetic dataset. Could you provide evidence that the model's performance generalizes to real-world data and is not just an artifact of the synthetic generation process?

2. The complexity of HyperRAG yields only marginal gains on the standard ID-68 benchmark. Could you provide a cost-benefit analysis (e.g., computational overhead) to justify when this added complexity is worthwhile?

3. Could you justify the exclusion of essential details from the main text?

### Summary
The paper proposes HyperRAG, a framework that combines RAG and hyperbolic embeddings for entity linking in the biomedical domain. Specifically, HyperRAG consists of three steps: span identification that uses GPT3.5 for identifying mention spans, retrieval-augmented generation that retrieves top-K candidates, reranking that reranks retrieved candidates using a late-interaction model and hyperbolic-based scoring. Moreover, the paper also introduces a hierarchy-aware evaluation framework that rewards candidates semantically close in the ontology tree.

### Strengths
1. The paper explores hyperbolic embeddings in biomedical entity linking, and learns hyperbolic-based retriever and ranker models for ranking candidates. 
2. The paper also introduces an ontology-aware evaluation scheme that goes beyond standard exact-match metrics.
3. The code is provided for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper mentions “retrieval-augmented generation” in both the title and body, the proposed method does not include any actual generation component, only retrieval and reranking are involved. This discrepancy may mislead readers and creates a mismatch between the title and the scope of the method presented. 
2. The main contribution of the paper is the use of hyperbolic embeddings in retrieval and reranking models. However, the paper does not sufficiently justify why hyperbolic geometry is necessary or superior in this context, especially given that the Euclidean baseline performs competitively in several settings.
3. The writing of the paper requires significant improvement as there are lots of missing details regarding the proposed approach. For example:
(1) The paper lacks a clear introduction to hyperbolic embeddings, including how they are constructed and how distances are computed in hyperbolic space. This omission makes it difficult for readers unfamiliar with hyperbolic geometry to fully understand the proposed method and its underlying assumptions.
(2) In line 160, the paper mentions “using either a base or HOP-fine-tuned hyperbolic model”, but it is unclear what the “base” model refers to, and which variant is actually used in the main experiments. 
4. The motivation and assumption behind the proposed hierarchy-aware evaluation framework is not entirely convincing. More elaboration is needed to justify its design choices and explain why it provides a more appropriate evaluation than standard metrics. 
5. The paper lacks empirical comparisons with recent biomedical entity linking baselines. 
6. The effectiveness of the proposed method is not thoroughly validated. In several cases, models using hyperbolic embeddings underperform compared to their Euclidean counterparts, yet the paper does not adequately explain the value or advantages of the proposed approach in such scenarios.

### Questions
1. The paper repeatedly mentions “retrieval-augmented generation” , yet the proposed method does not appear to have any actual generation component. Could the authors clarify whether any generation step is involved in the pipeline?
2. The central contribution of the paper is the use of hyperbolic embeddings in both retrieval and reranking. However, the performance gains over Euclidean baselines are inconsistent across settings, and in some cases, hyperbolic variants perform worse. Could the authors provide a more detailed justification for the necessity of hyperbolic geometry in this context?
