# A Function-Centric Graph Neural Network Approach for Predicting Electron Densities

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 4, 6

## Abstract
Electronic structure predictions are relevant for a wide range of applications, from drug discovery to materials science. Since the cost of purely quantum mechanical methods can be prohibitive, machine learning surrogates are used to predict the results of these calculations. This work introduces the Basis Overlap Architecture (BOA), an equivariant graph neural network architecture based on a novel message passing scheme that utilizes the overlap matrix of the basis functions used to represent the predicted ground state electron density. BOA is evaluated on QM9 and MD density datasets, surpassing the previous state of the art in predicting accurate electron densities. Excellent generalization to larger molecules of up to nearly 200 atoms is demonstrated using a model trained only on QM9 molecules of at most 9 heavy atoms.

### Summary
The authors build an equivariant architecture to perform electron density prediction using discretized bases, ultimately achieving significantly lower density prediction errors than previous work on small molecule datasets. The key innovation is in the message passing scheme used. The paper is generally well written, although there are some parts that I am still trying to understand (see the questions below).

### Strengths
The background work seems thorough (although I am personally only familiar with ELECTRA among them), and there is a clear improvement in electron density prediction.

### Weaknesses
The main body of the paper is methods-heavy and light on results. Certain components (eg, gated nonlinearities) are more well-known and could be shifted to the appendix. More explanatory figures/schematics could be very useful.

### Questions
Is there a benefit to predicting the electron density in this basis over learning the elements of the density matrix, similarly to what's done in Hamiltonian prediction models? Wouldn't this avoid going through the intermediate grid representation?

What is the complexity of the forward pass? For the second class of 'volumetric' prediction methods, I imagine the scalability to larger structures is quite poor. How much does use of these discrete methods improve on that?

The basis sets used are quite large, and if I remember correctly, QM9 uses HCONF elements. Do the authors expect that this could eventually scale well to heavy elements where the number of basis functions would become even larger?

What are the green circles in Fig. 1c? I looked at this subfigure for a while, since it seemed to be the 'visual explanation' that I was looking for, but am still confused.

How sensitive is the model to radial cutoffs? From what I've seen, MLIPs typically use smaller cutoffs (4-6 A) and Hamiltonian prediction models tend to use larger ones. Since the electron density is a more 'fundamental' quantity directly computed from Hamiltonian and density matrices, I'm wondering if electron density prediction models similarly benefit from larger cutoffs.

Can the authors discuss the error metric a bit more in detail? They use NMAE, which weights all grid points equally. How is the error usually distributed among grid points? Is it concentrated in areas where the electron density has a higher spatial variation? How does the distribution of the error vary between models?

### Summary
The paper introduces Basis Overlap Architecture, an equivariant GNN-based model to predict ground-state electron densities. The direct density prediction aims to replace the computationally expensive KD-DFT calculations. The authors develop an innovative message scheme that casts internal network features as basis functions and computes an overlap matrix of interacting vertices to compute messages. Instead of a linear expansion, the model casts the density as a quadratic expansion of the learned basis functions. Attention is calculated based on the overlap matrix and Coulomb matrix for additional physical inductive bias. BOA shows strong performance on density prediction on the QM9 and MD datasets.

### Strengths
1. The internal density representation and the model architecture are well motivated, have the proper inductive bias. The problem of fast density generation is important for molecule discovery and characterization
2. Representing internuclear regions without virtual nodes is a novel innovation

### Weaknesses
1.  "In contrast to previous work, we however, do not expand the density or its square root directly as" Lin3 165-166.  citations here would be very helpful to situate the work 
2. Unclear presentation of Figure 1 and Figure 2. What is the MN block in Figure 2. The notation is difficult to follow. In general, the paper was difficult to follow and missing key information

### Questions
1. "Superscripts l and r denote left and right, respectively, for reasons that are clear from Equation 2" Line 155-156. It's not clear why the node features also have this directionality in the first term in Eq. 2. 
2. "BOA uses an initial guess based on the atom types of the nodes." Line 199- Initial guess of the coefficients for the atom features? 
3. How is the model trained? What loss function is used?

### Summary
This paper introduces Basis Overlap Architecture (BOA), a new equivariant message passing neural network for predicting ground-state electron densities. Unlike prior approaches that expand the density linearly in atom-centered basis functions, BOA represents it as a quadratic expansion, inspired by the density matrix representation in Kohn–Sham DFT. The model leverages basis-function overlaps to define message passing between nodes, effectively incorporating both molecular geometry and basis information into the communication scheme.

### Strengths
**Novel and physically grounded formulation** : The idea of treating node features as functions represented in a basis and defining message passing through basis overlaps is elegant and well-motivated.
This approach embeds physical inductive bias (basis overlap, geometry dependence) directly into the architecture, rather than as post-hoc constraints.

**Comprehensive evaluation**: Experiments on two major datasets (QM9–VASP and MD–DFT) demonstrate strong and consistent improvements. The comparisons to strong recent baselines (SCDP, ELECTRA, GPWNO) are appropriate and show clear quantitative gains.

### Weaknesses
**Lack of quantitative validation on physical observables**: While the model demonstrates impressive accuracy in predicting electron densities, the paper does not quantify how this improvement translates into physically meaningful quantities — such as total energy, dipole moments, or electrostatic potentials. Without showing how the predicted densities affect DFT-derived properties or the self-consistent field (SCF) convergence, the connection between the proposed method and its stated motivation (accelerating or improving DFT) remains incomplete.

**Ablation and efficiency analysis**: The paper lacks quantitative ablations demonstrating which design choices (e.g., basis choice like def2-SVP, basis-overlap attention, quadratic expansion, learned radial corrections) most contribute to the observed performance. The large model reportedly requires ∼94 GB GPU memory, which raises questions about scalability and computational efficiency.

**Minor**
- Eq. (13) and others: Consider to change $(a,b) \in \mathcal E$ to $b \in \mathcal N(a)$ or equivalent so that $a$ remains a free index.

### Questions
1. **(Efficiency)** Have you evaluated the computational efficiency of BOA in terms of speed and memory usage compared to ELECTRA or other recent electron-density models?

2. **(Basis dependence)** How sensitive is BOA’s performance to the choice of basis set (e.g., def2-SVP vs. def2-QZVPPD)? Have you observed any notable differences in accuracy or stability?

3. **(Non–atom-centric extensions)** Could BOA be extended to incorporate non–atom-centered or floating basis functions, similar to ELECTRA’s floating orbitals, to further enhance flexibility?

4. **(Relation to KS-DFT coefficients)** Do the predicted coefficients correspond directly to the Kohn–Sham orbital coefficient matrix, or are they only related to the density-matrix blocks derived from it?

5. **(Scalability)** What is the computational scaling behavior of BOA with respect to the number of atoms or basis functions? Have you tested the model’s scalability on larger molecular systems?
