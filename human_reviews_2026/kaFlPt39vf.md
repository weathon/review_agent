## Abstract
Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning 2D images. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of large models and intensive training. 
In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterized quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models.
We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility.  
Our experiments demonstrate that---when trained on images of reduced resolution---QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that Quantum Machine Learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in high-level tasks in Computer Vision such as 3D representation learning.

### Summary
This work proposes the first hybrid quantum-classical model for novel-view synthesis of 2D images. It extends the Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) approach to the domain of 3D scene representation, leveraging the superposition and entanglement properties of parameterized quantum circuits to achieve a more compact model representation than conventional NeRF.

### Strengths
1. Through amplitude embedding, Q-NeRF can represent $2^n$ classical values using only $n$ qubits, achieving exponential parameter compression.

2. The method overcomes the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, particularly with the Dual Branch architecture, which significantly reduces state preparation complexity through branch-wise encoding.

3. Two architectures are provided, Full QNeRF and Dual Branch QNeRF, targeting maximal expressiveness and hardware compatibility, respectively.

4. Systematic experiments are conducted on the Blender and LLFF datasets, covering noise-free simulations, noisy environments, and scalability analyses. The experimental design is rigorous, including five repetitions with different random seeds to ensure the reliability of results.

### Weaknesses
1. Experiments are conducted only on downsampled images (100×100 pixels for the Blender dataset and 63×47 pixels for the LLFF dataset). It is unclear whether the method can be extended to high-quality, high-resolution scenes.  
2. It remains uncertain whether existing approximate amplitude encoding schemes can truly overcome exponential complexity while maintaining performance. For higher-resolution scenes, such as 512×512 pixels, how many qubits would be required to achieve competitive results?  
3. More advanced NeRF variants, such as Mip-NeRF and Instant-NGP, have already significantly outperformed the original NeRF in many aspects. Comparing only with the original version may not accurately reflect the competitiveness of Q-NeRF in the current technological landscape.  
4. It is unclear whether the Q-NeRF approach can be extended to other 3D vision tasks. Tasks such as 3D reconstruction, scene editing, and dynamic scene modeling may also potentially benefit from quantum representations.

### Summary
The paper proposes QNeRF, a hybrid quantum–classical replacement of the NeRF MLP, with two variants (Full and Dual-Branch). Amplitude embeddings, local-Z readouts with parity averaging, and a learnable “de-concentration” scaling are used to mitigate trainability issues. On downscaled Blender/LLFF scenes, Full QNeRF achieves higher PSNR than a classical baseline with <50% parameters; Dual-Branch matches baseline PSNR while being more noise-tolerant under IBM FakeKyiv/FakeTorino noise.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper introduces QNeRF, a NeRF variant where the MLP is replaced by parameterized quantum circuits (PQC). Beyond the straightforward hybridization, the authors propose a Dual-Branch quantum embedding that separately encodes position and viewing direction before composition, explicitly targeting NISQ constraints (shallower circuits, reduced state-preparation burden). This is a creative combination of implicit neural representations and quantum feature maps that broadens how NeRF-like volumetric rendering can be parameterized.

Quality: On two datasets, QNeRF attains comparable or better PSNR than a classical NeRF baseline with fewer than half the learnable parameters, indicating a favorable accuracy–parameter trade-off. The results also show that the Dual-Branch variant preserves performance while aligning the circuit design with realistic hardware limits, which supports the claim of hardware-aware modeling.
Clarity: The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The problem setup, the transition from classical MLPs to PQC blocks, and the end-to-end rendering pipeline are explained in a way that makes the contribution reproducible. Definitions and symbols are used consistently, and the motivation for the Dual-Branch construction is articulated with sufficient intuition.

Significance: QNeRF offers a new template for marrying NeRF-style continuous scene representations with quantum embeddings, potentially enabling future lines of work on quantum-accelerated volume rendering, quantum feature maps for 3D geometry, and hardware-aligned implicit modeling.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited practicality of the model. When the number of qubits is $n$, the overall complexity of QNeRF remains $2^n$, e.g., in the MLP replacement and state preparation. Even if the PQC step has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$, the end-to-end complexity is still $2^n$. Moreover, quantum computation typically requires many measurement shots and has inefficient backpropagation, so the wall-clock time of running QNeRF on a quantum computer may be much higher than classically simulating QNeRF.

   Suggestion: Optimize the model architecture so that the motivation for introducing quantum computation is more compelling. Alternatively, compute the end-to-end resource consumption of QNeRF and compare it against the time for classical simulation; specify the conditions under which QNeRF achieves quantum advantage, and then discuss the practical value of QNeRF.

2. Insufficient numerical experiments. Important dimensions are missing, such as how performance scales with the number of qubits, how results depend on the number of shots, and how noise affects inference/training.

   Suggestion: Add the above missing numerical studies to substantiate the claims.

### Questions
1. Scaling with qubit count and depth. How does QNeRF’s performance change with the number of qubits (n)? Please provide curves such as (n) vs. PSNR and layer depth vs. PSNR, and discuss the observed trends.
2. Conditions for practical quantum advantage. Under what parameter regimes—qubit count ($n$), layer depth ($l$), number of shots, noise strength, etc.—can QNeRF achieve practical quantum advantage? Please specify the conditions and provide supporting evidence or estimates.
3. Dual-branch claim on amplitude reduction. The paper states that, compared to the Full QNeRF approach, the dual-branch strategy reduces the number of amplitudes exponentially. However, the counts between the two schemes appear to have a quadratic relationship rather than an exponential one. Please clarify this claim and reconcile the discrepancy.
4. Noise resilience evaluation (Section 5.1). Section 5.1 evaluates state fidelity vs. layer depth $l$ only. To substantiate the noise-resilience claim, please add experiments that vary noise strength (e.g., readout/dephasing/coherent error rates) and measure their impact on inference/training performance (e.g., PSNR, gradients, convergence behavior).

### Summary
This paper proposes two novel models based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) designed for learning 3D models, a task analogous to classical Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The authors present a comprehensive performance comparison against classical methods, analyzing metrics like parameter count, gate count, and output fidelity (PSNR). Through numerical simulations, the paper demonstrates a significant performance advantage over classical benchmarks and includes an analysis of how noise impacts the models relative to circuit depth.

### Strengths
The paper proposes two novel quantum models that leverage parameterized quantum circuits for the complex task of learning 3D models.
The authors conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of their proposed schemes, evaluating the number of parameters, gate count, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed quantum models achieve a significant performance improvement compared to classical benchmark algorithms.
The study includes a relevant analysis of the models' performance under noise, investigating their relationship with the number of circuit layers.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper proposes two architectures, but the DB QNeRF model shows almost no discernible advantage in the presented results. In terms of critical metrics like accuracy and parameter count, it does not appear to justify its inclusion. The authors should either provide a stronger rationale for this second approach or focus the paper on the more promising model.

2. The claim of efficiency is based primarily on a reduced parameter count, which is an incomplete metric for the real-world cost of a quantum algorithm. The analysis should be expanded to include measurement shots and state preparation costs.

3. The paper does not consider to address the trainability of the proposed PQC architectures. Variational quantum algorithms are notoriously prone to barren plateaus, which makes training ineffective, especially as the system size scales. The authors should provide theoretical or empirical evidence to show that their model design can mitigate or avoid this issue, thereby ensuring its potential for scalability.
