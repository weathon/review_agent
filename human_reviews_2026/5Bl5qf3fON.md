## Abstract
Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from drug discovery to circuit design. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between reference and data distributions. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations in the disjoint space of nodes/edges to build the path. This disentangled interpolation breaks the interconnected patterns of graphs, making the constructed probability path irregular and non-smooth, which causes poor training dynamics and faulty sampling convergence. To address the limitation, this paper first presents a theoretically grounded framework for probability path construction in graph generative models. Specifically, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design a smooth probability path that ensures the co-evolution of graph components. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that utilizes the derived optimal probability path to benefit the training and sampling algorithm design. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow with competitive performance, better training convergence, and efficient sampling.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel graph generation method using flow matching. First, it is pointed out that methods generating graphs via linear interpolation fail to smoothly change graph statistics, leading to poor flow velocity estimation accuracy and convergence gaps. Building upon this, the proposed method models a graph using Markov Random Field, estimates a vector field derived by the optimal transport on this model using the flow matching. Numerical experiments applied the proposed method to three graph generation tasks, 2D and 3D molecular graph generation tasks, verifying its generation performance.

### Strengths
1. (Originality) In graph generation tasks using flow matching, incorporating graph structure is non-trivial. This paper solves this issue by modeling a graph using the Markov Random Field. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to propose such a solution.
2. (Quality) There is design flexibility in how to set the velocity field in flow matching. This paper provides a theoretical background by employing the Optimal Transport. Furthermore, while optimal transport computations are typically high, the proposed method overcomes this problem using the Markov Random Field. This makes the approach practically implementable.
3. (Clarity) The writing is clear. It explains the necessary background knowledge (Markov Random Fields, Optimal Transport) to understand the proposed method. The mathematical descriptions are also appropriate. Therefore, I had no significant difficulties in understanding the paper's main points.
4. (Significance) Numerical experiments demonstrate generation performance of the proposed method surpasses existing methods, which strengthens the significance of the work in the area of graph generation research.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper points out that the problem with the existing methods is that they ignore graph structure and generate nodes and edges independently. However, the experiments verify the limitations of linear interpolations. Therefore, it seems unclear whether the problem lies in ignoring graph structure or in using linear interpolations.
2. I have a question about the interpretation of the results in Figure 3a. Looking at Figure 1a of the introduction, the authors assume that ideal interpolation changes graph statistics linearly. However, the discussion on Figure 3a suggests that it is desirable that statistics first increase and then decay. It seemingly contradicts the claim in Figure 1a and it would be more natural to claim that linear interpolation is preferable.

### Questions
1. I would like to clarify the experimental setting details for Figure 1a in the Introduction.
2. I would like the authors to address the question regarding the discussion of the results in Figure 3a, which is the second point under Weaknesses.

### Summary
This paper proposes Bures–Wasserstein Flow Matching (BWFlow), a generative modeling framework for graphs that integrates flow matching with the Bures–Wasserstein (BW) geometry on a Graph Markov Random Field (GraphMRF) representation. The authors first formalize graphs as random fields on nodes and edges (GraphMRF), establishing a Gaussian joint distribution whose covariance is tied to the graph Laplacian. They then derive a closed-form expression of the Bures–Wasserstein distance between two graphs, together with an analytical interpolation path and conditional velocity field, which enable flow matching without simulation. The method is further extended to a discrete version (with categorical node features and Bernoulli edges), and training/inference procedures are given. Comprehensive experiments on graph generation benchmarks are reported.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a mathematically coherent framework connecting graph optimal transport and flow matching. The closed-form derivations of the BW interpolation and velocity fields are valuable theoretical contributions.

2. Using the BW metric on graph Laplacians provides a geometrically meaningful way to measure and interpolate between graph distributions, which addresses a long-standing issue of linear interpolation violating graph manifold constraints.

3. The experimental section is relatively comprehensive, covering various types of graph data, including plain graphs, molecular graphs, and 3D molecular structures.

### Weaknesses
1. The methodological novelty is mainly compositional: the work combines existing Bures–Wasserstein distance (already applied to graph covariance learning) with the established flow-matching framework under a Graph MRF formulation, resulting in limited originality.

2. The empirical evaluation lacks consistency with standard benchmarks (e.g., DiGress, GruM, DeFoG) and omits common molecular-graph metrics such as Validity, Uniqueness, and Novelty. The results would be more convincing if experiments used the same datasets and evaluation metrics as prior baselines.

3. The paper does not isolate the effect of replacing Euclidean interpolation with the BW distance, nor does it provide a systematic comparison between the continuous and discrete variants. Without such analysis, it is unclear whether BW geometry truly contributes to the observed performance.

4. The notation system is heavy, and some equations are symbolically dense without intuitive explanation or visualization.

5. The paper does not mention a code release to ensure reproducibility.

### Questions
1. In Fig. 1(c), when flow steps = 1.0, the Time Distortion method yields a slightly smaller value than the BW interpolation. Does this imply that Time Distortion is comparably efficient in this setting?

2. Could the authors elaborate on the modeling assumption $p(\mathcal{G};\mathbf{G})=p(\mathcal{X};\mathbf{X},\mathbf{W})\cdot p(\mathcal{E};\mathbf{W})$? Why are the node features and edge structures conditionally independent, except for the coupling through 𝑊? How critical is this assumption for the GraphMRF formulation?

3. Does the model scale to large graphs?

### Summary
The paper proposes BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that constructs a smooth, joint probability path by modeling graphs as Markov random fields (MRFs) and leveraging optimal transport between MRFs. It argues that existing diffusion/flow methods use independent, linear node/edge interpolations that disrupt graph dependencies, leading to irregular paths and unstable training. By enforcing co-evolution of nodes and edges along the derived optimal path, BWFlow aims to improve training dynamics and sampling convergence. Experiments on plain graph and molecular generation report competitive or better performance, faster convergence, and more efficient sampling.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, clear, and methodologically sound, presenting complex ideas with precision and rigor.

It establishes a theoretical framework for probability-path construction directly within Markov Random Field (MRF) space, enabling coherent joint node–edge evolution that respects graph-structured dependencies.

It introduces a novel integration of MRFs with optimal transport, using MRFs as the ambient representation space for probability paths in a way that naturally aligns with graph topology and conditional dependencies.

### Weaknesses
While acknowledged in the limitations, BWFlow incurs substantial computational overhead, and reducing this cost appears non-trivial.

The experimental evaluation omits several GNN-based baselines, including DisCo (Xu et al., 2024), limiting the completeness of the comparison.

### Questions
Given the computational overhead, would a hybrid schedule be feasible—one that leverages linear interpolation for early stages and switches to the proposed BWFlow when most beneficial?


In Section A.3 there are cases where GraphMRF may be suboptimal for certain graph structures. Can structural information be injected to improve performance—for example, via higher-order graph features, subgraph/ motif features, or structural role embeddings?

### Summary
This paper studies the graph generation problem, via flow (matching) model. The notable point is that this paper formulates the graph with Markov Random Fields (MRFs) so that the interpolation on GraphMRFs can include the interaction between nodes and edges, greatly different from the previous work, whose node and edge interpolations are independent (Eq. 5). Some followup results, e.g., what is the closed-form interpolation, and the velocity at the interpolation point, are presented.

### Strengths
S1. Good motivation. "MRFs organize the nodes/edges as an interconnected system and interpolating between two MRFs captures the joint evolution of the graph system" sounds reasonable to me.

S2. This paper's presentation is nice. Even without checking the detailed mathematical derivations, I can still follow the story in the main content.

S3. The experimental results seem impressive.

### Weaknesses
Generally, i am satisfied about the quality of this paper. Here are some questions/suggestion which might be able to improve this paper.

Q1. From lines 66 to 82, it introduces the motivating example of this paper. It is a bit confusing why t=0.8 is such an important point. If this is purely empirical observation, or there are some mathematical reasons?

Q2. Can we understand the proposed method as a kind of latent diffusion/flow method, just like the stable diffusion did? I understand that the proposed method does not include an explicit encoder/decoder, and the I like the interpolations/velocity derived based on the colored
Gaussian distribution. Asking because the Figure 2 somewhat shows such a connection between flows in raw graph space and latent space.

Q3. About the OT paths. To be specific,

Q3.1. According to the Algorithm 1, the interpolation is on the OT path between a pair of G_0 and G_1, but not the in-batch OT coupling between a batch of {G_0} and {G_1}, is that right? But I think it should be easy to generalize to the mini-batch OT coupling setting as [1] did, is that right?

Q3.2 I can buy the story that "capture global co-evolution (Haasler & Frossard, 2024) of the graph components" for the interpolation is important, but whether the OT interpolation/path really matters? Asking because in many recent flow model studies, the straight line interpolation's best advantage is more on the efficiency (so fewer sampling steps), but not on the effectiveness.
