## Abstract
Extensive-form games (EFGs) provide a powerful framework for modeling sequential decision making, capturing strategic interaction under imperfect information, chance events, and temporal structure. Most positive algorithmic and theoretical results for EFGs assume perfect recall, where players remember all past information and actions. We study the increasingly relevant setting of imperfect-recall EFGs (IREFGs), where players may forget parts of their history or previously acquired information, and where equilibrium computation is provably hard. We propose sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies for computing ex-ante optimal strategies in single-player IREFGs and Nash equilibria in multi-player IREFGs, working over behavioral strategies. Our theoretical results show that (i) these hierarchies converge asymptotically, (ii) under genericity assumptions, the convergence is finite, and (iii) in single-player non-absentminded IREFGs, convergence occurs at a finite level determined by the number of information sets. Finally, we introduce the new classes of (SOS)-concave and (SOS)-monotone IREFGs, and show that in the single-player setting the SOS hierarchy converges at the first level, enabling equilibrium computation with a single semidefinite program (SDP).

### Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework for solving Imperfect-Recall Extensive-Form Games (IREFGs) by leveraging the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization hierarchy. The authors establish a formal connection between IREFGs and polynomial optimization, demonstrating that the SOS hierarchy provides asymptotic convergence to ex-ante optimal strategies in single-player games and Nash equilibria in multi-player games. The key theoretical contributions include proving finite convergence under genericity assumptions and, more importantly, identifying non-absentminded and SOS-monotone games where convergence is particularly efficient; in some cases, requiring only a single semidefinite program (SDP). This work offers a principled, global optimization approach to a problem known for its computational hardness.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides a comprehensive and unifying framework for IREFGs, transforming a game-theoretic problem into a structured optimization one with proven convergence guarantees.

2. Moving beyond general hardness results, the paper makes substantial progress by defining and analyzing tractable subclasses like non-absentminded and SOS-monotone games. The result that SOS-monotone games can be solved with a single SDP is a notable and practical insight.

### Weaknesses
1. A major limitation is the pronounced gap between theoretical guarantees and practical utility. The SOS hierarchy is known to produce very large SDPs whose size grows combinatorially with the number of variables and relaxation order. The authors do not adequately address this scalability issue, nor do they demonstrate applicability beyond small toy problems, which significantly limits the method's relevance to the community.

2. The paper is almost entirely theoretical. The minimal examples in the appendix serve as proofs-of-concept but do not constitute a meaningful empirical evaluation. There is no comparison against existing baselines (e.g., LP, GD, RM) to illustrate the practical trade-offs.

3. Even for moderately sized problems, SDP solvers can face numerical instability, preventing convergence or violating the "flatness" condition required to extract a solution. The paper does not address these practical algorithmic hurdles, presenting an idealized view of the optimization process.

4. There has been works solving imperfect-recall games that LP cannot solve [1-6]. They presented the first algorithm for approximating maxmin strategies in two-player zero-sum imperfect recall games without absentmindedness and several variants.

5. SOS has been applied in imperfect-recall games recently [7]. The novelty is limited.

### Questions
1. The theory guarantees that SOS converges to a global optimum, whereas methods like LP, GD, or RM may only reach local optima (KKT points). Could you provide a concrete and non-trivial IREFG instance where your method is guaranteed to find the only correct solution, thereby clarifying its unique practical value beyond theoretical appeal?

2. The feasibility of your approach rests heavily on solving the underlying SDPs. Could you include a quantitative scaling analysis—for instance, a table relating the total number of strategic variables n and relaxation order d to the resulting SDP size (i.e., moment matrix dimension)? This would help the community gauge the realistic scope of application given current solvers.

3. In your experiments, how frequently did the SDP solver fail or fail to meet the flatness condition? What is your fallback strategy when the SOS relaxation at a tractable order d does not yield an extractable solution?

4. How can your method reliably assert the non-existence of Nash equilibria in IREFGs within bounded computation time?

5. What's the advantage of SOS against Gurobi optimizer, which guarantees global optimality upon finishing solving.

### Summary
The paper studies imperfect-recall games and whether Moment Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy provides computational benefits to some subclasses of those games. The paper shows that in non-abstentminded games, the Moment-SOS hierarchy converges in finite time even with single instantiation of hierarchy both in single-player and multi-player settings. In absent-minded games, the method converges asymptotically to a Nash equilibrium (or it proves it's nonexistence) with multiple instantiations of the hierarchy. The authors then define SOS-certifiable counterparts of concave and monotone games and show that in single-player SOS-monotone games, the Moment-SOS converges using only a single SDP.

### Strengths
* Improves one of the hardness-results for single-player imperfect recall games.
* Deepens the connection between Moment-SOS and the polynomial games, which was proposed in [1].
* Provides practical usage of Moment-SOS for imperfect recall games and the behavior of Moment-SOS for some subclasses of those game.

### Weaknesses
* Most of the results seem to directly follow from the definition of imperfect recall games as a polynomial game, the construction provided in [1] and the behavior of Moment-SOS.
* Without the prior knowledge the concepts introduced in Section 2.2 would be really difficult to follow, which authors probably realized and provided 2 works that delve more into those concepts. 
* The clashing notation of SOS and games makes the paper difficult to follow at first. Some notational details are not defined like $\mu_{-i}$ (specifically the use of the negative subscript index) or the sum of multi-indices $\alpha + \beta$,
* Little empirical evidence supporting the theory.

### Questions
1. You have defined SOS-concave games, but have not used this property anywhere. Are there any computational benefits of those games (except the fact, they have a behavioral Nash)?
2. The SVC method seems to follow similar procedure as the double oracle algorithm. Is there some connection between those methods?

### Summary
The paper investigates the use of the sum of squares (SoS) relaxation hierarchy as a tool to solve imperfect-recall games. The paper uses various results from the SoS literature that, when carried over to the game setting, yield results regarding the convergence of the SoS hierarchy to equilibria in games.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and clear. I find the idea of using SoS as a relaxation for imperfect recall games very interesting; indeed, it is an idea that I myself have toyed around with a bit, albeit without much progress.

### Weaknesses
The paper should also cite and compare to [1, 2], which covers timeable two-player zero-sum imperfect-recall games (team games). The techniques used in these papers, although not SoS, are basically "lift-and-project"-style algorithms, and have the same flavor of complexity that depends on a "degree-like" parameter, which the papers characterize. 

My main criticism is that the paper feels a bit preliminary. The results follow mostly from basically restating known results in SoS land once one has expressed the program of finding an equilibrium as a polynomial feasibility program. It seems that one could have written this paper about just about any class of problems that can be reduced to polynomial optimization, and that's a lot of problems. What makes *games* special here? I was hoping to see more analysis of special things that happen in imperfect-recall games.

See *Questions* below for more specific ideas/questions about this.

My rating is negative, but again, I think that the idea is interesting. I think that with further development this can be a very strong paper.

[2] BH Zhang, T Sandholm (AAAI 2022) "Team correlated equilibria in zero-sum extensive-form games via tree decompositions"

### Questions
1.  Do you have some understanding of *at what degree* the relaxation becomes tight in general? For example, [1, 2] relate the size (dimension) of their lifted strategy set to the information structure of the game, which is kind of like the degree of the SoS relaxation. Can you make a similar statement beyond their setting of timeable games? What would that look like?

2. The paper introduces SoS-concave and SoS-monotone games, but doesn't seem to do much with them. I am left with more questions that I started with. For example, what sorts of games are SoS-concave or SoS-monotone? Why should I care about this class of games, beyond "they are the class of games for which Theorem 6.3 can be proven"?

### Summary
This submission employs sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies for computing Nash equilibrium (working on behavioral strategies) in imperfect-recall extensive-form games (IREFGs), where players may forget information previously available to them during gameplay, and computation of solution concepts are harder than the perfect recall case, even with a single-player. They show that for single-player IREFGs, SOS hierarchy converges asymptotically to the maximum possible (ex-ante optimal) utility in the game, that the convergence is finite under a genericity assumption, and that in games without absentmindedness (no information set gets visited multiple times during gameplay), the convergence can be bounded by the number of infosets in the game. Similarly, the authors show that for multi-player IREFGs, multiple instantiations of the SOS hierarchy can be used to converge to behavioral Nash equilibria if its exists (again in finite steps under certain assumptions), and certify non-existence otherwise. Lastly, they define the SOS-monotone and SOS-concave IREFGs, which are subsclasses of IREFGs where the computation of their method becomes more tractable.

### Strengths
1) The tackles an important problem that has been receiving increasingly popular attention. The authors do an excellent job covering some of the recent (and more classic) related literature on imperfect recall games, and motivate their setting by discussing their applications in solving large games via abstractions, modeling team games, and for safety & security. The existing negative results are clearly presented and therefore it is very clear where the contributions of this paper fits in the literature. 

2) The theoretical analysis is rigorous and aptly exploits the connection between imperfect recall games and polynomial optimization to make full use of the sum of squares hierarchies. The assumptions needed for their various positive results are clearly given. 

3) The paper is generally well-written with a clear organization. The sections nicely connect to and build on top of each other.

### Weaknesses
1) At times the paper becomes incredibly dense with overwhelmingly many definitions and notation. I found sections 2.2 and 3 particularly difficult to follow for someone without significant experience in sum of squares / polynomial optimization. While this is somewhat inevitable due to the many concepts required for defining both imperfect-recall extensive-form games and SOS hierarchies and the limited space, it does end up decreasing the accessibility of the paper. I would suggest the authors to use the 10th content page they get during the rebuttal process to provide intuitions for the many definitions presented while introducing SOS hierarchies. 

2) Pretty much all proofs are deferred to the appendix. Once again, there is not much the authors can do about this due to the page limit, but providing proof sketches for the main theorems can be extremely helpful in understanding and appreciating the technical novelty required for the proofs, which is currently not clear without looking at the appendix.

3) While the definitions for SOS-concave and SOS-monotone IREFGs are clear and lead to nice tractability results, the authors do not give any examples of natural games that would fall into this category. Motivating the applicability of these subclasses by discussing settings in which they can arise (especially in relationship to the settings discussed in the introduction for motivating IREFGs) would significantly strengthen section 6. 

Minor:
- abstract: SDP acronym used without being introduced.
- l136: $\mathcal{H} \notin \mathcal{Z}$ -> $\mathcal{H} \setminus \mathcal{Z}$ 
- l152: "a distribution $\mu(...)$" -> should be $\mu_i$
- l175 "i.e., no player can profitably deviate from $\mu^*$ at any of their information sets." This sounds more like the description of EDT equilibria, since it can be interpreted as each player being able to change their strategy at only a single information set. It would be nice to make it clear that multi-information set deviations are also allowed.
- line219: why not just use $\pi$ for nodes in EFGs to begin with instead of overloading $h$?
- l279 "optmality" typo
- l280 "active gradients" repeated
- l412 "Leverage" -> "Leveraging"

### Questions
1) The KKT conditions of each individual player’s optimization problem exactly correspond CDT equilibria, a solution concept weaker than Nash [Tewolde 2023,2024]. Does (ii) of Theorem 4.1 imply that under the genericity assumption, all CDT equilibria (KKT points) are ex ante optimal? Also, can the verify-cut steps in Section 5 be removed to compute CDT equilibria (that are not necessarily Nash)? If so, what can we say about the improvements to the convergence guarantees?

2) l105 briefly mention perfect-recall refinement, which are an important concept for computing the value of recall of IREFGs (see Berker et al. 2025, "Value of Recall in Extensive-Form Games"). It seems a straightforward adaptation of the SOS-based methods introduced in your paper can be used for computing the value of recall in games as well through the naive approach of computing the ex ante optimal utility of the IREFG, and then solving the perfect-recall refinement exactly (which is at least easy for single-player or 2p0s games), and compare these utilities. Do you think there might be ways to apply SOS hierarchies to compute value of recall in ways more efficient than this naive approach (i.e. without computing the ex-ante optimal utilities directly)?
