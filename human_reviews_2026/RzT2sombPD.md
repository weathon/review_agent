## Abstract
Synthetic time series are vital for data augmentation, stress testing, and prototyping in quantitative finance. Yet in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{CTBench}, the first \textbf{C}ryptocurrency \textbf{T}ime series generation \textbf{Bench}mark. It curates an open-source dataset of 452 tokens and evaluates models across 13 metrics spanning forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: the Predictive Utility measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while the Statistical Arbitrage assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We systematically benchmark eight state-of-the-art models from five TSG families across four market regimes, revealing trade-offs between statistical quality and real-world profitability. Notably, CTBench provides ranking analysis and practical guidance for deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and trading applications.

### Summary
CTBench is the benchmark tailored for Time Series Generation  in cryptocurrency markets, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks in domain generality, task scope, and crypto-specific evaluation. It features a curated dataset of OHLC data, dual-task evaluation, 13 financial metrics across 5 dimensions, and 8 TSG models from 5 families. Experiments across bull, volatile, consolidation, and mean-reverting regimes reveal trade-offs between statistical fidelity and trading profitability. CTBench enables rigorous TSG evaluation for crypto trading, bridging synthetic data generation with practical financial utility.

### Strengths
1. Captures unique traits of crypto markets including 24/7 volatility, absence of intrinsic valuation and irregular liquidity that are not addressed in traditional benchmarks.
2. Links TSG to real-world use cases through two complementary tasks focusing on forecasting capabilities and tradable signal extraction rather than just statistical similarity.
3. Integrates 13 diverse metrics covering error measurement, rank correlation, trading performance, risk assessment and computational efficiency for comprehensive evaluation of synthetic data’s financial utility.
4. Benchmarks 8 representative TSG models spanning five architectural families across four distinct market regimes, delivering actionable scenario-specific recommendations for practitioners.

### Weaknesses
1. Relies solely on Binance’s spot hourly data, lacking the diversity of cross-exchange data, alternative crypto asset types such as futures contracts, and different sampling frequencies. Besides, it remains unknown whether this generation method can be effectively extended to a broader range of asset classes, which limits the method’s scalability.
2. All TSG models' generated data are used with the same XGBoost model for downstream prediction. Different TSG models may be better suited for different types of predictors as some models like Transformer are more sensitive to long-term dependencies, so using a fixed predictor may introduce evaluation bias and fail to fully reflect the generality of the generated data.
3. Diffusion-based models included in the benchmark may exhibit long training and inference times, providing comparisons of generation efficiency across different models would help alleviate concerns in this regard.

### Summary
This paper provides an open-source cryptocurrency dataset and the first benchmark for time series generation in cryptocurrency, named CTBench. Moreover, it introduces a novel dual-task evaluation framework to assess how well the temporal dynamics captured by synthetic data can be used for downstream forecasting and whether they can reconstruct market structure and isolate tradable signals. CTBench specifically evaluates the capability of eight state-of-the-art generative models for time series, using abundant metrics in different financial applications. Experimental results benchmark the performance of synthetic data from tested generative models.

### Strengths
- This paper offers a valuable open-source cryptocurrency dataset, which bridges the gap between research on time series generation and cryptocurrency.
    
- The benchmark discussed in this paper is comprehensive, involving most of recent deep generative models and evaluation metrics widely used in finance.
    
- This paper provides some intriguing practical findings that are critical for future research and applications: (i) current generative models achieve diverse performance across tasks, none of them can outperform others across all tasks and metrics; (ii) in statistical arbitrage task, different generative models are sensitive to distinct scenarios; (iii) noise in financial data is important as well.
    
- Beyond the above performance, this paper further evaluates the efficiency of generative models.
    
- The writing of this paper is well-structured and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
- The predictive utility task fixes the forecasting model to XGBoost for its robustness and interpretability. However, some conclusions may change with alternative predictors, given that different setups have large impacts on the model performance.
    
- [Minor] Dual-task evaluation module in Figure 2 is visually unclear. Perhaps its readability can be improved by simplifying the contents like the other modules, since Figure 3 already shows the details.

### Questions
- Is it possible that generative models may have different performance using forecasting models other than XGBoost?
    
- Are all feature windows strictly backward-looking and computed within the split? Are any scalers fit only on training data? Do all the results hold using different splits?

- A small typo: Citation formatting at line 041 is incorrect.

### Summary
The paper introduces CTBench, an open-source benchmark for crypto time‑series generation. It provides a curated, hourly panel of 452 USDT pairs on Binance (2020–2024) and a two-track evaluation for crypto time-series generation. Representative generators are tested across four market regimes using a finance-first metric stack that spans several aspects. The results document model utility in different regimes.

### Strengths
- Empirically, the authors observe the regime-dependent trade-offs between fidelity and tractability, i.e., high fidelity does not directly imply tradability. This is an important insight for generating synthetic financial data.

- Emphasizing rank-based metrics and arbitrage capacity over purely generative scores moves the discussion toward decision-useful validation.

- The authors offer useful guidance on model selection for practical uses.

### Weaknesses
- Results are tied to a single forecasting model. Without testing a variety of forecasters, it’s unclear whether conclusions generalize.

- Insufficient diagnostic analysis of model performance differentials. The paper does not investigate why the TSG models diverge in outcomes, leaving the observations unexplained.

### Questions
- Do you evaluate the covariance and eigenspectrum alignment between synthetic and real returns? This might explain why Fourier-Flow yields stable rank metrics but limited arbitrage.

- Compared with those used in finance economics, such as ARMA-GARCH and the bootstrap, do the learning-based TSG models provide better synthetic data?

- Have you tested alternative forecasters (e.g., linear model, random forest, and MLP)? Do the relative model performance and rankings persist?
