- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 0, 8, 6

## Abstract
Automatic seizure detection and classification from electroencephalography (EEG) hold significant potential to enhance epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. However, deep learning approaches often suffer from limited generalization ability to unseen patients due to inter-patient variability in EEG. While existing studies primarily focus on model architecture design or pre-training strategies to alleviate the problem, the optimization framework for robust cross-patient generalization, especially under the inherently spatiotemporal structure of EEG, remains underexplored. In this work, we propose SpatioTemporal Distributionally Robust Optimization (STDRO), a novel method to improve cross-patient seizure analysis in parallel to existing architectural/pre-training solutions. STDRO constructs and learns structured uncertainty sets that explicitly capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG signals, thereby inducing data-adaptive worst-case distributions for robust optimization and improving cross-patient generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of STDRO as a plug-and-play approach to consistently enhance state-of-the-art seizure detection and classification models across diverse evaluation scenarios. Our work advances robust EEG-based seizure analysis toward practical applications with cross-patient scenarios.

### Summary
This paper introduces STDRO, a spatiotemporal distributionally robust optimization framework for cross-patient EEG seizure detection and classification.

The proposed method enhances existing architectures (DCRNN, GraphS4former, VQ-MTM) with a new optimization objective that learns uncertainty sets capturing EEG spatial correlations and temporal dependencies. These uncertainty sets are parameterized by learnable matrices and regularized through a “stability objective” designed to reduce performance gaps between patient groups.

STDRO is presented as a plug-and-play training strategy applicable to any architecture, and it demonstrates moderate improvements on the TUSZ and CHB-MIT datasets.

### Strengths
- The Introduction and Related Work sections are well written and supported by numerous references covering the various aspects discussed in the paper.


- Topic Relevance: Cross-patient generalization is a fundamental and challenging problem in EEG analysis, and addressing it from an optimization rather than an architectural or pretraining perspective is an interesting direction.

### Weaknesses
- Figure 1: The figure lacks visual clarity, particularly the box in the bottom-right corner, which looks messy.
- Optimization complexity: The method substantially alters the optimization problem, making it potentially much harder to tune. There is no analysis or evidence illustrating how this affects training stability, convergence, or runtime. The added bi-level optimization seems to introduce major complexity for relatively small empirical gains.
- Objective formulation: The objective remains vague and underspecified. The definition of the stability term and patient grouping strategy appears arbitrary. The learnable matrix Mₜ is poorly explained. Its structure and dimensionality are unclear, and there is no intuition for what it learns or how it interacts with Wₜ.
- Inconsistent improvements: There is no explanation for the large variability in reported gains (e.g., from +58% to +69% in one setup but only +0–5% in others).
- Statistical significance: The lack of significance testing is a serious issue. Given the small differences in performance, it’s entirely possible that the improvements are not meaningful. Ablation studies should include multiple seeds or data splits to assess robustness.
- Splitting protocol: TUSZ has an official split, yet the authors use a 90/10 random split, breaking the standard evaluation protocol and compromising comparability. CHB-MIT lacks a predefined split, so proper cross-validation is expected but not described.
- Visualization: The covariate-weight figures are illustrative but fail to demonstrate how or why STDRO improves robustness.
- Presentation: The paper is algebraically overloaded. Core ideas should be kept concise in the main text, with derivations moved to the appendix.
- Generality: The method is heavily tailored to seizure datasets, suggesting limited transferability to other time-series tasks without further validation.
- Metrics: The authors only report sample-based metrics (F1, AUROC), while the field is increasingly shifting toward event-based metrics (IoU, IoU@0.5) that better capture the real objective of seizure detection. Reporting F1 for comparison is fine, but including event-level metrics would have provided a more complete picture.

### Questions
1. Code release: Since STDRO is designed as a plug-and-play optimization layer, do you plan to release the implementation publicly to facilitate reproducibility and adoption?

2. Statistical validation: Could you include statistical significance tests (e.g., across seeds or splits) in the ablation and main results to confirm that the observed improvements are robust and meaningful?

3. Training behavior: Can you provide more insight into the practical impact of the proposed optimization on training dynamics (compute time, stability, and convergence) compared to standard baselines?

4. Hyperparameter sensitivity: How sensitive are your results to the choice of α and β in Eq. (2)? Some intuition or plots showing their influence would clarify how to tune the method.

5. Interpretability of Mₜ: Could you offer a more intuitive explanation or visualization of what the learnable matrix Mₜ actually learns and how it interacts with the fixed Wₜ during training?

6. Split protocol and reproducibility: For TUSZ, the 90/10 random split deviates from the predefined standard. Or maybe you use it? Could you clarify how you ensured patient disjointness and comparability with prior work?

7. Generalization beyond seizure data: Have you tried (or could you speculate on) applying STDRO to other time series (other EEG datasets like BCI tasks or other signals like ECG) to test its claimed generality?

### Summary
This paper provides a highly complex optimisation approach for EEG data, which is plug-&-play for existing EEG-seizure datasets and architectures. This is a new take, because prior work usually looked at this problem from an architecture perspective. It is supposed to do temporal localisation of EEG to find when in the multichannel stream a seizure happened and also classify the seizure type.

### Strengths
Gives great results and beats SOTA.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, the paper is not well organized. There is too much nomenclature, and it just feels like there is a lack of focus. The more one reads, the more stuff is discovered: uncertainty sets, dynamics, spatial correlations, spatio-temporal constraints, stability, adversarial optimisation, bilevel optimisation with relaxation, multi-environment objectives, wassertian distance, graph learning, transportation cost functions etc. All of this makes for a very confusing read. Because of this, I believe that the paper is very incoherent and not suitable for publication at the moment.

### Questions
What do they mean by ‘spatial correlations’? Are they referring to the use of multi-channel EEG information? How is that different from ‘dimensional variance’? It feels like the words channel, dimensions, and spatial are used interchangeably.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework that incorporates EEG spatio-temporal structure and patient-group-wise stability to learn the uncertainty set from training data. This framework is proposed in the context of seizure detection and classification, aiming to gain generalization across patients. Optimization for the seizure detection/classification model and the data perturbation are done alternatively. The proposed framework when combined with different models show consistent performance improvement on 2 seizure classification/detection benchmarks TUSZ and CHB-MIT.

### Strengths
The idea of using DRO on EEG to improve cross-patient generalization is sensible and, to my best knowledge, is new in the EEG domain.

The proposal to incorporate the EEG-specific constraints related to spatiotemporal structure and group-wise stability is interesting as well, showing the importance of these domain-knowledge in modelling. The bi-level optimization problem framing is reasonable.

The evaluation results obtained by combining the proposed standalone framework with multiple existing models leading to consistent performance improvements are convincing. The ablation study further supports the technical contributions in the work.

### Weaknesses
It lacks some analyses that would be interesting to shed more light on what happens underneath. For example, looking at a confusion matrix with and without STDRO to understand what the model does by learning on the worst case scenario vs the average scenario.

Using average EEG signals to cluster patients appears to be suboptimal. It would be interesting to see how the groups formed by this clustering align with clinical/physiological/demographic characteristics of the patients.

It only uses seizure detection and classification to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed framework. I believe it would be useful for other EEG tasks as well and evaluation on more EEG tasks would showcase the generalization of the framework. 

Even though the framework is plug-and-play, there are no analyses on the complexity and computational cost. Particularly it involves bi-level optimization and building spatio-temporal graphs.

### Questions
- In seizure classification performance, the framework seems to trade precision for recall. Is this an expected result by modeling based on the uncertainty set learned by the framework? Could you comment more about this?

- How can we interpret the resulting uncertainty set in terms of the distributional shift from the average scenario, making learning from it leads to better performance on the test set? Does it also mean that the model trained on the uncertainty set works less well on the average training subjects? 

- Could you comment on the sensitivity of hyperparameters like number of time periods, regularization terms for stability and temporal smoothness, etc.?

### Summary
This paper proposes Spatiotemporal Distributionally Robust Optimization (STDRO), an optimization framework to enhance cross-patient generalization in EEG-based seizure detection and classification. Its functionality involves constructing and learning uncertainty sets in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) that explicitly incorporate the spatiotemporal structure of EEG signals. Extensive experiments on the TUSZ and CHB-MIT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths
As a optimization-centric approach, STDRO seamlessly integrates with pre-training (e.g., VQ-MTM) and different types of network architectures. 

Experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and clip durations. Ablation studies validates the benefit of each component (spatiotemporal structure and stability). 

STDRO's uncertainty sets are data-adaptive, leveraging EEG's spatial correlations and temporal continuity, which is well-motivated.

### Weaknesses
While the method is empirically strong, given it is an optimization based approach, I would encourage the authors to provide more theoretical analysis on the benefit of the proposed approach for robustness and generalization.

Currently the work lacks comparison with other DRO-based EEG decoding approaches such as [1], which raises doubt on the contribution of this work. It also lacks discussion with EEG decoding approaches that also target robustness improvement [2]. 

I would encourage the authors to explore the sensitivity of the proposed work towards some of the other hyper-parameters such as alpha, beta etc. Which is currently missing.
