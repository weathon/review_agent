## Abstract
Hydrological report generation is crucial for monitoring clouds, typhoons, rainfall, and water events, yet current multimodal models struggle with multi-image alignment and domain-specific knowledge integration. We present HydroGen, a domain-adaptive framework that overcomes these challenges through instruction tuning, temporal modeling, and knowledge-guided reasoning within a two-stage pipeline. First, we build HydroMM-Instruct, an instruction dataset that uses YOLOv8 for typhoon detection and shapefiles for region mapping, with reports standardized into cause–effect phrases. Second, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline with continual pre-training on hydrological data (radar maps, pressure charts, expert assessments) followed by supervised fine-tuning for report generation. Third, to enhance multi-image alignment, we introduce temporal prompt tokens that capture event sequences and progressions. Finally, we present GuideAC, an in-context agent that injects antecedent–consequence rules to improve reasoning. Evaluation on Thailand’s weekly hydrological reports (2018–2025) shows that HydroGen substantially outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving a BERT-F1 of 84.56\% (+46.96\%) and a ROUGE-L of 67.78\% (+61.48\%).

### Summary
This paper presents HydroGen, a domain-adaptive multimodal framework for generating hydrological reports. The system integrates satellite images, air pressure maps, and expert-written reports through a novel two-stage training pipeline. The authors construct a specialized instruction dataset (HydroMM-Instruct) and propose enhancements such as temporal prompt tokens and a causal reasoning agent (GuideAC). Evaluation on Thailand’s weekly hydrological reports (2018–2025) shows HydroGen significantly outperforms both open-source and proprietary multimodal baselines across semantic and syntactic metrics.

### Strengths
1. The paper identifies a gap in the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for hydrological report generation, addressing the unique challenges of multi-image alignment, temporal reasoning, and domain knowledge integration.
2. The authors design a two-stage training approach (continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning), supported by a curated multimodal dataset with cause–effect narrative normalization.
3. The use of temporal prompt tokens for image sequencing and the GuideAC module for causal rule integration are well-motivated in this context.
4. The model achieves substantial improvements over strong baselines (e.g., GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro), showing +50.6% in BERT-F1 and +33.9% in ROUGE-L, which convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
5. The paper includes an ablation study, component-wise analysis, and comparisons across both small and large models, offering clear insight into the contribution of each component.

### Weaknesses
1. Despite spanning multiple years, the instruction dataset is relatively small (376 reports with 4,935 images), which raises concerns about robustness and model generalization in unseen scenarios or edge cases.
2. Several components—especially text rewriting and rule extraction—use Gemini-2.5-Pro heavily. While practical, this introduces dependency on external proprietary systems and may hinder reproducibility.
3. While performance metrics are strong, the paper lacks a systematic analysis of failure cases or qualitative errors in generated reports, which would be helpful for understanding limitations and guiding future improvements.

### Questions
1. How does HydroGen handle conflicting signals from visual and textual data (e.g., satellite images suggesting different outcomes than pressure maps)?
2. Is the model evaluated on any out-of-distribution samples, such as events not seen during training (e.g., rare typhoon patterns or novel flood zones)?
3. How sensitive is the system to errors in the typhoon detection stage (YOLOv8)? Has error propagation from this module been quantified?
4. Could the authors elaborate on the rule aggregation strategy used in GuideAC? Specifically, how are redundant or contradictory rules handled?

### Summary
This paper proposes HydroGen, a multimodal framework for generating hydrological reports in Thailand. This framework addresses the challenges of applying multimodal large language models in the hydrological domain through a two-stage training strategy (continuous pre-training and supervised fine-tuning), temporal cue tagging, and the knowledge-guided causal inference agent GuideAC. The authors constructed the HydroMM-Instruct dataset, used YOLOv8 for typhoon detection, and normalized the reports to a causal format. Evaluations on weekly hydrological reports in Thailand from 2018 to 2025 show that HydroGen significantly outperforms baseline models.

### Strengths
1. Solved the practical need for automated generation of hydrological reports in Thailand
2. A complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training to inference

### Weaknesses
1. The test set spans only 2-3 months (April-June 2025), approximately 8-9 weekly reports. This is problematic as it misses typhoon season (July-October) and dry season patterns, making performance claims questionable. A full annual cycle is needed for reliable evaluation.
2. With only 376 reports from a single Thai source, the dataset is too small for deep learning and too geographically restricted for international venues. The model cannot generalize beyond Thailand without region-specific shapefiles and hydrological patterns. This work seems better suited for regional journals rather than ICLR.
3. No systematic expert evaluation of generated reports or validation of Gemini-extracted causal rules. The paper needs: (i) blind expert rating comparing generated vs. real reports, (ii) accuracy assessment of auto-extracted causal relationships against expert annotations, and (iii) cross-model consistency checks.
4. The approach primarily combines existing techniques (LLaVA + YOLOv8 + LoRA) without novel contributions. Temporal prompts are just position encodings, and GuideAC relies on external LLMs rather than end-to-end learning. Missing opportunities to incorporate hydrological constraints or spatiotemporal dependencies.

### Questions
1. Have the authors considered integrating hydrological data from other countries or regions? How would they address the issue of data heterogeneity?

2. Why choose simple location encoding instead of more complex temporal modeling methods (such as temporal attention mechanisms)?

3. How well does the model perform when handling extreme weather events (such as rare typhoon tracks)?

### Summary
This paper introduces HydroGen, a domain-adaptive multimodal framework designed for hydrological report generation that integrates satellite imagery, air pressure maps, and textual data through instruction tuning and knowledge-guided reasoning. Unlike generic multimodal models that struggle with temporal alignment and domain-specific causal inference, HydroGen leverages temporal prompts and expert rules to produce coherent, cause–effect hydrological narratives. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Thailand’s weekly hydrological reports, significantly surpassing strong multimodal baselines in both semantic and syntactic accuracy.

The contributions are:

1. Development of HydroMM-Instruct, the first multimodal instruction dataset for hydrological reporting, integrating YOLOv8-based typhoon detection, shapefile mapping, and cause–effect style standardization.

2. Proposal of a two-stage training framework combining continual pre-training on hydrological corpora with supervised fine-tuning for expert-style report generation.

3. Introduction of temporal prompt tokens to capture chronological dependencies across multi-image sequences, improving temporal coherence in generated narratives.

4. Design of GuideAC, a knowledge-guided agent that incorporates antecedent–consequence hydrological rules to enhance causal reasoning and factual consistency

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a multimodal framework specifically designed for hydrological report generation, marking a novel and timely contribution to the intersection of multimodal LLM and environmental science.
2. The introduction of temporal prompt tokens and the GuideAC causal reasoning agent represents a creative and effective approach to improving temporal coherence and factual accuracy in scientific text generation.
4. The experiments are rigorous and comprehensive, with both quantitative and qualitative evaluations against strong baselines (e.g., GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro) that clearly validate the model’s superiority.
5. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

### Weaknesses
1. Since the model is only trained on Thailand’s hydrological reports, I believe some OOD evaluation is necessary to assess generalization across other countries.
2. The paper lacks discussion of scalability and computational efficiency, which limits understanding of deployment feasibility for larger datasets or real-time systems.
3. In table 2 for Gemma3-4B, the semantic similarity score is significantly worse after SFT, even 20% worse than CPT only. How can we interpret this?
4. My biggest concern is that the novelty of the paper mainly comes from the dataset construction, but the dataset has a very narrow scope, limited to reports from Thailand only. This restricts geographical diversity and generalizability, which is a major limitation for a model intended for scientific use across different regions.

### Summary
This paper presents HydroGen, a multimodal large language model for hydrological report generation. The system integrates domain-adaptive instruction tuning, temporal prompt design, and knowledge-guided reasoning through an in-context module (GuideAC). Trained on HydroMM-Instruct, a curated dataset of Thai hydrology reports, HydroGen employs a two-stage domain adaptation framework to enhance temporal understanding and causal coherence. Experiments show that HydroGen, particularly with the Typhoon2 backbone, surpasses strong open- and closed-source baselines.

### Strengths
1. Temporal and Causal Reasoning: innovative use of temporal prompt tokens for structuring sequences of satellite images and air pressure maps directly addresses one of the key bottlenecks of hydrological narrative alignment.
2. Knowledge-guided Inference: GuideAC—the knowledge-injection module—extracts, aggregates, and prompts with robust, expert-driven causal rules.
3. Actionable Architectural Insights: The ablation section reveals how each model ingredient (domain adaptation, temporal prompts, knowledge guidance) contributes to gains, providing researchers with clear guidance for extending to other scientific reporting use cases.

### Weaknesses
1. Potential for Benchmark Overfit: Most baselines are evaluated only on the Thai hydrological reports, not on out-of-domain datasets, thus it remains unclear whether HydroGen’s architectural innovations generalize to other climate, disaster, or scientific summary domains.
2. Can the authors explicitly quantify the impact of translation and language-specific modeling? Are the reported metrics based on Thai-only or on translated data, and does translation step introduce inconsistency (especially for domain-specific terms)?
3. Rule Extraction and Aggregation Details Insufficient: The procedure for extracting, filtering, and embedding antecedent-consequence rules via GuideAC is described at a high level, with implementation details deferred to the appendix. However, it is unclear how sensitive the generation performance is to rule noise, coverage, or potential brittleness—especially across different time windows. There is no empirical quantification of potential failure cases, such as cascading errors from incorrect or ambiguous rules, nor clear ablation isolating GuideAC’s impact beyond descriptive metrics.
4. Could the authors clarify if HydroGen, with the current architecture and prompts, successfully adapts to new regional datasets or different languages, or does it require significant re-engineering? For example, have any pilot studies been performed outside of the Thai hydrological corpus?
5. Table 1 shows significant performance gains, but could the authors provide specific error analysis or failure cases illustrating where HydroGen still falters—such as hallucinations, missed causal links, or incorrect temporal ordering?
