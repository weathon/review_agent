## Abstract
A Bayesian inference approach to symbolic regression offers a combination of two powerful interpretability properties.
On its own, symbolic regression offers explainable, unconstrained, closed-form expressions.
However, combined with Bayesian inference, symbolic regression provides probability distributions over these interpretable models, accounting for real-world, limited, noisy data.
Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR) is an algorithm that uses neural networks to perform symbolic regression; however, it aims to locate a single expression that best fits the data, rather than to calculate posteriors.
In this work, we introduce Deep Variational Inference Symbolic Regression (DVISR).
DVISR extends DSR into a fully Bayesian approach to symbolic regression by replacing the reward function used to train the network with the inner part of the expectation of the evidence lower bound.
DVISR also modifies the architecture of the network to output probability distributions over constants within the expressions.
This architectural modification enables the computation of the posterior distributions over both the expression trees and the constants contained within them.
We show that DVISR can recover the true posterior distribution in simple settings and demonstrate scaling properties as the expression sizes get larger.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new algorithm, termed Deep Variational Inference Symbolic Regression (DVISR), for conducting Bayesian inference for symbolic regression. The algorithm leverages recursive neural networks (RNNs) to learn a distribution over the expression tree of mathematical expressions. DVISR is able to learn a distribution over both the constants, as well as, the expression structure. Empirical results are demonstrated on a small set of synthetic datasets coming from known mathematical expressions.

### Strengths
There is a growing interest in symbolic expression and developing methods that ensure that we can capture the uncertainty of the expression structure in addition to the parameter certainty seems worthwhile. The paper in general is well written and the method well motivated.

### Weaknesses
There are two primary weaknesses which cause me to recommend rejection at this stage: 1) weak empirical validation of DVISR, and 2) insufficient discussion of related work/consideration of relevant work.

**Weak Empirical Evaluation**

The empirical evaluation of this algorithm is limited solely to synthetic datasets with a maximum of 11 data points and data generated from very simple expressions.  The Section 3.1.1 experiment only considers 4 candidate expressions for which we can analytically compute the posterior, therefore this problem setting doesn't require a very complex algorithm in the first place. Section 3.1.2 considers more candidate expressions but as far as I can tell there is no evidence that the algorithm actually converges on the true expression. The final experiment in Section 3.2 is the only experiment that considers doing inference over both the form of the expression and the constants within the expression, but this section only considers 7 candidate expression.

*Overall, there is no experiment which tests the algorithm on real-world data, no experiment that could not be feasibly solved with a naive brute-force approach and, in general, no comparison to existing baselines.* While the paper explicitly mentions the experimental validation as a weakness of the paper, the current evaluation provides me with very little useful evidence of whether I would actually want to use this algorithm on a real-world dataset.

**Insufficient discussion of existing work**

The research field of probabilistic programming has a wide history of deriving general purpose Bayesian inference algorithms for arbitrary probabilistic programs, sometimes referred to as universal probabilistic programming [1,2]. The symbolic regression problem can be framed as inference in a universal probabilistic program and there is a wealth of papers with empirical results for the task of symbolic regression, also sometimes referred to as function induction or program synthesis [2,3,4,5,6] (this is not necessarily an exhaustive list). In general, the algorithms have been shown to scale to be able to do inference in 100s or even 1000s of expression tree while also inferring the constants and applying the algorithms to real-world data. Many of these algorithms are based on ideas from variational inference [2,3,8,9,10,11], so they could be used as relevant baselines to compare DVISR against. Overall, the probabilistic programming algorithms aim to solve a more general inference problem formulation than the symbolic approach, so I definitely see scope for deriving inference algorithms specifically targeted towards symbolic regression. However, the paper should at least discuss how the DVISR approach compares against these more general algorithms.

### Summary
This paper presents Deep Variational Inference Symbolic Regression (DVISR), a Bayesian extension of Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR) that aims to approximate the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions. The idea of combining variational inference with neural-guided symbolic regression is novel and promising. However, the experimental evaluation is currently limited to simple, synthetic cases, which raises significant concerns about the method's scalability, practical utility, and advantages over existing approaches. The following points detail these concerns.

### Strengths
The core idea of formulating symbolic regression as a variational inference problem is a significant contribution. By redefining the training objective to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), the authors shift the goal from finding a single best-fit expression (as in DSR) to approximating the full posterior distribution over expressions.

### Weaknesses
**1. Lack of Evaluation on Standard Benchmarks and Real-World Data​**

The experimental validation is conducted exclusively on minimalistic synthetic datasets (e.g., y=x0**2, y=x0) with very small expression sizes (up to 10 tokens). The absence of tests on established symbolic regression benchmarks (e.g., SRBench, AI Feynman datasets) or any real-world datasets makes it impossible to assess the method's performance in practical, challenging scenarios. The claim of "demonstrating scaling properties" is not fully convincing without comparison to standard baselines on complex problems.

**​2. Insufficient Demonstration of Predictive Accuracy​**

The experiments successfully demonstrate that the learned variational distribution q_ϕ(f)converges to the true posterior p(f∣X,y)in controlled settings. However, symbolic regression is ultimately about finding accurate models for data. The paper fails to show that a higher posterior probability correlates with a higher fit accuracy (e.g., lower NMSE on a test set). Symbolic regression is a combinatorial optimization problem where local optimality (high probability under the policy) does not guarantee global optimality (the best-fitting expression). The evaluation should connect posterior probability to actual predictive performance.

​**3. Lack of Comparative and Ablative Analysis​**

As an extension of DSR, it is crucial to benchmark DVISR against DSR and other contemporary symbolic regression methods (e.g., GP, transformer-based approaches). The absence of such comparisons leaves the reader questioning the practical benefit of the proposed Bayesian framework.

Furthermore, the paper introduces two key modifications: a new reward function based on the ELBO and an enhanced network architecture (adding the previous token and constant values as input). An ablation study is necessary to disentangle the individual contribution of each modification to the overall performance. Without it, it is unclear which component drives any potential improvement.

**​4. Questionable Utility of Constant Prediction​**

DVISR introduces the prediction of constants within expressions, which dramatically expands the search space to be infinite. While the simple experiments show convergence of the posterior over expression trees q_ϕ(z), the paper does not adequately justify why this added complexity is beneficial. Does predicting constants alongside the expression structure lead to the discovery of more accurate or meaningful expressions compared to methods that optimize constants as a separate downstream step (like DSR)? The significant increase in search difficulty must be justified by a clear and demonstrated advantage.

### Summary
This paper introduces Deep Variational Inference Symbolic Regression (DVISR), a novel method that extends Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR) into a fully Bayesian framework. The key innovation is the reformulation of the training objective to maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), enabling the model to approximate the full posterior distribution over symbolic expressions rather than finding a single point estimate. The authors provide convincing evidence on small-scale, controlled problems that DVISR can successfully recover the true posterior distribution for both expression structure and constants.

### Strengths
The core strength of this work is its novel and well-motivated conceptual framework, which effectively combines the interpretability of symbolic regression with the uncertainty quantification of Bayesian inference, as a direct improvement of the DSR method. The theoretical grounding adds significant depth and credibility to the methodological claims.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness is the limited scale and scope of the experimental validation, which only demonstrates efficacy on very small synthetic problems with minimal expression complexity and no noise. The paper does not show that the method scales to problems of practical interest or performs competitively against existing symbolic regression algorithms on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, the comparison to related work, especially other Bayesian symbolic regression approaches, is relatively superficial.

### Questions
1. What is the core advantage of using Bayesian probability modeling? Can you summarize its key strengths?
2. Was any ablation study conducted to evaluate the contribution of the specific architectural change, such as providing the previous token as input?

### Summary
The paper extends DSR by replacing its heuristic reward with the ELBO, training the policy with REINFORCE so that maximizing reward corresponds to variational inference over expressions. It also has the network output distributions for constants, yielding posteriors over both trees and parameters. Experiments are toy-scale: tiny libraries and depths (with and without constants), where the authors can compute the evidence exactly (or via controlled quadrature) and show ELBO→log-evidence and KL→0; a scaling study shows degradation as maximum expression length grows.

### Strengths
Clear probabilistic objective. Casting the policy objective exactly as the ELBO (not risk-seeking) makes the optimization/probabilistic story coherent and checkable. 

Posteriors over constants and structures. The architecture outputs distributions for constants, so the method produces joint posteriors instead of doing separate constant fitting downstream. 

Positioning vs. VI literature. The paper distinguishes DVISR from earlier VI-style SR that were limited (polynomials only, partial parameter sets).

### Weaknesses
Novelty vs. prior neural-policy SR is limited. Using an RL-trained neural policy to sample expression tokens is well-trod (DSR/Neural-guided GP/PhySO/FEX). The paper’s main delta is the VI objective and constant distributions. Please delineate algorithmic differences and where VI yields tangible gains beyond conceptual neatness (e.g., better calibrated uncertainty, improved exploration, or sample efficiency), ideally with head-to-head ablations against DSR/PhySO/FEX/PySR.

No runtime/efficiency comparisons. Claims of amortization aren’t backed by wall-clock or budgeted comparisons. Add training time, sample counts, and hardware vs. DSR, PhySO, PySR, FEX on standard suites (Feynman, SRBench), and report accuracy/recovery vs. time curves.

Scaling limits left unresolved. The scaling study shows KL grows with expression size; the paper itself lists decreased performance as a key limitation. Provide architectural ablations (e.g., transformers or PPO/GRPO objectives the authors mention) and demonstrate whether they actually improve scaling on the same search spaces. 

Evaluation scope is narrow. Current tests are tiny and noiseless (except simple cases), with evidence computable only because the model space is tiny or integrals are defined carefully. Add real datasets (noisy data, physics with units) and report posterior calibration metrics (coverage, NLL, PIT histograms), not just convergence to an analytic posterior in toy settings. 

Use of priors not compared to alternatives. If structural/physical priors are used (even lightly), compare to grammar/units prior baselines and show contribution via +prior/−prior ablations.

Presentation gap: ELBO pieces vs. practical likelihood. The likelihood assumes fixed σ and i.i.d. Gaussian noise; real-world SR often needs heteroscedasticity/robust losses. Consider likelihood sensitivity ablations: different σ, Student-t, or learned noise heads, and show how the posterior shifts.

### Questions
Where is VI strictly better than risk-seeking/heuristic rewards? Provide a controlled comparison showing improved uncertainty calibration, exploration diversity, or sample efficiency when optimizing ELBO vs. a standard DSR-style reward. 

Runtime and budgets. What are the wall-clock times and numbers of sampled expressions to reach a given recovery/accuracy on Feynman or SRBench? Any evidence of amortization paying off vs. per-candidate constant fitting?

Posterior quality. Do you measure calibration (e.g., coverage at nominal levels) or report NLL/CRPS on held-out data? If not, please add.

Scaling mitigation. Of the proposed fixes (transformers, PPO/GRPO), which have you prototyped, and what empirical gains do they bring on the same scaling benchmark? 

Constants posterior expressivity. You currently use Gaussians; do mixtures/flows help capture multimodality without exploding variance-reduction needs? Any results? 

Evidence computation in “with constants.” The appendix adopts a special handling of integrals over constants not in a given tree. Please clarify the definition and numerics; can you validate it on slightly larger constant sets with importance sampling or nested quadrature? 

Comparisons to Bayesian SR (MCMC/EM). Include a Bayesian baseline (e.g., BSR/MCMC) on the exact same toy settings to show that VI reaches comparable posteriors much faster—or explain why not.
