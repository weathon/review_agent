## Abstract
Large language model (LLM) services are mostly centralized, causing inherent scalability bottlenecks and leaving substantial scattered GPU resources underutilized. Decentralized serving could potentially address these limitations, but impose challenges of **trust**, as the identity and behavior of participants cannot be reliably regularized, and **fairness**, i.e., how to maximize the benefit of all resource providers to improve engagement. However, existing decentralized frameworks **predominantly emphasize the rights and protections of users and the cooperative aspect among GPU providers** while **overlooking the inherent competitive dynamics**, imposing substantial constraints on GPU providers, such as requiring them to accept excessive platform-level oversight and to execute all assigned requests with fixed software stacks on fixed hardware configurations. We argue that such assumptions are unrealistic in real-world decentralized environments. To this end, we propose **WWW.Serve**, a decentralized framework for interconnecting LLM service worldwide. It preserves the flexibility of service providers, allowing them to decide **when, under what policies, and with what resources** they join the decentralized network, while further ensuring their anonymity. In terms of efficiency, WWW.Serve supports self-organizing request dispatch, enabling the network to autonomously allocate requests without centralized coordination. Three key designs are integrated: a blockchain-inspired credit system for trustless collaboration, gossip-driven peer synchronization for flexible participation, and a duel-and-judge mechanism for robust contributor evaluation. Empirically, we show that WWW.Serve incentivizes higher-quality services to obtain greater profit, while improving global SLO (service-level-objective) attainment by up to $1.5\times$ and lowers latency by 27.6\%. Its performance approaches, and in some cases surpasses, centralized scheduling, while fully preserving the benefits of decentralization. These results highlight WWW.Serve as a promising foundation for real-world, decentralized LLM serving.

### Summary
This paper presents WWW.Serve, a decentralized framework that interconnects LLM servers worldwide. It integrates three core design components that preserve service-provider anonymity and privacy while enabling self-organizing request dispatch, dynamic load balancing, and autonomous control over resources and policies. The work shows good originality and includes extensive experiments. However, the presentation quality is only fair, leaving several points that require revision or clarification; parts of the theoretical analysis lack rigor, and the novelty appears limited as currently presented.

### Strengths
1. There are originality merits in this paper.

2. The experimental evaluation is sufficient and comprehensive,.

### Weaknesses
1. While the topic is timely, the manuscript’s contribution is not clearly demonstrated. It largely reads as a combination of distributed learning, blockchain, and game theory without convincingly motivating gaps in prior work. The Introduction and Background sections do not explain why existing approaches are insufficient or how this work advances the state of the art.

2. The paper assumes a linear “win-probability–quality” mapping without derivation or parameterization from standard pairwise-comparison models; it overclaims convergence under replicator dynamics without Lyapunov or invariant-set analysis; key assumptions are not enumerated, results are not presented in theoremized form (i.e., Assumptions, Lemma/Proposition, Theorem and Proof), and parameter identifiability/sensitivity/robustness analyses are missing.

3. The presentation needs substantial editing; several passages are confusing or contain errors. Specific issues include:

a) Define Service Level Objective (SLO) on first use in the abstract.

b) Figure 1 and its caption are inconsistent: the caption states that the upper/lower panels show the workflow and the architecture, but the figure uses arrows to imply relationships among mixed elements. Consider splitting into separate figures.

c) The Figure 1 caption in §3.2 is unclear.

d) Several terms are undefined or used only once without explanation (e.g., “delegated requests,” “predefined threshold,” “gossip-driven”).

e) The contribution statement (line 83) lists three core mechanisms—credit-based transaction system, gossip-driven protocol, and duel-and-judge mechanism—but §4 clearly introduces only the first and third; the “gossip-driven protocol” is left undefined or uses terminology inconsistent with earlier text.

### Questions
1. Why is it named “WWW.Serve”? What does it have to do with what is presented and studied in this paper?

2. What does “delegated requests” mean (line 265)? 

3. What is the relation between Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism and the Dual-and-Judge mechanism?

4. What does gossip-driven mean in this context?

5. The discussion of “Executor selection and trust establishment” needs further clarification.

6 . The discussion of “Execution across heterogeneous backends” also needs further clarification.

### Summary
This paper proposes WWW.Serve a fully decentralized, multi-model LLM serving framework. The design combines (i) a blockchain-inspired credit ledger with staking to incentivize reliable service and enable tamper-resistant accounting, (ii) Proof-of-Stake–based selection for routing/assignment, and (iii) a duel-and-judge mechanism in which a small fraction of delegated requests are executed twice and peer-judged to continuously calibrate node reputation and quality. The implementation uses asynchronous messaging and supports heterogeneous backends and models. Empirically, across four heterogeneous settings, the decentralized scheduler consistently outperforms single-node service and closely matches (sometimes slightly surpasses) a centralized scheduler in SLO attainment, while also adapting to dynamic node joins/leaves.

### Strengths
1. It is an interesting attempt for decentralized LLM, for example, the credit ledger + staking design provides an auditable, tamper-resistant accounting path without a trusted coordinator; and the duel-and-judge procedure encourages high-quality service and penalizes poor or malicious behavior, avoiding privileged verification committees.

2. The paper provides an in-depth system design for decentralized LLM infra design, such as Asynchronous messaging (ZeroMQ ROUTER), backend-agnostic integration (e.g., SGLang/vLLM), and reproducible YAML configs.

### Weaknesses
1.  My major question is that the evaluation is limited in scale and uses a shared ledger instead of a full Credit Block Chain, leaving open questions about ledger consensus/throughput and communication overheads at 10²–10³ nodes. In real-world applications, such large scale communication overheads may be unavoidable. Strengthening Section B with either simulation or larger-scale measurements of ledger sync and gossip convergence would increase confidence. 

2.  To better position the work, adding at least one controlled, end-to-end comparison in an overlapping regime (shared model/backbone and request mix)is necessary, such as evaluation compared against Petals[1] (volunteer P2P collaborative inference for fixed LLMs), DeServe[2] (decentralized offline serving; reports 6.7×–12.6× throughput gains under high-latency networks), and/or GenTorrent[3] (overlay-based serving; reports >50% latency reduction vs. a non-overlay baseline).

### Questions
1. Under churn (joins/leaves), what are the per-transaction compute/bandwidth costs and the convergence times for both ledger synchronization and gossip when moving from the shared ledger used here to the full Credit Block Chain? Any preliminary numbers or simulations?

2. How do duel probability and #judges impact SLO attainment and tail latency (p95/p99)? A brief ablation quantifying overhead vs. quality-assurance benefit would be helpful.

### Summary
This paper introduces WWW.Serve, a decentralized framework for collaborative LLM serving. The goal is to address the limitations of centralized services, such as restricted scalability and privacy risks. The system interconnects distributed and anonymous LLM servers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling them to share computational resources and balance workloads. The core of WWW.Serve consists of three key mechanisms: (1) a blockchain-inspired credit system for trustless transactions, (2) a gossip-driven protocol for dynamic peer discovery and synchronization, and (3) a "duel-and-judge" mechanism to ensure service quality. The paper provides a game-theoretic analysis suggesting the system converges to a high-quality equilibrium and presents empirical results demonstrating WWW.Serve's performance.

### Strengths
- **Significant and Timely Problem**: The paper tackles a highly relevant real-world challenge in the age of LLMs. Building a decentralized, scalable, and privacy-preserving serving infrastructure could have a transformative impact on the field.
- **Comprehensive System Design**: The proposed WWW.Serve framework is well-thought-out, with its three core mechanisms working in concert to address the key challenges of trust, coordination, and quality control in a decentralized setting.
- **Theoretically-Grounded Analysis**: The inclusion of a game-theoretic analysis (Section 5) provides a theoretical foundation for the system's incentive structure, arguing for its convergence towards a high-quality service equilibrium.

### Weaknesses
**1. Idealized Evaluation vs. Real-World Complexity:** The experiments, while internally consistent, are conducted in a "laboratory" setting that abstracts away critical real-world challenges.

  - ***Scale***: The system is evaluated on a very small number of nodes (4-8). This is insufficient to validate the scalability of a P2P system named "WWW.Serve" or to reveal potential issues with the gossip protocol at scale.
  - ***Network Conditions***: The experiments appear to assume a high-bandwidth, low-latency network. Real-world systems must contend with geographic distribution, variable bandwidth, and network partitions. 
  - ***Simplified Economic and Operational Dynamics***: The game-theoretic model (Section 5) presumes nodes are rational actors with a static quality q_i, overlooking more sophisticated strategies and dynamics. Additionally, the paper has not dicussed the "cold-start" problem: How are initial credits distributed, and what mechanism bootstraps the network by attracting the first cohort of high-quality providers?

**2. Unacknowledged Overheads and Practicality:** The paper downplays the significant overhead of its core mechanisms.

  - The "duel-and-judge" mechanism is described as applying to a "small fraction" of requests (line 265), but the experiments use a 20% duel rate (line 448). This implies a substantial, non-trivial overhead, which is neither quantified nor justified.
  - Similarly, the performance impact of the "blockchain-inspired" ledger is glossed over. High-frequency transactions in a large-scale network could create a severe bottleneck, but the paper simplifies this by using a "shared ledger" in experiments (line 695-696).

**3. Potential for Re-Centralization:** The paper's own game-theoretic analysis hints at a potential paradox. Equation (1) (ṗ_i ∝ p_i(∆_i - ∆)) describes a "rich-get-richer" dynamic. While the authors frame this as "quality wins," it also implies that nodes with initial advantages (e.g., a large corporation with superior hardware and lower costs) will see their stake share grow exponentially, potentially leading to market concentration and defeating the very purpose of decentralization. This critical long-term dynamic and its negative implications are not discussed.

**4. Unresolved Privacy and Security Issues:** The paper claims to enhance privacy, but it primarily focuses on provider anonymity. It critically fails to address the glaring issue of user data privacy. Sending user prompts (which can be highly sensitive) in plaintext to anonymous, untrusted nodes is a major security risk. The framework lacks any mechanism to protect user data.

### Questions
Following up on the points raised in the Weaknesses:

1. Could the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the system's overhead? Specifically, what is the justification for the 20% duel rate, and what is its expected impact on overall system throughput and cost?
2. Regarding the game-theoretic analysis in Section 5, while it predicts convergence to high quality, doesn't Equation (1) also predict a strong market concentration dynamic ("rich-get-richer")?
3. The paper highlights "privacy" as a key benefit. What mechanisms are envisioned to protect sensitive user prompts when they are processed by anonymous, untrusted nodes in the network?
4. The experimental validation is conducted in an idealized setting. How would the system's performance, particularly the request routing and gossip protocol, be affected by real-world network conditions such as high inter-node latency and limited bandwidth?

### Summary
The paper introduces WWW.Serve, a fully decentralized framework for collaborative LLM serving that aims to overcome the scalability and privacy limitations of centralized services. It does this through 3 mechanisms: a blockchain-inspired credit system for trustless request delegation, a gossip-driven protocol for dynamic peer synchronization, and a duel-and-judge mechanism for robust contributor evaluation. Empirical results show improved SLO attainment, by up to 1.5× and reducing latency by 27.6%—while maintaining robustness under dynamic participation and preserving provider privacy.

### Strengths
1. The system provides a lot of flexibility to service providers allowing them to design their own scheduling and load balancing policies for their infrastructure. This will incentivize more providers to join the ecosystem while obscuring the details of the backend from the users - who will have the same experience as a centralized service where they upload their queries and receive the response. 

2. At the same time the credit-based transaction system and the duel-and-judge mechanism ensures that nodes cannot misreport their results or get away with producing quick but poor-quality responses. The authors show through both theoretical analysis and experiments that high quality nodes will accumulate stake share while low-quality node will be gradually phased out of the system.

### Weaknesses
1. The comparison with related works appears incomplete. I feel that for the list works (Kozgunovetal.,2024; Xianetal.,2024; Chenetal.,2025; Mia & Amini,2025) that explore secure, decentralized learning and inference frameworks, there should be an explicit statement on how well these works answer the 3 questions raised in the introduction, rather than a generic remark like, "overall, existing systems remain insufficient..."

2. It is not clear to me if the user has any say in which service provider manages their request. If they do not have a say in that then that is a drawback since many users may want to restrict their requests to certain service providers - especially due to privacy concerns and also due to variation in the scheduling policies of different providers.

3. The theoretical analysis only considers response quality and does not model the effect of high demand increasing the latency at the high performing nodes.

### Questions
1. Won't there be staleness in the information in the ledger since validation by peers will take time? And if there is staleness, won't that lead to incorrect scheduling?

2. Won't inference requests be blocked by requests for judging another node's response, thereby increasing the overall latency?

3. Can you provide an explanation/intuition for why the decentralized approach outperforms even the centralized one in some cases in Fig. 4?

4. The bars in Fig 5 are too thin, and it is difficult to understand what is going on in the plots. Please find an alternate way of representing those results.

5. Why does the Qwen 0.6B get the largest total number of requests in Fig 6?

6. What does 100% offloading in Section 6.4 mean? If all nodes offload everything, where does a request go? Also more generally, won't high offloading rates lead to requests being bounced around a lot and getting delayed because of that?
