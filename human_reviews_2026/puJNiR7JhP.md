# PlantRSR: A New Plant Dataset and Method for Reference-based Super-Resolution

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 6, 4, 6, 2

## Abstract
Single image super-resolution (SISR) often struggles to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) details from heavily degraded low-resolution (LR) inputs. Instead, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) methods offer an alternative solution to generate promising results using high-quality reference (Ref) images to guide reconstruction. However, existing RefSR datasets focus on limited scene types, primarily featuring
human activities and architectural scenes. Plant scenes exhibit complex textures and fine details, essential for advancing RefSR in natural and highly detailed scenes. To this end, we meticulously captured and manually selected high-quality images containing rich textures to construct a large-scale plant dataset, PlantRSR, comprising 16,585 HR–Ref pairs. The dataset captures the complexity and variability of plant scenes through extensive variations. In addition, we propose a novel RefSR method specifically designed to tackle the distinct challenges posed by plant imagery. It incorporates a Selective Key-Region Matching (SKRM) that selectively identifies and performs matching between LR and Ref images, focusing on distinctive botanical textures to improve matching efficiency. Additionally, a Texture-Guided Diffusion Module (TGDM) is proposed to refine LR textures by leveraging a diffusion process conditioned on the matched Ref textures. TGDM is effective in modeling irregular and fine textures, thereby facilitating more accurate SR results. The proposed method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on our PlantRSR dataset and other Benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper presents a new reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) method for plant imagery. Potential contributions are threefold:
(1) a large-scale PlantSR dataset for plant imagery,
(2) a Selective Key-Region Matching (SKRM) for efficient LR-Ref correspondence,
and (3) a Texture-Guided Diffusion Module (TGDM) that leverages a reference-texture-conditioned diffusion process for feature enhancement.
The method is evaluated on the new PlantRSR and existing general RefSR datasets, demonstrating competitive performance.

### Strengths
**Clarity and Reproducibility:**
The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. The inclusion of the source code strengthens the paper's credibility and reproducibility. However, it is important to release both code and data for full reproducibility.

**New Dataset:**
The efforts for constructing a large-scale dataset are appreciated. This RefSR dataset for plant imagery may enable new research about, e.g., agricultural and forestrial imaging techniques.


**Effective Method Designs:**
SKRM demonstrates balanced performance-efficiency, as evidenced by comparisons in Table 2 and Table 8 (Appendix). TGDM also shows clear advantages over existing fusion methods in Table 3.

### Weaknesses
**1. Dataset and Method Significance:**
The significance of introducing a large-scale and domain-specific dataset requires further establishment.

***(1) Downstream Impact:*** 
Demonstrating downstream applications (e.g., improved plant disease detection accuracy) of plant imagery super-resolution would significantly strengthen the practical value of this work.


***(2) Generalization:*** 
An important question is whether learning to address the challenges of RefSR in plant imagery leads to models to generalize. The authors are suggested to investigate whether a model trained (or fine-tuned) on this PlantSR dataset can achieve improved performance on existing non-plant RefSR datasets. This helps demonstrate a broader value of PlantSR towards developing more powerful RefSR approaches.


***(3) Dataset Split Rigor:***
The extremely high train-test split ratio (around 60:1) choice requires justification. A discussion on how the 100 test images were selected to represent the dataset's diversity and complexity is necessary for a reliable RefSR evaluation for plant imagery.


**2. Technical Novelty of TGDM and its Evaluation:**
While TGDM is claimed as one of the major contributions, its technical novelty is limited, as a combination of existing techniques, including the conditional diffusion process (Ho et al., 2020; Li et al. 2024), the Residual State Space Block (Gun et al., 2024), and the sub-pixel convolution (She et al. 2016).

***(1) Incomplete Ablation Study:***
The ablation study in Table 3 is incomplete. To evaluate its internal designs, a detailed ablation within the TGDM is required, including the Residual State Space Block and the sub-pixel convolution. Without this, the module feels like a black box where its true novelty remains unclear.


***(2) Marginal Gains vs. Computational Cost:***
The performance gain from the diffusion step appears marginal (e.g., +0.1PSNR and +0.0007SSIM). Given the well-known computational overhead of diffusion models, a clear analysis of the performance-efficiency trade-off is necessary to justify this choice. What is the additional inference time/FLOPs? Is there any significant visual improvement?


***(3) Unfair Comparisons to Diffusion Baselines***
The comparisons with diffusion-based methods in Table 9 (Appendix) are unfair, as those methods are not designed or trained for the RefSR task. A fair evaluation would require modifying and training these baselines with the same RefSR framework (using the reference images and the same losses). Without this, the evaluation on the diffusion step of TGDM is not informative.


**3. In-Depth Discussion on Limitation:**
The authors acknowledge performance degradations in processing dissimilar LR-Ref pairs, which is appreciated. To strengthen the depth of discussion, the authors are suggested to answer:
(1) To what extent of dissimilarity would the method fail? Would it be possible to use semantic feature distance to measure the dissimilarity and plot performance (PSNR/SSIM) against this metric? This may provide concrete insight into the operational boundaries of their method.

(2) To what extent of degradation would the method suffer when processing unmatched LR-Ref image pairs? Considering diffusion is used in this method, would it generate new and unwanted patterns?

**Justification for Recommendation** This paper presents a new dataset and a new RefSR method, with promising results. Meanwhile, the broader impact of the dataset and the novelty/necessity of TGDM require a more rigorous establishment. The core issue lies in reframing the contribution from "a good method for plant image RefSR" to "a dataset and method that advances the general understanding and capability of RefSR".

### Questions
**(1) Dataset Impact:** Beyond a new benchmark, can the authors demonstrate the practical impact of the proposed PlantSR dataset? For instance, does using the proposed RefSR method on this data lead to improved performance on a downstream task like plant species classification or disease detection?

**(2) Generalization:** Does training on this plant-specific dataset produce any generalizable knowledge? Please consider reporting results of a model (pre-trained or fine-tuned on PlantSR) evaluated on a standard, non-plant RefSR benchmark (e.g., CUFED5).

**(3) TGDM Novelty & Ablation:** Please provide an internal ablation study (e.g., removing the RSSB, and modifying the conditioning mechanism). Can the authors provide a runtime/FLOPs analysis to justify the cost-to-benefit ratio of the diffusion step inside TGDM?

**(4) Limitations:** Can the authors provide a more quantitative analysis of this method's limitations?

### Summary
Aiming at the problems that the existing reference super-resolution (REFRSR) data sets lack the coverage of plant scenes and the existing methods are difficult to deal with the complex texture of plants, this paper proposes a large-scale plant-specific REFRSR data set PlantRSR and the corresponding REFRSR method. PlantRSR contains 16,585 manually labeled HR-Ref image pairs, covering five real scene variations, such as color, scale and rotation, with a resolution range of 2K-8K, which fills the gap in the RefSR data set of plant scenes. The proposed method includes two core modules: selective key region matching (SKRM), which focuses on the key texture regions of plants to improve the matching efficiency; Texture-guided diffusion module (TGDM) refines low-resolution features through diffusion process with reference texture as the condition. Experiments show that the PSNR, SSIM and other indicators of this method are better than the existing SOTA method on data sets such as Planter SR and CUFED5, and the parameter quantity (11.1M) is more advantageous. More than 90% participants in user research prefer its visual results.

### Strengths
1.A large-scale RefSR data set specially for plant scenes is constructed, which solves the limitation of existing data sets focusing on human activities and architectural scenes. Manual annotation is used to generate semantically aligned HR-Ref patch pairs, which avoids the mismatch problem caused by automatic clipping, and covers a variety of real scene variations and meets the practical application requirements such as plant phenotype analysis.
2.It covers data set validity verification (comparing the model performance of different training sets), module ablation experiment (the individual contribution of SKRM/TGDM), cross-data set flooding test (CUFED5, WR-SR), diffusion method comparison and user research, and proves the superiority of the method and data set in multiple dimensions.
3.The parameters of the method are only 11.1M, which is much lower than those of RRSR(21.5M), MRefSR(23.7M) and other competitors, and the inference sampling step is only 4 steps, which balances the performance and deployment efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1. The specific coverage of plant species (including crops, wild plants and other different categories) and the differences in growth stages are not clearly stated, which may affect the generalization of the model to special plant types. The collection environment does not mention complex real scenes such as light change, pest pollution and so on, so the robustness of the data set needs to be supplemented.
2. The selection of key areas of the existing SKRM module depends on the texture difference threshold, and lacks the adaptive adjustment mechanism for low similarity scenes.
3. The diffusion sampling step (T=4) of TGDM is only determined by the performance saturation curve, and the effects of different sampling steps on different plant textures (such as fine veins and thick stems) are not analyzed.
4. The resolution of 80% images in PlantRSR is higher than 4K, but it is down-sampled due to hardware limitations, which fails to give full play to the detail value of ultra-high resolution images.

### Summary
This paper introduces PlantRSR, a large-scale reference-based super-resolution dataset specifically designed for plant images, and proposes a RefSR method that integrates Selective Key-Region Matching (SKRM) and a Texture-Guided Diffusion Module (TGDM). The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantRSR dataset as well as on other benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The PlantRSR dataset effectively addresses the lack of plant-specific scenes in current RefSR tasks, providing a high-quality and diverse supplement.

The manually constructed aligned patches successfully mitigate inaccurate alignment issues caused by automatic cropping in existing works, improving training quality.

The paper is well-organized with clear formatting and includes comprehensive figures and tables.

### Weaknesses
1.The evaluation datasets are somewhat limited. Beyond CUFED5 and PlantRSR, it is recommended to incorporate datasets from real retrieval scenarios (e.g., WR-SR or Sun80) to assess robustness under low-relevance reference images.

2.Diffusion-based approaches typically incur large computational overhead. Reporting inference time and memory consumption would help assess practical usability.

3.The paper lacks sensitivity analysis on sampling ratios or patch granularity, making the influence on generalization unclear.

4.Selective Key-Region Matching is conceptually similar to previous methods such as MASA.

5.Comparisons with diffusion-based large models (e.g., SinSR, DoSSR) are missing.

6.The details of texture injection in TGDM are insufficiently explained.

### Summary
The paper introduces PlantRSR, a large-scale dataset for reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) in plant imagery, containing high-resolution (HR) images paired with high-quality reference (Ref) images that capture the complexity of real-world plant scenes. Building on this dataset, the paper proposes a RefSR method leveraging a Selective Key-Region Matching (SKRM) module for efficient region-wise alignment between low-resolution (LR) and Ref images, and a Texture-Guided Diffusion Module (TGDM) that progressively refines LR features under reference-guided diffusion. Extensive experiments on PlantRSR and other RefSR benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in visual metrics of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper has a strong motivation and innovatively proposes the PlantRSR dataset, which presents high-fidelity imagery that captures the complexity and variability of real-world plant scenes. This dataset fills some gaps in the current RefSR datasets, which often lack diversity and realism in plant imagery.
2. The proposed SKRM module is effective, yielding the strongest overall performance; more importantly, it achieves the lowest computational cost among matching methods, making it both accurate and efficient.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The methodological novelty appears limited. The core two modules, SKRM and TGDM, bear resemblance to prior RefSR methods (region/patch matching and diffusion-based refinement). The changes seem incremental and not clearly differentiated by a new principle or theory. As currently presented, the modifications do not appear substantial enough to support a strong claim of innovation.
2. In Table 1, although the set of compared methods is fairly comprehensive, the improvements are quite limited. It is suggested to increase the super-resolution scale or introduce more discriminative metrics to better demonstrate the proposed method’s advantages. The ablation study in Table 3 exhibits similar issues.
3. The literature review is insufficient. The related work should include a more comprehensive discussion of recent RefSR methods based on diffusion models.
4. Please review the manuscript to avoid typo errors, for instance:(1) In table 4, "SOAT" should be corrected to "SOTA"; (2) In table 9, "LPISP" should be corrected to "LPIPS"; (3) In Figure 4, "PRefSR" should be corrected to "PlantRSR". (4) "SSMFT" should be corrected to "SSMTF".

### Questions
1. As the zoomed views in Figure 4 indicate, the proposed method achieves superior fidelity. Can this advantage be captured quantitatively by metrics?
2. In the PlantRSR dataset, are there specific categories of plants or scenes that are particularly challenging for RefSR?
