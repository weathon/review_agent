## Abstract
In this paper, we study a generalization of Markov games and pseudo-games that we call Markov pseudo-games, which like the former, captures time and uncertainty, and like the latter, allows for the players’ actions to determine the set of actions available to the other players. In the same vein as Arrow and Debreu, we intend for this model to be rich enough to encapsulate a broad mathematical framework for modeling economies. We then prove the existence of a game-theoretic equilibrium in our model, which in turn implies the existence of a general equilibrium in the corresponding economies. Finally, going beyond Arrow and Debreu, we introduce a solution method for Markov pseudo-games, and prove its polynomial-time convergence.

We then provide an application of Markov pseudo-games to infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies, a stochastic economic model that extends Radner’s stochastic exchange economy and Magill and Quinzii’s infinite horizon incomplete markets model. We show that under suitable assumptions, the solutions of any infinite horizon Markov exchange economy (i.e., recursive Radner equilibria—RRE) can be formulated as the solution to a concave Markov pseudo-game, thus establishing the existence of RRE, and providing first-order methods for approximating RRE. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practice by building the corresponding generative adversarial policy neural network, and using it to compute RRE in a variety of infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies.

### Summary
This paper investigates the Markov pseudo game and develops a first-order solution method with polynomial-time guarantees for the existence of equilibria. One key contribution is that the authors demonstrate recursive Radner equilibria in infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies can be reformulated as concave Markov pseudo-games (MPG). Once formulated as an MPG, new solution concepts can be applied to solve for equilibrium. Empirical results are provided via a GAN policy network representing players in an exchange economy, adapting the learning parameters via computation of recursive Radner equilibrium (RRE) via Alg. 1 (TTSSGDA).

### Strengths
This paper proves the existence of the generalized markov perfect equilibria(GMPE) for concave Markov pseudo game, which extending Arrow-Debreu's existence theorem. 

Based on a two-time scale stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm, they provided a algorithm for finding the approximate GMPEs. They further provided the convergence rate under this algorithm. 

The authors demonstrate recursive Radner equilibria in infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies can be reformulated as MPG and in consequence, proved the existence of recursive Radner equilibria

I also really like the scope of experiments and find them highly relevant - and I appreciate the authors motivations to address non-incremental problems.

### Weaknesses
Some of the critical assumptions are relegated to the appendix (e.g. line 79).

Despite being somewhat knowlegeable in Markov game theory - this paper is highly complex, and also subject to a lot of notational overload - for example in line 88 the definition for M, and line 310 the notation for I. I would really suggest being more concise with the notation and even some notational abuse where necessary to reduce the overload and convey meaning faster. I could only understand the scope of the contributions and what the ramifications of these contributions are, but I failed to get an intuitive grasp of the solution (proof) method overall nor been successful to follow through on the proofs entirely (although the sections I did review seem correct).

Therefore the result of my assessment hinges on hoping that in the rebuttal the authors could provide a simpler explanations to how they arrived at their conclusions.

### Questions
Does the statement in 164-166 regarding $\epsilon$-stationarity imply that no FPTAS solution exists for $\epsilon$-stationarity point in the MPG? Is this tight, or just a claim?

The fact that the reduction to RRE exhibits polynomial-time convergence guarantees are compelling - nevertheless could the authors be transparent about the limitations specifically w.r.t. this reduction?

### Summary
This work introduces the notion of *Markov pseudo-games*, an extension of Markov games where each agent's action space depends on the actions of other agents. The authors then introduce two solution concepts: GMPE and GNE. Under Assumption 3, the authors reformulate this problem as a min-max optimization problem. By further assuming the concavity with respect to the max-player, the paper proposes a two-timescale GDA algorithm that provably converge to an approximate stationary point. In Section 3, the authors show that infinite horizon Markov economy can be modeled as a Markov pseudo game and provide an existential proof of RRE, along with an algorithm that efficiently computes it.

### Strengths
- The framework the authors propose is novel. It is nice to see that the authors model a real-world economic scenario using their proposed framework.

- The paper extends the existential result of RRE in infinite horizon Markov exchange economies.

- The paper provides a provable efficient algorithm that converge to a GMPE in Markov pseudo-games and RRE in infinite horizon Markov exchange economies.

- Numerical results are provided where the authors model agents as deep learning neural networks, validating the theorems.

### Weaknesses
- The notations of this paper is quite dense and difficult to follow. Some notations are used before being properly defined (i.e. $D_{\varphi}(\pi)$ in line 158).

- One of the interesting feature of Markov pseudo-games is that each agent's action space depends on actions of other agents. However, Assumption 3 largely simplifies that the problem into a standard min-max optimization problem without any coupling dynamics. This assumption appears overly strong and undermines the main motivation of introducing Markov pseudo-games.

- From an optimization perspective, the problem reduces to a min-max optimization problem with hidden structures, which has been extensively studied in the optimization and game theory literature [1].

- Theorem 2.2 does not provide an explicit bound on the convergence time, making it difficult to compare the algorithm’s efficiency with other min-max optimization methods.

- Section 3 is heavily focused on economics, which may limit its appeal to the broader ICLR audience. I also suggest that the authors include additional background on Markov exchange markets in Section 3 to make the section more accessible to readers without an economics background.

### Summary
The paper introduces Markov Pseudo Games, a class of stochastic games that combine the standard Markov games and pseudo-games with the flexibility to capture dynamic uncertainty and action-dependent feasibility constraints. This class of games is particularly suitable for modeling infinite-horizon stochastic economies with incomplete markets, where agents face evolving uncertainty and limited strategic feasibility. The main contribution of the work is the proof of existence of a recursive Radner equilibrium within this generalized setting. Authors achieve this by reformulating the problem as a Generalized Markov Perfect Equilibrium (GMPE) of the corresponding Markov Pseudo Game, using a suitable exploitability function. Furthermore, a polynomial-time first-order solution approach is proposed that uses deep neural networks and minimax optimization; this enables an efficient computation of equilibria in high-dimensional, dynamic environments. Some computations are illustrated.

### Strengths
The paper considers a novel and challenging problem. Also, it has a good motivation. The proposed solution approach is also novel. The proposed formulation is particularly interesting, as it unifies infinite-horizon stochastic economies (relevant for macroeconomics area) with incomplete markets using a common theoretical model. The notion of recursive Radner equilibria in this framework is good; it offers an  understanding of the market dynamics. It seems that Roy Radner was not awarded a Noble Prize; while the broad area of general equilibrium seems important enough in econ literature that this sub-area had at least a couple of those awards. 

The work has a good theoretical rigor in my view; the theorems and proofs are carefully done. This is a good contribution to macroeconomic modelling. The reformulation of the problem as a Generalized Markov Perfect Equilibrium (GMPE) is a key contribution that allows the authors to effectively address challenges in prior literature. Furthermore, the paper opens promising directions for future research in economic theory and computational economics; this is possibly via deep reinforcement learning and economic equilibrium analysis.

### Weaknesses
The paper is primarily theoretical, with limited experimental validation. Thus, we have very limited view of the performance of the proposed approach across networks of varying sizes both in terms of the number of agents and the size of the state space. Hence, the important aspect of scalability and robustness remains underexplored.


There are many assumptions that are part of the paper’s analysis (to be expected in a theoretically oriented paper). For example, Assumption 6. But, it is deferred to the appendix. It is better to make the main paper self-contained by summarizing or at least highlighting such essential assumptions within the main text. Similarly, many theorems and results are presented with minimal discussion of their intuition or motivation. Including brief insights/intuition into the meaning and implications of these results would significantly improve the paper’s readability. In general, some discussion on the need or motivation for assumptions is needed. 

Similarly, some of the key definitions such as v^\pi  and u^\pi are currently given in the appendix, even though they are central quantities that are used throughout the paper. Bringing these definitions into the main text would enhance clarity and help readers follow the theoretical development more easily.

The polynomial-time convergence and approximation guarantees are built on regularity assumptions such as Lipschitz smoothness and bounded best-response mismatch coefficients. These conditions may not hold in many practical economic settings. A more detailed discussion of their limitations and how potential violations might impact convergence or solution quality would make the contribution more transparent and guide future research in this direction.

Finally, while the authors claim polynomial-time convergence to approximate equilibria, the paper provides limited information on approximation bounds or exploitability levels achievable in practice. The paper needs a clarification or acknowledgment  regarding any possible trade-off between computational effort and the quality of equilibrium approximation proposed in the paper; this would strengthen the practical relevance and interpretability of the results. Also, giving some background for those who are less familiar with the literature would enhance the readability.

### Questions
Apart from the key weaknesses mentioned above, some clarification and more discussion on the following points would be useful:

While the idea of infinite economies is theoretically sound and offers strong generalization, it is not very clear how the proposed theoretical results would scale when applied to large agent populations or more complex utility functions. Are there any known limitations or additional challenges that might arise in such scenarios? 

Most of the analysis rely on assumptions such as Lipschitz smoothness and bounded best-response mismatch coefficients. Also, the algo needs gradients of the rewards and transition probabilities. This seems to a strong requitement. Please clarify; if so, some discussion is needed. 

 What would happen if these assumptions were violated. For instance, if these regularity conditions do not hold, which may often be the case in real-world infinite economic settings, how would that affect convergence, stability, or the overall validity of the theoretical guarantees?

The computational experiments currently focus on linear and Cobb-Douglas utility functions, which are standard but relatively well-behaved. 

The plot of exploitability for the Cobb-Douglas seems to have not converged to zero during the reported horizon of the computation; some discussion is needed. 

Overall, to me it looks like the discussion about the computational results is very short and can be enhanced. 

Could the approach be extended to more general utility forms where these assumptions do not hold? Would such cases introduce potential stability challenges such as mode collapse or convergence failure, and if so, what mitigation strategies could be considered?

The computational architecture is generative-adversarial network (GANs) and they is known to be prone to issues like mode collapse; alternatives like W-GAN are prompted by such considerations. Some discussion on the possible mode collapse would help.  

It would strengthen the paper if the Authors could discuss the sensitivity of the results, particularly regarding the equilibrium convergence and approximation quality to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, or regularization coefficients.

### Summary
This paper introduces Markov pseudo-games (MPGs), a novel framework that unifies Markov games and pseudo-games to model dynamic, uncertain environments where agents’ feasible actions depend on others’ choices. The authors prove the existence of generalized Markov perfect equilibria (GMPE) in concave MPGs (Theorem 2.1), extending Arrow–Debreu’s pseudo-game existence theorem to dynamic settings. They further show that recursive Radner equilibria (RRE) in infinite-horizon stochastic exchange economies can be characterized as equilibria of certain MPGs (Theorem 3.1), thereby establishing the existence of equilibria in a broad class of infinite-horizon incomplete markets. Algorithmically, they propose a first-order exploitability-minimization method—implemented via a generative adversarial policy network (GAPNet)—that computes approximate equilibria in polynomial time under standard smoothness assumptions (Theorem 2.2).

### Strengths
1. The notion of Markov pseudo-games is conceptually elegant and unifies concepts in game theory and general equilibrium theory in a dynamic setting. The theoretical results are rigorous and intense, and build on a well-established foundation.
2. The mapping from recursive Radner equilibria to GMPE of MPGs appears novel, extending previous equilibrium existence results that were limited to representative-agent or finite-horizon settings. 
3. The application of deep multi-agent RL to macroeconomic equilibrium computation is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. Experiments are limited to synthetic, small-scale economies. The experimental section focuses on numerical metrics (exploitability, Bellman error) but lacks economic interpretation of the learned equilibria (e.g., consumption paths, asset prices, welfare implications). This limits the insight for economics audiences.
2. Notational issue:  $\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\pi})$ is used without giving definition, where $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ is the joint policy profile of $n$-agents. The only definition I found is given other player's policy $\boldsymbol{\pi}_{-i}$ the meaning of $\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\pi}\_{-i})$. Since the actions of the policies are mutually constrained in a pseudo-game setup, how does this further imply the definition of  $\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol{\pi})$?

### Questions
1. Can you provide examples of equilibrium behavior in the tested economies? This would help connect the mathematical constructs to economic meaning.
2. Can you explain more on the high-level intuition of how does the "pseudo game" aspect of the formulation affects or restricts the development of the entire theory?
