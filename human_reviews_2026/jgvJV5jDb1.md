# Partial Identification via Optimal Transport under Complex Constraints on Treatments and Potential Outcome Measures

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 2, 6, 4, 4, 6

## Abstract
We investigate causal effect estimation in settings where the potential outcomes under treatment and control are supported on \emph{distinct} measurable spaces, rendering classical estimands such as the average treatment effect ill-defined. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework for \emph{partial identification} based on optimal transport (OT), which quantifies the minimal expected cost required to couple the outcome distributions 
 and 
 across heterogeneous domains. Our first contribution is to establish valid partial identification bounds for this OT-based causal estimation and accommodate the inherent support mismatch between potential outcomes. Secondly, we extend our framework to incorporate covariate information, formulating a covariate-adjusted OT problem that yields tighter identification intervals by leveraging observed covariate distributions, and also extend to the designed-based experimental settings. Finally, through extensive simulations and empirical studies, we demonstrate the practical utility and robustness of our approach, highlighting its advantages over existing methods in scenarios involving heterogeneous outcome spaces and covariate structures. Our results provide a principled and flexible methodology for causal inference in complex settings where traditional assumptions do not hold.

### Summary
The authors propose a novel partial identification framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which quantifies the minimum cost of aligning outcome distributions across these heterogeneous domains. The main contributions include establishing valid identification bounds that account for support mismatch, extending the approach to incorporate covariate information for tighter bounds, and validating the method through simulations and empirical applications

### Strengths
- Partial identification is an important problem in causal inference, and recent work showed that Optimal Transport is a promising tool for this
- Extensive theoretical results (even though I have not checked their correctness carefully)

### Weaknesses
- My main concern is the applicability of the proposed method and how it fits into established partial identification literature. In causal inference, we usually specify a *causal query* of interest (e.g., a heterogeneous treatment effect) and then state assumptions/ restrictions on the DGP to ensure partial identifiability of this query and non-vacuous bounds (e.g., instrumental variables, or sensitivity models on the confounding strength). This paper starts by defining an optimal transport (OT) problem, without explaining much of the motivation or how this fits into established partial identification problems. For example, how is the cost function defined in practice? Can existing partial identification problems be cast into this formalism? At least for me this seems not obvious.
- The experiments are very limited. I understand that the main contribution is more theoretical, but it would be nice to see how robust the proposed method performs in different settings. I am also not able to find comparisons with baseline methods in the paper.
- The paper is hard to follow. Admittedly, I am not an expert in Optimal Transport, but I think the paper would benefit from a few examples and more intuitive explanations to make it accessible to a broader audience (especially for a venue like ICLR).

Minor:
- The authors talk about complex treatment arms, but then only study a classical multi-arm setting. I would remove "complex" here as this is usually used to denote unstructured treatments (e.g., text) in the literature.

### Questions
- What is the main motivation behind the setting? How can classical partial identification problems be framed as OT problems compatible with the setting in this paper?

### Summary
The authors propose an optimal-transport(OT)-based approach for partial identification under multi-arm treatments and structure-valued outcomes. They well formulate the OT to define the bounds on the between potential outcome distributions under such challenging setup. I will hold my overall rating, as the paper is not sufficiently clear or well-structured.

### Strengths
- The proposed estimator is technically sound: The estimator is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal.
- The authors extend the OT approach to the complex yet important setup under multi-arm treatment and structured outcomes.

### Weaknesses
(A) The assumed setup is unclear

It is not exactly clear why the authors claim that the point estimation is *fragile* . When reading Introduction, I believe that the authors consider partial identification problem, because they consider the setup where some standard assumptions for causal effect estimation (e.g., the causal sufficiency). However, Section 2 suddenly introduces the definition of causal bounds as the OT between joint potential outcome distributions, which is the authors' estimation target. 

1.  Please clearly illustrate the inference target and problem setup as soon as possible in Introduction. The reason why the authors consider partial identification is that the functional of joint potential outcome distribution can never be point-identified, due to the fundamental problem of causal inference (i.e., we can never jointly observe potential outcomes). Please clearly state this first by citing relevant papers.

> [2] Sergio Firpo and Geert Ridder. Partial identification of the treatment effect distribution and its functionals. Journal of Econometrics, 213(1):210–234, 2019.

The following descriptions in current introduction is very confusing.

> Partial identification provides a principled alternative to fragile point estimation when data, design, or structural constraints preclude full identification of causal effects

> Beyond binary contrasts, many interventions interact, overlap, or compete (Hudgens & Halloran, 2008; Flanagan et al., 2011; Woodcock & LaVange, 2017; Craig et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2023; D’Amour et al., 2021): multi-arm clinical options can share mechanisms while differing in delivery, and policy bundles often combine incentives and regulations whose effects comove

2. Please illustrate why such inference targets are important with real-world examples by moving Table 7 into the main text.


(B) Paper is not well structured

Overall, the paper is not well written. All tables displaying main experimental results are put in Appendix, meaning that readers cannot confirm empirical soundness without reading Appendix. Table 7 illustrating real-world motivation for inferring the functional of joint potential outcome distributions is also displayed in Appendix.

### Questions
# Possibility of another application example: algorithmic fairness

Some methods use the bounds on the functional of joint potential outcome distributions to achieve fairness in outcomes predicted by machine learning models (e.g., [1] for binary treatments)

Can the proposed OT bound be applied to such setups? The main setup difference from the examples in Table 7 is that potential outcomes are given by parameterized functions (i.e., predictive models) and the goal is to learn a fair and accurate models by minimizing the predicted loss while imposing a constraint on the bounds. 

If yes, it would be better to add such application examples to highlight the practical motivation of OT-based causal inference.

### Summary
This paper studies partial identification with complex constraints. Structured treatments and heterogeneous outcome spaces are considered, and an optimal transport method is proposed to address the challenges. Statistical properties of the method are analyzed, and experiments on benchmark datasets are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The structured treatments with complex constraints are considered.

2. The submission provides extensive theoretical analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. The submission considers the problem setting with heterogeneous outcome spaces. This setting is a bit artificial. Even though different treatments are conducted, why cannot measure the outcome in the same space? If different outcome spaces are considered, it is quite difficult to measure the causal effect even with given counterfactual results. 

2. In Section K, a transformation is performed from the space of $y_1$ to the space of $y_0$. However, it is case-specific and heuristic without a clear motivation. It is unclear how to design and evaluate a transformation function. 

3. Some technical details are missing, making it difficult to understand the algorithm.
For example, how to implement the function $g_a$ in Line 192?

4. For the variables $\pi$ in Line 192, the relationship between $\pi$ and the objective function is unclear. It seems that the variables $\pi$ does not appear in the functions $L$ and $\Delta_{multi}$.

5. The theoretical analysis and the algorithm are about to estimate the optimal transport. However, the analysis regarding the causal effect is missing. It would be better to further analyze the properties of the causal effect estimation.

6. It is interesting that leveraging the duality to avoid the huge space of multi-marginal transport. Nevertheless, the price could be the introduced multiple Lagrangian multipliers or functions. It would be better to compare the primal and dual, including the computational cost.

### Summary
The paper proposes a general optimal transport formulation for partial identification of causal effects in multi-arm treatment settings where each arm may have distinct outcome spaces. The approach introduces a mirror-relaxed multi-arm optimal transport problem that enforces per-arm conditional constraints, and encodes extra restrictions via a constraint set.
A Fenchel–Rockafellar duality is derived, and under smoothness and uniqueness assumptions, Hadamard differentiability and a root-n CLT for the plug-in dual estimator is shown.

### Strengths
The paper’s main strength is that it brings together existing ideas from optimal transport and partial identification in a unified framework for multi-arm causal settings. While the theoretical machinery itself is largely standard, the paper makes a useful effort to help broaden the adoption of OT methods in casual inference. The paper is presented clearly and gives good insights and intuitions where necessary.

### Weaknesses
1. (Presentation) The paper claims to bound causal estimands, but it never mentions how that estimand translates into the chosen OT cost and constraint set. A simple motivating example showing the bridge from an identified set for an estimand to an OT formulation would make things far clearer.

---
2. Duality and theoretical results appear largely classical. Theorem 1 (although I can see it is a starting point for the rest of the results) mirrors standard results from classical optimal transport and convex analysis. Likewise, the use of smoothing to obtain differentiability and a root-n CLT follows the standard approach in recent OT. Hence, the duality itself, and arguably much of the theory, does not seem genuinely novel. The paper would benefit from explicitly stating what, if anything, goes beyond classical results.

---
3. (Perhaps my strongest concern) The paper is advertized as being able to handle cases with potential outcomes with different measures. But this goes through mapping every potential outcome into a single common embedding. Choosing or validating embeddings that map heterogeneous outcomes into a common latent space can be quite complex. Pretty much everything relies (strictly) on this embedding. What happens if we choose a poor embedding $g$?

---
4. Although the paper claims to allow “complex experimental regimes,” the formulation of $\Gamma_{comp}$ only supports a small family of linear constraints. This is not conveyed clearly in the main text.

### Questions
Could you please clarify $\Gamma_{comp}$ can accommodate and what kinds of structures fall within its scope?

---
some typos and minor comments:

page 4: penality -> penalty

$\Gamma_{comp}=\emptyset$: Given the formulation of the feasible set on page 3, I believe this is not what you meant to say. Because the feasibility set is a subset of $\Gamma_{comp}$, and $\Gamma_{comp}$ cannot be empty. 

"objective in Section 3": I'd suggest using equation number instead.

page 7: recall that (D1, D2) be a split

### Summary
Summary
The paper develops a unified multi-arm partial identification (PI) framework based on Optimal Transport (OT), generalizing the mirror-relaxed conditional OT formulation of Lin et al. (2025). Specifically, it handles (i) competing treatment arms through a feasible set \Gamma_{\text{comp}} encoding mutual exclusivity and resource caps, and (ii) distinct outcome domains \{Y_a\} mapped to a common latent space Z via embeddings g_a:Y_a\!\to\!Z. The estimand is
\[
\Theta^{(K)}{L,\oplus}(\eta)
=\inf{\pi\in\Pi^{(K)}{\oplus}}
\E\pi\!\left[L(\{g_a(Y_a)\})+\eta\,\Delta_{\text{multi}}(\{X^{(a)}\})\right],
\]
which reduces to the two-arm mirror relaxation V_{\mathrm{ip}}(\eta) of Lin et al. when K=1 and \Gamma_{\text{comp}}=\emptyset. The authors establish Fenchel–Rockafellar strong duality for general nonlinear costs L,\Delta_{\text{multi}}, prove that the plug-in estimator is \sqrt{N}-consistent and asymptotically normal under smooth curvature, and give finite-sample bounds of order O(N^{-1/4}) matching the smooth-OT rates.

### Strengths
Strengths
	1.	Generalization and unification: Extends Lin et al. (2025)’s two-arm, covariate-aware mirror-relaxation to multi-arm and cross-domain settings with explicit design constraints.
	2.	Mathematical clarity: The multi-arm feasible set \Pi^{(K)}{\oplus} and the constraint system
\pi{X(a)}(dx)=u_a(x)P_X(dx),\quad\textstyle\sum_a u_a(x)\le1,
formally encode partial exposure and competition, an elegant measure-theoretic device.
	3.	Rigorous dual analysis: Derives a nonlinear Fenchel–Rockafellar dual with compact potential class U, yielding computationally tractable algorithms and uniform-in-iterate confidence bounds.
	4.	Statistical theory: Establishes CLT and finite-sample guarantees under smooth geometry, showing that the dimension d_X affects only variance, not convergence rate—an important strengthening of Lin et al.’s smooth-geometry results.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses
	1.	Causal interpretability: The connection between \Theta^{(K)}{L,\oplus}(\eta) and standard causal estimands (ATE, QTE) remains abstract; more discussion of how L and \Gamma{\text{comp}} translate to causal contrasts would help.
	2.	Notation overload: The presentation is mathematically heavy, and several definitions (e.g., mirror embeddings, competition kernels u_a) appear before full context.
	3.	Empirical validation: Simulations are largely illustrative; stronger applied comparisons (e.g., with COT-based or Lin et al.’s mirror-relaxed baselines) would enhance impact.
	4.	Practicality of tuning η: Theoretical dependence on η is clear, but empirical guidance or cross-validation strategy is lacking.

### Questions
1.	Can the authors clarify how the curvature constant \lambda in Theorem 2 scales with η? Lin et al. (2025) showed linear scaling under Gaussian geometry—does this persist in the multi-arm setting?
	2.	Is the dual approach numerically stable when Γ₍comp₎ binds strongly (i.e., when sub-probability marginals are small)?
	3.	Could the authors compare the finite-sample constants with those in Lin et al. (2025)’s Theorem 4.3 to quantify the cost of additional arms K>1?
	4.	In the MIMIC-III study, how are the embeddings g_a trained and does the resulting metric depend sensitively on their scaling?
