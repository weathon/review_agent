- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 4, 2, 4, 4, 6

## Abstract
Node homophily shift—the mismatch in the tendency of nodes to have neighbors with the same label between source and target graphs—poses a key challenge for \textit{Graph Domain Adaptation} (\textit{GDA}) without target labels. We introduce \textit{Progressive Structure Adjustment for Homophily Shift} (\textit{PSAHS}), which progressively reduces homophily discrepancies: in the source graph by modifying existing edges and adding new edges for low-homophily nodes, and in the target graph by making analogous adjustments for nodes with consistent label predictions from \textit{Graph Neural Networks} (\textit{GNNs}) and \textit{Multi-Layer Perceptrons} (\textit{MLPs}). After each refinement, GNNs are updated with domain-adversarial training for representation alignment. This interplay of structure adjustment and representation learning mitigates homophily shift, tightens the target error bound, and yields consistent improvements over strong baselines, highlighting the necessity of node homophily alignment for effective cross-graph transfer.

### Summary
The paper addresses node homophily shift in Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA), where the tendency of nodes to connect with same-label neighbors differs between source and target graphs. The authors propose PSAHS (Progressive Structure Adjustment for Homophily Shift), which iteratively adjusts graph structures to enhance source homophily and align target homophily distributions through pseudo-labels, combined with domain-adversarial representation alignment. The method is theoretically motivated by an error bound linking target performance to homophily shift.

### Strengths
* **Strong theoretical foundation**: The derivation of Theorem 3.1 establishes a clear connection between homophily shift and target error bounds, providing principled motivation for the proposed structural adjustment approach.

* **Comprehensive methodology**: The three-stage framework elegantly combines source homophily enhancement, target structure refinement using consistent GNN-MLP predictions, and representation alignment in a mutually reinforcing manner.

* **Consistent empirical improvements**: The method demonstrates substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (up to 21.94% on Blog dataset), with particularly strong performance under severe homophily mismatch scenarios.

### Weaknesses
* **Limited technical novelty in alignment component**: The domain-adversarial alignment loss follows standard DANN formulation without clear justification for why this specific choice is optimal. How does this compare theoretically and empirically to alternatives like MMD-based alignment used in GraphAlign? What are the trade-offs?

* **Insufficient analysis of baseline behavior**: Figure 2 shows intriguing differences in how StruRW, GraphAlign, and HGDA respond to fixed source vs. fixed target homophily scenarios, but the paper lacks explanation. Why does GraphAlign maintain relatively stable performance while HGDA shows dramatic degradation at certain homophily levels? Understanding these patterns would strengthen the contribution.

* **Computational complexity not addressed**: The iterative refinement process with repeated pseudo-label generation and structure adjustment likely incurs significant overhead compared to baselines, yet runtime analysis is absent.

* **Limited ablation on key design choices**: The choice of using GNN-MLP agreement for reliable node selection lacks thorough justification. How sensitive is performance to this threshold? What percentage of nodes typically qualify as "reliable"?

I would consider raising my score if the authors adequately address these concerns.

### Summary
This paper addresses a key challenge in Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA): node homophily shift, which refers to the discrepancy in the tendency of nodes to connect with same-labeled neighbors between source and target graphs. To tackle this, the authors introduce a novel framework named Progressive Structure Adjustment for Homophily Shift (PSAHS). The core contributions of this work are:
1.Motivation: The paper first derives a target domain error bound that explicitly decomposes the error into three main components: (1) the empirical source domain loss, (2) the discrepancy in homophily distributions across domains, and (3) the divergence in node representations.
2.Progressive Structure Adjustment: To minimize this error bound, PSAHS proactively refines the graph structures in both domains.
For the source graph, it enhances the homophily of low-homophily nodes by modifying and adding edges, thereby reducing the source domain error.
For the target graph, where labels are absent, it leverages consistent pseudo-labels generated by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to identify reliable nodes and performs similar adjustments to align its homophily distribution with that of the source.
3.Joint Learning Framework: The framework integrates this structure adjustment process with domain-adversarial training in an iterative manner. This creates a self-reinforcing loop that progressively mitigates homophily shift while aligning node representations.

### Strengths
1.Clear and Valuable Problem Formulation: The paper identifies a novel and significant problem in Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA): node homophily shift. It clearly articulates the limitations of prior work and effectively motivates the need to align homophily as a global structural property.

2.Novel and Well-Designed Methodology: The core idea—proactively adjusting graph structures to align homophily distributions—is highly novel. The strategy of using prediction consistency between a GNN (structure-aware) and an MLP (feature-aware) to generate reliable pseudo-labels for the target graph is particularly well-designed and effective.

3.Comprehensive and Convincing Experiments: The paper is supported by a strong experimental evaluation.
Synthetic data experiments directly validate the method's core hypothesis, showing its effectiveness under controlled homophily shifts.
Real-world benchmarks show consistent and significant performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, especially on challenging low-homophily graphs.
Ablation studies clearly demonstrate that each key component of the proposed framework is necessary and contributes to the final performance.

### Weaknesses
1.Scalability and Computational Cost: The iterative process of adding new edges can destroy graph sparsity, leading to significant computational and memory overhead for GNN training. This may limit the method's applicability to large-scale graphs. The paper lacks a formal complexity analysis or discussion on scalability.

2.Sensitivity to Hyperparameters: The method introduces several key hyperparameters (e.g., the homophily threshold h), and its performance appears sensitive to their tuning. The paper provides limited analysis on this aspect, leaving questions about the method's robustness and the general strategy for parameter selection on new datasets.

3.Risk of Error Propagation: The method's reliance on pseudo-labels for target graph adjustment is a significant risk. Inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to detrimental structural modifications, potentially creating a negative feedback loop where errors are amplified through subsequent training iterations.

### Questions
Q1:Could you provide a time and space complexity analysis for your method? How does adding new edges affect its scalability, especially on large graphs?

Q2:How did you select key hyperparameters, such as the threshold h? Are these settings robust across different datasets, or do they require careful tuning for each new task?

### Summary
This paper studies node homophily shift between source and target graphs in graph domain adaptation and proposes PSAHS, a progressive pipeline that (i) adjusts the source graph to raise low-node homophily, (ii) uses reliable pseudo-labels to adjust the target graph, and (iii) applies domain-adversarial representation alignment. The authors provide a PAC-Bayes bound linking target error to source error, homophily differences and feature discrepancy, and demonstrate empirical gains on synthetic and multiple real-world graph benchmarks.

### Strengths
Theoretical foundation. The paper presents a clear theoretical analysis that links an adjusted homophily notion to a target-domain generalization bound and motivates structure adjustment; this strengthens the conceptual grounding of the approach.

Empirical breadth. The authors evaluate on both synthetic settings (where homophily shift can be controlled) and several real datasets (Citation, Airport, Blog, Twitch). The synthetic experiments in particular help illustrate the method’s behavior under controlled homophily shifts, increasing the empirical credibility of the claims.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited and insufficiently differentiated novelty. The idea of learning or refining graph structures to improve transfer has been explored in prior work. For example, recent GDA work that explicitly constructs or exploits attribute graphs to raise homophily and to provide semantically meaningful edges appears closely related [1]. The authors should clearly and explicitly position PSAHS with respect to existing graph-structure learning for GDA.

[1] Fang, R., et al. (2025). On the benefits of attribute-driven graph domain adaptation. In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations.

2. Graph Structure Adjustment (Eq. (2)) is under-motivated and potentially impractical.

(a) It is unclear how much extra gain the proposed per-edge weighting and node-wise edge-adding scheme provides over much simpler alternatives (e.g., rebuild a k-NN graph on aggregated features); the authors should quantify the incremental benefit.

(b) Choosing the threshold $h$ is hard in practice. The method relies on a global homophily threshold to decide which nodes to adjust, but in realistic transfer settings, $h$ is difficult to choose from source labels alone; the paper should analyze sensitivity to $h$.

(c) Scalability and $\alpha_u$ interpretation. The node-specific parameter $\alpha_u$ is not clearly specified as fixed or learned; if it is per-node and free, this raises scalability and over-parameterization concerns—authors should clarify how $\alpha_u$ is set and discuss implications for large graphs.

3. Missing complexity and scalability analysis. The manuscript does not provide time/space complexity bounds or runtime/memory comparisons; given the potentially expensive neighbor selection and edge updates, the paper should include complexity analysis and discuss how to scale to much larger graphs.

4. Insufficient hyperparameter details for reproducibility. The current appendix gives only coarse grids. For reproducibility and fair comparison, the authors should provide the final per-dataset hyperparameter settings.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel method called Progressive Structure Adjustment for Homophily Shift (PSAHS), aimed at improving GDA by addressing node homophily shift—a crucial challenge in transferring knowledge between source and target graphs. The proposed framework adjusts the graph structure progressively, first enhancing homophily in the source domain, then aligning the homophily in the target domain, and finally refining both domains via adversarial training for representation alignment. The paper theoretically connects homophily shift to cross-domain error bounds and validates the approach through experiments, showing that PSAHS outperforms strong baselines, especially under severe homophily mismatch.

### Strengths
1. Innovative Approach to Homophily Shift – The idea of progressively adjusting graph structures to address node homophily shift is novel and provides a structured solution to an important problem in GDA.
2. Thorough empirical evidence of the method's effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets are provided, demonstrating significant improvements over established baselines. PSAHS is shown to perform particularly well in scenarios with large homophily mismatches, which are common in practical GDA problems.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing lacks clear logical flow, which makes the paper harder to follow at times. Additionally, the heavy use of notations without sufficient explanation can be confusing for readers. It would significantly improve readability if the authors provided a table or glossary to define and explain the various notations used throughout the paper. This would help readers better understand the technical details.
2. The figures used in the paper are not as clear or informative as they could be. Enhancing the visual presentation of key concepts, results, and experimental setups would make the paper more accessible and easier to interpret. Stronger, more intuitive figures would better convey the results and methodologies.
3. While the experiments demonstrate some improvements, the improvements over state-of-the-art baselines are relatively small, and the paper does not sufficiently explore more complex or real-world datasets where the method could show a more significant impact. More comprehensive and varied experimental evaluations would strengthen the paper’s claims.

### Questions
1. I do not have a clear understanding of the specific theoretical contributions of this paper. I hope the authors can clarify the purpose and significance of Section 3.1 during the rebuttal stage. I will reconsider the paper and adjust my score accordingly.

### Summary
The paper studies graph domain adaptation (GDA) under node homophily shift—the mismatch between the distributions of node-level homophily across source and target graphs. It proposes a SOTA gda architecture and their theory and observation get supported by previous research.

### Strengths
1. The manuscript is clearly written and well organized; notation is introduced cleanly, and figures/algorithms materially aid readability.

2. The evaluation spans a reasonably comprehensive set of datasets (synthetic and real-world) and shows consistent, meaningful gains over competitive baselines; ablations support the design choices.

3. The problem about "Node homophily shift between graph domain" is interesting and focused by many related works. I think this is a core problem of GDA.

### Weaknesses
1. The choice of hyperparameter seems to be central to both guarantees and performance; guidance is limited. Please include sensitivity analysis.

2. Repeated rewiring can be costly on large graphs. The paper would benefit from complexity analysis (per iteration) and wall-clock/runtime vs. accuracy plots. 

3. Please add some necessary assumption in the main theorem to clarify scope.
