# From Grunts to Lexicons: Emergent Language from Cooperative Foraging

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 4, 2, 2

## Abstract
Language is a powerful communicative and cognitive tool. It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.
Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication.
Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch.
We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language.
Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.

### Summary
This paper introduces a gridworld foraging environment as a testbed for emergent communication. The environment supports two tasks: one where a pair of agents communicates to retrieve the highest valued object, and one where they communicate to retrieve objects in their spawning order. The communication channel, over a vocabulary of 4 symbols, is separate from the action space. The authors find that communication indeed emerges between agents and exhibits many properties present in human language: compositionality, spatial or temporal markers (example of displacement), interchangeability, and cultural transmission.

### Strengths
I enjoyed reading this paper. I found it to contextualize well within the emergent communication literature, and to go above and beyond experimentally, exploring the interaction of many variables (population size, embodiment, bidirectional channel, compositionality, etc) that are usually explored separately. 

To me, **the highlight of the paper was the result on displacement**, which is nontrivial, and to the best of my knowledge, has not been shown before. I would definitely emphasize this finding (nothing wrong with the other findings, but they mostly confirm existing results). An interesting aspect of the spatial/temporal markers is that they are tied to **communicative need**, i.e., the fact that in Game II (where displacement emerges) time information was necessary to succeed at the game, whereas in Game I it was not. This ties well into theories that what gets lexicalized in language are things that are important to communicate about (cf. Gualdoni et al., 2024, Bickerton 2009).

Overall, I think the findings + environment are relevant to the emergent communication community, and I would recommend acceptance.

### Weaknesses
There were two main weaknesses, both of which affected my score. If both are addressed I will raise my score to an 8.

1. **Contextualizing results in literature**: Many of the results (except displacement) have been independently attested in the literature. For instance,
	1. Population size affects compositionality: shown in Rita et al., 2022. 
	2. Implicit communication can emerge when explicit communication is disabled: shown in Mordatch and Abbeel
   I'm missing a discussion of how your results compare to these existing ones. In many cases "This corroborates results in CITATION, who did X and found Y" is probably sufficient.

2. **In the theoretical appendix:** Assumption 1 is unrealistic due to agent capacity being relatively unconstrained (see Tucker et al., 2022 for an example where capacity is constrained). We can construct a situation where N agents are equally multilingual in N languages, such that the language distance is high but performance is not sacrificed. Since the theoretical results depend on Assumption 1, I strongly recommend to remove the theoretical portion entirely and rework it for a future standalone submission.

### Summary
The paper proposes to study emergent communication in a foraging environment. LSTM-based agents are placed into a 2D grid world where they are incentivized to cooperate and forage. The subject of interest is the communication protocol that emerges between the agents. The authors quantify the degree of compositional structure, to what extent agents speak a similar language, and argue why the setting of foraging is more representative of the emergence of language in our species, compared to referential games.

### Strengths
The paper is well motivated from the viewpoint of using this experimental setup for studying human language evolution.

The paper is well situated within the related literature.

The proposed framework of studying emergent communication in foraging games is compelling and conceptually intuitive.

The results give hints that this framework would lead to desirable phenomena to be reflected (e.g., population size effects).

The paper comes with a rich appendix, studying important factors such as vocabulary size and generalization to unseen positions.

### Weaknesses
Contribution. Foraging games / 2d grid worlds have been extensively studied in multi-agent reinforcement learning (as noted in the submitted version). I am surprised that this would be (as claimed) new to the field of emergent communication (?) My rating is based on the assumption that foraging was not studied in emergent (symbolic) communication before.

Baselines. The paper proposes a new experimental framework to study emergent communication. In this setting, a suitable baseline would be the standard referential game in order to compare the two. However, in its current form the paper lacks such a comparison.

Metrics. It has become a habit in the field of emergent communication that every paper uses topsim + some new ad-hoc defined metrics (since topsim is flawed by design). This paper at least re-uses one other metric than topsim – but again introduces new metrics. I would have preferred to see results for previously proposed metrics, e.g., the ones from Conklin & Smith (ICLR 2023) or Elmoznino et al. (ICML 2025).

Model architectures. Only LSTM-based agents are considered. While somewhat standard in the emergent communication literature, the findings would be more interesting if different architectures were considered, especially transformers.

### Questions
I noticed the main setup is designed to be cooperative and a non-cooperative version is reported in Appendix. However, the description there only ablates informativeness of messages through perturbation. Can you elaborate why this would implement a non-cooperative version of the game? It would be interesting to study e.g., deception, if communication was still functional but the game design would reward non-cooperative behavior.

Why does topsim decrease with an increase of vocabulary size?

### Summary
This paper introduces Foraging Games (FG). FG is a multi-agent 5x5 gridworld for studying Emergent Communication. Agents can move in a partially-observed two dimensional grid, communicate discrete tokens over a communication channel (a part of the action space), and collect objects towards accomplishing an objective. There are two types of objectives in the game (each yielding a different environment):
- ScoreG: Two objects are given different scores, each agent knows one of the scores, the agents must simultaneously pick up the higher-scoring object. The agents cannot see each other.
- TemporalG: Objects are spawned over time in one of the agents' field of view. Agents must pick up the objects on an agreed-upon order.

The authors study the learning dynamics and the emergent communication protocol. In particular, experiments examine the following questions:
1. Does an effective communication protocol emerge?
2. Is the communication protocol compositional? This is done by measuring topographical similarity between messages and meanings.
3. The effect of population size. Here population refers to the number of instantiations of the architecture, e.g. population size $15$ means that at every round of training two of fifteen NN instantiations are taken as the agent policies.
4. The effect of the social network structure. For example, Self-Play means letting an agent policy play with itself (a loop in the network), a ring network means letting the $i$th player play with the $i + 1 mod N$ player, where $N$ is the population size. In addition, rings-with-cliques and a Watts-Strogatz networks are examined. In particular, the effect of the network structure on the ability of agents to generalize to new players (zero shot coordination).
5. What happens when the communication channel is turned off so that agents communicate purely through their actions.

### Strengths
- The investigation of network structure on properties of the emergent communication protocol are novel and very interesting in my opinion. I think this is the main contribution of the paper, and would suggest reframing the paper around it considering that many of the other ideas are not novel (see Weaknesses).
- The paper is well-situated in a growing body of literature on emergent communication. In particular, the game is similar to the setting of Mordatch and Abbeel (2017) which was a seminal work in the field.
- There is a rich and interesting collection of ablations.
- The various settings are generally well-presented. I was able to understand what the experimental setup and results easily.

### Weaknesses
- The Foraging Game setup is very similar to the setup explored by Mordatch and Abbeel (2017), in what is a foundational work in emergent communication. This was the first (or among the first) papers to study embodied emergent communication, specifically with agents moving on a (continuous) two dimensional world, without seeing each other, in order to reach landmarks (equiv. pick up objects) at a certain order. That paper explicitly studied compositionality. None of this is mentioned in the paper, which is the main reason for my presentation score (contextualization relative to prior work). Presenting this paper as a follow-up to Mordatch and Abbeel would be more honest with respect to originality; considering the impact of the 2017 paper, it would only strengthen this paper.
- The ablation on "Implicit Communication" is essentially changing the Emergent Communication setup to a Social Learning one (Ndousse et al., 2021 and several other papers around that time by Natasha Jaques). In MARL social learning, the question is whether agents learn from each other by observing each others' actions. The connection should be made explicit.
- The paper neglects to mention the rich body of literature on embodied emergent communication, indeed starting from Mordatch and Abbeel. In particular, the second paragraph in the introduction seems to imply that the study of embodied emergent communication is novel to this paper; that is far from the case.
- More broadly, the title, introduction and conclusion of the paper suggest that the paper has ramifications to the study of the evolution of language. The question of whether results emergent communication have meaning for natural language is a topic for heated debate [e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular [1] argues that following Hockett's design feature (such as displacement, emphasized in this paper) do not necessarily bear significance for language evolution. This is the reason for my soundness score. I suggest instead that the authors reframe their paper as bearing meaning on training dynamics of MARL, rather than overpromising and underevaluating as a paper on natural language evolution.
- Minor: Citation styles are in the wrong format in most of the paper. Use citep instead of citet. The experiment shorthand notation (e.g. P3-FC-XP) is not helpful, because as a reader I am not familiar with the many acronyms.

### Questions
- What is the "semantic space" used for measuring topographical similarity?
- Besides using a discrete state and action space, are there other significant ways in which Foraging Games differ from Mordatch and Abbeel's grounded communication environment?

### Summary
This paper introduces the Foraging Games framework within a MARL setting to study the emergence of language under specific ecological constraints, including embodiment, partial observability, and the need for temporal reasoning. The authors successfully demonstrate that the resultant communication protocol exhibits key linguistic properties The work provides empirical evidence on how environment-driven constraints can lead to the emergence of specific language functions. While the study is technically sound and achieves its specific goals, the choice of research paradigm in the current AI landscape raises significant questions about its overall significance and generalizability.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of the Foraging Games (FG)  effectively integrates ecological constraints such as partial observability and the necessity of temporal reasoning. This moves beyond traditional, more static RefGame and offers a more ecologically valid setting for studying language origins.

2. The paper provides clear evidence for the emergence of both Interchangeability, arbitrariness, compositionality, cultrual transmission and, more notably, Displacement—the ability to refer to non-present facts (past events). This is a strong result supporting the hypothesis that temporal demands drive linguistic complexity.

### Weaknesses
Fundamental Critique on Research Significance and Paradigm: 
This is the most critical weakness. The research paradigm employed—utilizing small LSTM models in a highly simplified, "toy" $5 \times 5$ environment—appears to be meaningless. In the age of LLMs which have demonstrated scalable compositionality and robust generalization, the conclusions drawn from this limited setting face major challenges in terms of relevance and transferability. This work provides little inspiration for improving algorithms used in modern LLMs or complex MARL systems. It is also inadequate for providing insights of evolutionary linguistics: The small population size ($N \le 15$) and limited training time are insufficient to simulate the long-term cultural transmission and evolutionary pressures necessary for drawing rigorous conclusions.

(1)  Limitations of Embodiment and Population ScaleWeak Embodiment: The $5 \times 5$ grid world is too simplistic to qualify as true embodiment. The task primarily constitutes a simplified partially observable planning problem, lacking the challenges of high-dimensional perception, complex motor control, and detailed physical interaction that define true embodied AI. This simplification limits the ability to observe how genuine physical constraints shape complex syntax.

(2) Insufficient Population Scale: The tiny population size ($N \le 15$) restricts the derived "language" to an arbitrary convention among a few agents, not a robust, social-driven language system. Conclusions regarding linguistic structure and robustness are fundamentally limited by the absence of the social pressure and generational learning required for large-scale conventionalization.

(3) Questionable Emergence of Displacement: The claim of emergent displacement is weakened by the possibility of explicit encoding, illustrated in Figure2. 

(4) Limited Generalization and Structural Robustness Poor Generalization to Unseen Locations: The significant drop in success rate when generalizing to unseen object locations (e.g., 0.953 to 0.756 in ScoreG, as noted in the Appendix) suggests a failure to learn an abstract, coordinate-independent spatial reference grammar.

### Questions
Contemporary Significance: Given the current landscape of LLMs and large-scale MARL, what is the non-trivial research significance of studying EC in $5 \times 5$ grid worlds today? How do the specific architectural or algorithmic insights here transfer to models operating in high-dimensional, open-world settings?

Memory Structure and Displacement: Please clarify the exact architecture and input encoding of the agent's memory module ($M_t$). To what extent is temporal or spatial information explicitly encoded or tagged in the input observation ($O_t$) before it enters the RNN/GRU? This is crucial for verifying the genuine emergence of displacement versus a simple mapping/retrieval from a pre-structured memory.
