# Effector Complexity Enhances Transfer Learning

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 2, 0, 2, 4

## Abstract
Both biological and artificial embodied systems rely on effectors to interact with the world. How does this embodiment impact the way they learn? The role of embodiment in shaping learning dynamics is not well understood from a neuroscience or a machine learning perspective. In this study, we treat embodiment as a variable in artificial agents and study how changes in effector complexity reshape the dynamics of learning. Our hypothesis is that more complex effectors provide constraints that yield better transfer learning on new tasks, despite simultaneously posing a more complex control problem. We evaluated this hypothesis on area under the performance curve, and use time to sustained performance plateau as a parameter for task difficulty. Our results show that while a simpler effector excels when trained from scratch, a more complex effector yields superior performance after pre-training on another task. We further demonstrate that the improvement gained from transfer learning is greater for the complex effector. Our findings suggest that embodiment plays an important role in enabling efficient transfer, offering insights into the differences in learning dynamics between disembodied artificial systems and their biological counterparts.

### Summary
The paper aims to study the effect of embodiment complexity and the transfer learning efficiency, hypothesizing that a complex effector provides constraints that lead to better transfer learning. They compare two effectors with different complexity, point mass and arm, and study their transfer learning efficiency on a family of 2D reaching tasks. They use AUC as a major metric to compare the transfer learning efficiency between the tasks.

### Strengths
While I am not an expert, the role of embodiment in learning seems to be an overlooked research field that can potentially lead to a lot of interesting discoveries. Particularly, their hypothesis on the complexity of the effector to transfer learning efficiency sounds like an interesting direction.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited validation.

The main hypothesis that the authors claim to test is whether the effector complexity provides constraints that yield better transfer learning on new tasks [line 17-18]. I am not convinced that the current experiments are enough to validate the hypothesis. 
1) The only compared effectors are two kinds. 
I am not suggesting that the authors should look at all types of possible effectors, but I think two is too small a number for the main control variables. Furthermore, it intuitively makes sense that the arm would be a more complex effector, but there is no quantitative measurement of complexity suggested. Since they are comparing only two effectors, it is not convincing yet if these are generalizable results across different effects. Currently, there is only a very qualitative observation across two control variables, that 'arm effector' shows higher transfer efficiency than 'point mass' effector. I think there should be more experiments to draw a conclusion that 'effector complexity' causes better transfer learning. 

2) ...'provides constraints that yield better transfer learning' is not validated. 
The authors only provide the comparison of performance metrics between two effector types; there is no evidence that this is because the complex effector provides more beneficial constraints.
 

2. Choice of Metrics.
The authors propose two metrics for analyzing 'learning dynamics': 1) Time to Plateau (TTP) and 2) AUC, which are based on performance measurement of the fraction of time spent in the target zone. The writing does not fully justify the choice of those specific metrics and for example, TTP has multiple hyperparameters of choice (epsilon, delta thresholds) and the authors did not mention the effect or stability of the metrics across the hyperparameter choices. 

The authors heavily use AUC metrics, but this metric does not take into account the final accuracy. That is, one model can have a higher AUC but lower final accuracy, and in this case, only looking at AUC won't give a precise comparison of the transfer learning effect. 

I think the term 'learning dynamics' is misused because the authors are only measuring efficiency or learning time, rather than other aspects that comprise 'learning dynamics'.   


 

3. Interpretation/communication of results

There are a few points that I do not agree with the author's interpretation and explanations that cause confusion. In section 3.1, there are many parts where the authors use the aggregated term 'performance', but I think it needs a clear distinction between AUC (a proxy measure of learning efficiency) and final performance. 

In lines [429-431], the authors claim PM shows negligible/negative transfer, while the ARm model consistently maintains positive transfer. However, this is not true according to Figure 6, as there are tasks where Arm shows negative transfers.

### Questions
1. Where is TTP or a measure of task difficulty used?
2. I don't think the experiments were done over multiple seeds?
3. Is the choice of metric (fraction of the time target zone) conventional? What is the justification for this particular metric? Is there any alternative?
4. Could you compare final accuracy, not only AUC, on the transfer task?
5. What drives the observed effect?
The authors only perform validation on purely behavioral and performance-centered metrics. I wonder if authors have looked at the change of representation caused by the effector complexity and how it interacts with the transfer learning task.  
I do acknowledge this might not be within the scope of the project, but nevertheless, I believe future work to extend the analysis into a representational level or more quantitative evidence on how affector complexity actually leads to helpful constraint will improve the contribution of the paper significantly. This is a mere suggestion and question out of curiosity, and this is not the main reason for my scoring.

### Summary
The paper attempt to study the role of embodiment complexity on transfer learning in embodied control tasks. For that a study is designed with 2 different embodiments, a point mass and a 2 link arm and a study is performed on the transfer learning properties of the learned controllers when varying the tasks. The authors propose using the performance area under the curve to compare the different instances. They study their hypotheses using 6 different simulated reaching tasks. The main outcome of the study is twofolds, 1) simpler embodiment leads to favorable learning properties 2) more complex embodiments allow better transfer across tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written 
- The topic is very interesting, understanding the role of embodiment complexity in task transfer learning can have a huge impact on embodied intelligence
- the results are interesting

### Weaknesses
- It is unclear what method was used to learn the controllers
- The experimental setup is very problematic. With only 2 embodiments and one single learning method, the results are not meaningful at all and are hard to map back to specific cause. There are multiple factors that could be leading to this result, such as the choice of the learning algorithm, or the size of the neural network controller. To properly validate the authors' hypotheses a way larger study is required. The least required change is to have a larger number of embodiments, and different learning methods should be studied.
- Given the previously mentioned flaws in the experiment design, setup, and scale, the claims of the paper are wild.

### Questions
- can the authors elaborate on the intuition behind their hypothesis that more complex embodiments should have favorable properties in transfer learning? one could easily make the argument that for artificial systems, let's say a neural network controller, the more complex the embodiment the more prone the network is to overfitting and hence transfer is worse...

### Summary
This paper investigates how different embodiments of end effectors affect transfer learning abilities. The paper compares a point end effector and an arm across 6 different tasks  The paper hypothesizes that more complex embodiments improve transfer learning abilities and show results indicating that this might be the case

### Strengths
The paper poses an interesting hypothesis that could have important implications in robotics and transfer learning. The authors test their hypothesis across 6 different tasks and show consistent results across these 6 tasks.

### Weaknesses
It would be helpful to average figure 2 across all tasks. This would make the advantage of the transfer model more apparent.
The authors never stated that this was done in simulation. It would be useful to state this up front.
Fig 3 could be more clearly labeled. what is the orange circle? where does the robot start?
I would have thought that the arm would take longer to train considering the multiple degrees of freedom - seems like there is little difference. Could the authors comment on this?
How many seeds was this evaluated over?
Fig 4 should show standard error . Also its unclear what the red/orange bar means on fig 4 g

### Questions
The biggest issue with the paper is that it is not clear if the results were produced for multiple multiple trials (e.g., multiple random seeds) and as such i am not convince of the significance of the results. The authors state that these gains are all statistically significant but do not discuss statistical tests or include p values anywhere in the main paper. 


To better support the hypothesis put forward in this paper, i would like to see results across several simple and several complex embodiments. Only one of each type of embodiment isn't enough to suggest that this finding is true for the reasons hypothesized. It could be do to other factors unrelated to complexity. If this could be done, I would be willing to raise my score.

### Summary
The paper asks whether the body an agent controls, its effector, shape how well it can transfer knowledge across tasks? Using differentiable biomechanical simulators (Motornet) and GRU-based policies trained with supervised, differentiable control (not RL), the authors compare a simple 2‑D point mass with four “muscles” to a more complex two‑link, six‑muscle arm across six reaching tasks. From-scratch learning favors the simple effector, but after pretraining on a different task, the complex arm gains more from transfer and sometimes surpasses the point mass in absolute performance.

### Strengths
- Clear experimental question and setup. The paper isolates effector complexity as a variable and holds policy architecture largely constant. The training protocol, base model, fine‑tune on target vs. train from scratch is well illustrated (Fig. 2, p. 3).

- The finding that the complex arm benefits more from transfer and can outperform the simpler effector after transfer on several tasks, is interesting.

### Weaknesses
- The study’s comparison is restricted to a single embodiment pair; a simple 2‑D point mass actuated by four “muscles” versus a two‑link arm with six muscles without alternative “complex” bodies. Accordingly, the claim that effector complexity enhances transfer would be more robust if the same pattern were replicated across a morphology ladder (e.g., increasing links, actuator counts, or compliance)

- Task budgets and settings vary widely (e.g., 35k epochs for COBFGR and DCOR with different lrs/batch sizes vs. 5k elsewhere). This complicates cross‑task difficulty comparisons (Fig. 7, left) and AUC magnitudes. A control with matched budgets would strengthen claims.

- Loss‑term ablations are missing. Training uses substantial hidden‑activity and muscle‑activation regularization. Without ablations, it remains unclear whether these regularizers, not morphology, explain the arm’s transfer advantage.
