# Interpolation-Based Conditioning of Flow Matching Models for Bioisosteric Ligand Design

- Decision: Accept (Poster)
- Scores: 4, 6, 6, 2, 2

## Abstract
Fast, unconditional 3D generative models can now produce high-quality molecules, but adapting them for specific design tasks often requires costly retraining. To address this, we introduce Interpolate-Integrate and Replacement Guidance, two training-free, inference-time conditioning strategies that provide control over E(3)-equivariant flow-matching models. 
Our methods generate bioisosteric 3D molecules by conditioning on seed ligands or fragment sets to preserve key determinants like shape and pharmacophore patterns, without requiring the original fragment atoms to be present. We demonstrate their effectiveness on three drug-relevant tasks: natural product ligand hopping, bioisosteric fragment merging, and pharmacophore merging.

### Summary
The authors introduce two training-free interpolation strategies that mix known reference target data into flow-matching molecular generators based on SemlaFlow. They either interpolate between the generated sample and the reference partway through FM integration, or hold parts of the reference data fixed during the integration process. This is proposed to enable scaffold hopping, bioisosteric replacement, and pharmacophore matching by incorporating information from known binders into the generation process. The approach is compared to several recent methods—MolSnapper, DiffSBDD, and perhaps most appropriately ShEPhERD—showing improved SA scores and pharmacophoric similarities/docking scores on experiments covering some intended use cases. There are details of the evaluation that appear to be missing, which makes it difficult to fully assess how the method works. Overall, it is quite a simple idea and appears to work well.

### Strengths
The idea is very simple and easily explained, and the paper is clearly presented.

The ability to merge across many reference pharmacophoric features in a scalable way is useful, even if in practice this is achieved by random subsampling.

The authors report superior results to ShEPhERD, a considerably more complicated method, on several shared tasks.

### Weaknesses
A lot of emphasis is placed on SA scores, but this method does nothing to directly control SA relative to other methods as I can see. Presumably, the improvements here are due to better characteristics of the base model (SemlaFlow), so comparisons along this axis are not particularly convincing. The method shows quite low validity, especially compared to the baseline SemlaFlow. The authors are quite loose with the definition of a pharmacophore; interpolate-integrate seems more like enforcing global similarity to the reference molecule rather than specifically matching pharmacophoric features. Regarding the “dense” pharmacophoric features in the NP problem, it seems dubious that retaining all atomic features of input molecules is useful in practice. In general, a specific set of interactions or features govern the ligand–target interaction, not all features of the ligand, as implied in the second two experiments.

### Questions
Why is validity generally much lower in the second two experiments than in the first or in the ablation?

All methods produce chemical graphs with extremely low similarity to the reference (Figure 7), despite injecting the NP structure. Why? 

How does this compare to samples from the unperturbed SemlaFlow?

It is odd to report only Vina scores and not pharmacophoric similarity (to the target) in the bioisosteric fragment matching and SARS-CoV examples, given that pharmacophore matching is the explicit target.

It would be useful to report SMILES uniqueness for successes in each method in the experiments as well. In general, the chemical diversity of the successful identifications is not quantified.

Inpainting experiment (Table 11): the description lacks detail. Can the authors explain how this was implemented? Also, the only metrics for inpainting relate to validity, not SC similarity as in other experiments.

How were pharmacophoric features defined? Is this based on RDKit shape and color similarity? In the appendix it states: “Molecules were selected based on pharmacophore similarity ..., and each recovered reference pharmacophore feature was matched within a 1.5 Å threshold.” The definition of “hydrogen bond donors (HBD), acceptors (HBA), and aromatic centres” is not precise—how is this determined? Additionally, this is a short and somewhat arbitrary list.

It seems important to provide some indication of the quality of the geometries pre-relaxation, as xTB will resolve many issues.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present two novel, training-free conditioning strategies (1) Interpolate–Integrate and (2) Replacement Guidance that enable controllable 3D molecular generation using pre-trained E(3)-equivariant flow-matching models. The authors target ligand-based drug design scenarios, where protein structures are unavailable, and the goal is to generate new molecules that preserve key pharmacophoric and shape features of known ligands or fragments.
The framework is evaluated on three meaningful and representative LBDD tasks natural product ligand hopping, bioisosteric fragment merging, and pharmacophore merging, showing improved validity, synthetic accessibility, and diversity over specialized baselines.

### Strengths
The presented manuscripts tackles a key area in 3D generative drug design and present an elegant solution synthetic library search and fragment merging. The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The experiments conducted sufficiently demonstrate the key claims though some additional experiments can further help elucidate the strengths of the 2 methods.

### Weaknesses
- In table 1, Since the success rate is low, it would be transparent to see top-100 and top-1000 when possible as well to see how fast the similarity declines.
- P7, L325, which are these "key pharmaphoric features"? It should be specified or referenced. 
- In fig 1, please also note the pharmacophoric similarity to the corresponding NP. Some reported molecules especially for NP3 appear to be significant simplification of NP3 and may lack the same pharmacological effect.

### Questions
it is unclear to me how pharmacophore merging is different from biosteric fragmetn merging. It appears that in both cases the fragments from fraglysis program are replaced and merged to produce a functionally similar synthetic molecule. Can the authors elaborate and explain on this point?

### Summary
This paper explores how to design bioisosteres using the pre-trained SemlaFlow model—a 3D unconditional molecular generator that jointly designs molecular graphs and 3D conformers—without requiring fine-tuning. While prior attempts at bioisosteric design exist, they often neglect 3D conformational information, which is crucial for drug design (2d-based design). In contrast, the authors demonstrate that their methods can successfully design bioisosteric ligands under 3D constraints.

The authors propose two inference-time conditioning strategies: Interpolate-Integrate (resampling) and Replacement Guidance (fragment-conditioned generation). These methods appear quite simple yet are intuitive and robust. The authors validate their framework across serveral drug design tasks, including fragment merging and pharmacophore-guided design, which are important in drug discovery campaigns. Moreover, the results for natural product ligand hopping are interesting.

However, I have some concerns, and I would like to increase my score based on the response.

**The usage of LLM**: I wrote the entire review myself and only used the LLM to correct the grammar and improve readability.

### Strengths
- **Practicality of Training-Free Conditioning**: The paper's primary strength is its proposal of two training-free strategie. This inference-time approach is highly practical as it enables goal-directed generation using unconditional generative models (or foundation model) without costly retraining.

- **Effective 3D-Native Bioisosteric Design**: The paper addresses the important task of bioisosteric design in a 3D-native manner, directly conditioning on 3D shape and pharmacophore patterns. This is a significant advantage over 2D graph-based methods. The two proposed strategies are intuitive and complementary: Interpolate-Integrate provides 'soft' guidance for high-fidelity edits, while Replacement Guidance offers 'hard' anchoring for fragment merging.

- **Strong Empirical Validation:** The framework is not just a theoretical proposal; it is validated across three challenging and highly relevant tasks in drug discovery (natural product hopping, bioisosteric fragment merging, and pharmacophore merging).

### Weaknesses
**1. Theoretical Justification and Ablation for Replacement Guidance**

I wonder the theoretical justification for the Replacement Guidance. As I understand it, the method control the ODE process by replacing a portion of the state $x_t$ with a clean fragment structure $x_{frag}$ at each step.This creates a partially 'clean', out-of-distribution (OOD) state that the SemlaFlow model never encountered during its unconditional training (which only included fully noised states). It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on why this OOD state manipulation is effective and preferable to using a noised fragment $x_{frag; t}$ (which would be in-distribution).

Furthermore, I am curious if the authors have explored the alternative of applying guidance to the self-conditioning term $\hat{x_1}$ rather than manipulating the state $x_t$. 

The paper would be significantly strengthened by including ablation studies on these design choices (e.g., clean vs. noised fragment injection, state $x_t$ vs. prediction $\hat{x_1}$ manipulation).

**2. Omission of Related Work on Bioisosteric Design**

The related work section provides a good overview of 3D conditional and inference-time methods, but it appears to overlook a relevant line of research focused specifically on fragment-based bioisosteric design and editing [1, 2]. While these methods may differ in their approach (e.g., 2D graph-based vs. 3D-native), they address the same core task. Including them would provide readers with a more complete context of the bioisosteric design field, even if direct experimental comparison is not the focus.

**3. Limited Scope of Property Optimization**

The paper compellingly demonstrates control over 3D similarity and synthetic accessibility (SA score). However, bioisosteric replacement, especially in the lead optimization stage, often requires the simultaneous optimization of other key physicochemical properties (e.g., logP, TPSA, Molecular Weight) [1, 2]. It is not clear from the paper if or how the proposed conditioning strategies could be extended to incorporate guidance towards these scalar property targets. This currently limits the method's immediate applicability for multi-objective lead optimization, which is a primary use case for bioisosteric design.

### Summary
This submission investigates the problem of ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and proposes two inference-time conditioning methods for a given, trained molecule foundation model. Method Interpolate-Integrate takes a seed ligand as input and generates a similar one, starting in the middle of a probability path and first taking steps toward the noise and then integrating forward toward the data. Method Replacement Guidance takes a set of fragments as input and generates a ligand that preserves key interaction patterns of the fragments. The methods build on SemlaFlow (Irwin et al., 2024).Experiments were performed for three important tasks of drug discovery, i.e. natural product ligand hopping, bioisosteric fragment merging, and pharmacophore merging. The proposed methods were compared against SHEPHERD, which conditions on shape, ESP, and pharmacophore grids.

### Strengths
Ligand-based drug design is an important paradigm in drug discovery.

Being able to repurpose pre-trained unconditional models without retraining is practical and efficient. 

Both proposed methods seem computationally cheap to add on top of the base model.

### Weaknesses
The replacement/masking approach has been used in previous works like DiffSBDD for inpainting. The paper should better distinguish its contributions compared to related work.

I have a concern regarding the soundness of the Interpolate-Integrate Method, in particular regarding the seed molecule validity for fragment merging.  I am not convinced the method works properly when given invalid/disconnected seeds.

I have another concern regarding the soundness of Interpolate-Integrate: the method does not really enforce similarity in shape and pharmacophore specifically. It just makes molecules similar to the original seed when τ→1. That is different from preserving specific interaction features. You are getting global similarity, not targeted preservation of binding determinants.

It's unclear how SA is actually considered during generation. The proposed method filters molecules by SA score post-hoc (SA < 4.0 or 4.5), but SA is not used as guidance during the generation process itself.  So the model might be generating lots of complex molecules that just get thrown away. This seems inefficient and makes the "success rate" metric less meaningful - you are just filtering harder, not actually guiding generation toward synthesizable molecules.

The presentation lacks clarity and detail on several key issues of the proposed methods.  See my questions for the details.

### Questions
1) What is novel here beyond applying the replacement/masking approach to a flow matching model? 

2) Several questions regarding Interpolate-Integrate:
* Atom count control: How do you control the number of atoms in the generated molecule?
* Figure 1 conformations: Are the 3D shapes shown from SemlaFlow's generation, or did you run RDKit conformation generation afterward? This matters for understanding what the model actually produces.
* Seed molecule validity for fragment merging: For the fragment merging task, how are seed molecules constructed?
    * Multi-fragment reference: Are you literally concatenating 3 disconnected fragments? That's not a valid molecule.
    * Random atom seeding: "Filling in remaining atoms" is completely underspecified. What does this seed actually look like?
    * Full interaction profile: Instantiating individual atoms at pharmacophore coordinates gives you isolated atoms, not a connected molecule.
* The flow matching model was trained on valid molecules from GEOM-Drugs. How does the interpolation path even work when z₁ is chemically invalid or disconnected?

3) What are the "architectural constraints" preventing Interpolate-Integrate from handling padded inputs like Replacement Guidance can?

4) How do you prevent fragment overlap when combining them?

### Summary
The paper proposes two training-free, inference-time conditioning strategies—Interpolate–Integrate (a mid-path restart on a flow-matching ODE) and Replacement Guidance (hard anchoring and optional relaxation of user-specified fragments)—built atop SemlaFlow, an E(3)-equivariant flow-matching generator for 3D molecules. The methods target three ligand-only design tasks: (1) natural-product ligand hopping, (2) bioisosteric fragment merging on EV-D68 3C protease, and (3) pharmacophore merging for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Evaluation uses PoseBusters validity, synthetic accessibility (SA), 3D similarity (shape/ESP/pharmacophore), and rigid-receptor AutoDock Vina. Reported results show stronger "success rates" and/or top-10 docking among filtered candidates compared to several baselines in selected setups; code is provided via an anonymous link.

### Strengths
- Both controls operate at sampling time without retraining, which is practically attractive for iterative design. Interpolate–Integrate is clearly specified as a mid-path restart with a tunable τ that trades fidelity vs novelty; Replacement Guidance formalizes fragment anchoring with user-controlled relaxation.
- The paper demonstrates three realistic tasks (NP hopping; EV-D68 fragment merge; Mpro pharmacophore merge) with metrics spanning SA, PoseBusters validity, 3D similarity, and docking.
- Sensible $\tau$ / $\phi$ ablations illustrate controllability and the fidelity–novelty trade-off.
- An anonymous repository link is provided.

### Weaknesses
- "Success rate" and similarity/docking are reported after SA and PoseBusters filtering; key tables focus on the top-10 among successful molecules, which inflates perceived gains and obscures unconditional quality and sample efficiency. Some comparisons are only feasible under a manually curated setup (Full Interaction Profile), limiting fairness and generality across methods. Please provide full, unfiltered distributions and uniform pipelines across baselines. 
- For Mpro, docking uses a single rigid receptor; improvements in top-10 Vina (filtered) do not establish binding or pose realism and are fragile to receptor flexibility and scoring-function bias. No physics-based refinement, ensemble receptors, or wet-lab validation is provided.
- The EV-D68 analysis mixes multiple conditioning regimes; authors note a direct comparison is only possible for the curated profile. This undermines cross-method conclusions; several baselines show zero success under the authors' pipeline, suggesting a setup mismatch rather than method inferiority. Re-run all methods under the same input specification and filters.
- SA and PoseBusters are necessary but insufficient; there is no report of synthesizability beyond SA (e.g., route-based metrics), drug-likeness/ADMET proxies, stereochemistry handling, or diversity/novelty vs bioactivity retention across the full set. The evaluation would benefit from route-planning feasibility and multi-objective profiling.
- Interpolate–Integrate is positioned as the first mid-path restart for flow-matching models, but its analogy to diffusion editing is acknowledged; the empirical section does not clearly isolate a capability that cannot be matched by established editing/guidance in diffusion with comparable compute. Stronger head-to-head controls are needed.
- Replacement Guidance projects the ODE step back onto a masked manifold via hard replacement; this projection can disrupt the learned flow and potentially induce artifacts (e.g., broken connectivity) unless carefully relaxed. The paper mentions user-chosen relaxation but lacks theoretical guarantees or stability analyses beyond small ablations.
- All tasks are ligand-only. There is no demonstration of pocket-conditioned SBDD or cross-target transfer where protein contexts drive constraints—limits the scope of the claimed “bioisosteric design” advantages. (The EV-D68 and Mpro studies still evaluate with docking rather than explicit pocket-aware generation.)
