## Abstract
Feature selection process is essential in machine learning by discovering the most relevant features to the modeling target. By exploring the potential complex correlations among features of unlabeled data, recently introduced self-supervision-enhanced feature selection greatly reduces the reliance on the labeled samples. However, they are generally based on the autoencoder with sample-wise self-supervision, which can hardly exploit relations among samples. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Graph representation learning enhanced Semi-supervised Feature Selection(G-FS) which performs feature selection based on the discovery and exploitation of the non-Euclidean relations among features and samples by translating unlabeled ``plain" tabular data into a bipartite graph. A self-supervised edge prediction task is designed to distill rich information on the graph into low-dimensional embeddings, which remove redundant features and noise. Guided by the condensed graph representation, we propose a batch-attention feature weight generation mechanism that generates more robust weights according to batch-based selection patterns rather than individual samples. The results show that G-FS achieves significant performance edges in 12 datasets compared to ten state-of-the-art baselines, including two recent self-supervised baselines.

### Summary
This article focuses on semi-supervised feature selection. The authors argued that the existing methods can hardly exploit the  relations among samples, so they proposed a  graph representation learning approach named G-FS. G-FS could capture the non-Euclidean relations among features and samples with a a bipartite graph strategy. G-FS achieves significant performance edges in 12 datasets compared with baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well organized.
2. Feature selection is important for many areas, the motivation is sound.
3. The experiments are comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed model will introduce more parameters by using GNN. The efficiency should be investigated.
2. Compared with XGB, the improvement brought by G-FS is not that significant. It should be discussed.
3. The visualization of tSNE has certain degrees of randomness, it is not sure the result in Figure 3 is convincing since the advantage is small.

### Questions
1. The proposed model will introduce more parameters by using GNN. The efficiency should be investigated.
2. Compared with XGB, the improvement brought by G-FS is not that significant. It should be discussed.

### Summary
This paper study a traditional problem feature selection. It first revisits several remaining issues limit the capability of existing self-supervision enhanced feature selection methods: Then, it proposes a novel method G-FS which performs feature selection based on the discovery and exploitation of the non-Euclidean relations among features and samples by translating unlabeled “plain” tabular data into a bipartite graph. Finally, it conducts some experiments to evaluate the proposed method, showing that the proposed method sometimes outperforms baselines on several tasks across multiple datasets.

### Strengths
1.	It tests on several widely-used datasets, and the proposed method can sometimes beat the existing methods.

### Weaknesses
1.	The core part (the proposed method in Section 3) lacks of sufficient analysis. We know that it is not difficult to put different modules together to form a paper. But we should make sure that the motivation of doing that really makes sense and we should understand what we are doing.
2.	Confusion of symbol system. For example, the “onehot” in Eq. 5.
3.	The writing needs to be largely improved. The content in introduction is hard to follow. It is also hard to follow the content in Section 3.

### Questions
1.	See the weakness in the “*Weaknesses” part.

### Summary
This article presents an innovative, self-supervised method for augmenting raw features through graph representations. This approach facilitates interaction between samples and features and employs a batch-attention mechanism for feature selection by assigning weights to each dimension of the augmented feature. More specifically, each feature dimension is represented as a unique node, and each sample is also depicted as a unique node with the raw feature of that sample serving as the node feature. Each edge signifies that a sample possesses the edge attribute value at that particular feature dimension. The goal of the self-supervised method is to predict edge attribute, which finally generated augmented features. Experimental results demonstrate that this novel method surpasses traditional benchmarks in most tasks and datasets.

### Strengths
1.This paper presents a highly innovative and inspiring approach to representing tabular data and implementing self-supervised learning for augmentations.

2.The proposed method primarily consists of two components: sample-sample interaction and sample-feature interaction.

3.Empirical experiments have been meticulously conducted to compare performance with baseline models and to investigate the effectiveness of the two main components.

### Weaknesses
1.Certain equations, like Eq (1) where the sum notation of j is missing, and Eq (4) which doesn't accurately reflect its preceding description, may lead to confusion or mistakes.

2.In Table 1, the arrow for the Testator dataset should be pointing upwards.

3.The paper fails to establish a strong connection between the proposed method and semi-supervised learning, as all referenced methods show a similar performance improvement trend with an increase in labeled data.

4.The section titled "Feature selection under different GNN architecture" doesn't discuss the number of GNN layers, which could potentially lead to oversquashing issues. Furthermore, given that we have two types of nodes (sample and feature), it may not be equitable to compare this with a homophily-based GNN model such as GCN.

### Questions
1.How will the different number of the layer of GNN influence the performance? Is there any possible oversquashing or heterophily related problem for your proposed graph building method?

2.What is difference or significance of this method applied in semi-supervised learning and normal supervised learning?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of semi-supervised feature selection. The authors introduce a graph representation learning-enhanced semi-supervised feature selection framework called G-FS, which transforms unlabeled tabular data into a bipartite graph to discover relationships between features and samples. They design a self-supervised edge prediction task to convert rich information on the graph into low-dimensional embeddings, reducing redundant features and noise. Additionally, the authors propose a batch-attention feature weight generation mechanism, which can generate more robust weights.

### Strengths
- The idea of enhancing semi-supervised feature selection using graph representation learning is novel. 
- Mapping tabular data to a bipartite graph allows for the exploration of more potential relationships.

### Weaknesses
- The writing of the paper can be further improved.
- The improvements over existing methods are not significant.

### Questions
- In Figure 1b, the authors depict the sample-label relationship. However, this relationship is not mentioned in the text. In the introduction, the authors mention three types of relationships, yet in Figure 1c, four types of relationships are referenced.
- Minor errors: In Section 4.2, the reference to Table 1 is incorrectly written as Figure 1. (To verify the performance of G-FS, G-FS is compared with other feature selection methods on 12 different datasets (refer to Figure 1).)
