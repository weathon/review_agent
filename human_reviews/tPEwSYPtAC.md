# Towards Robust Out-of-Distribution Generalization Bounds via Sharpness

- Avg Score: 6.75
- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data or unseen domain, termed OOD generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, sharpness of learned minimum influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by "robustness" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for "flat minima leads to better OOD generalization". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks.

## Human Reviewer 1

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper gives a tight upper bound of out-of-distribution (OOD) by taking robustness into account and discusses the connection between robustness and sharpness of the loss landscape. The author proves the robust generalization bound by partitioning the sample space and measuring the distributional shift of each sub-group. As to the connection between robustness and sharpness, the author proves a theorem stating that sharper models give a larger upper bound on robustness, which aligns with the intuition that sharper models are more prone to overfitting, which hurts OOD generalization.

### Strengths
1. Using the partitioning method to achieve a tighter bound is interesting and also leads to a good result.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with clear explanations of key concepts and terminology.
3. The new distance metric better tolerates distributional shift compared with previous work.

### Weaknesses
The assumptions and constraints are a bit hard to meet and also may hurt the generalizability of the results.(See my questions)

### Questions
1. The author can give a clear explanation of ε(S) when describing definition of robustness (Def 2.2).
2. Have you considered the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of your method? Can give some deeper discussion on this.

### Summary
This paper provides generalization bounds for Out of Distribution Generalization based on the sharpness of the loss function minimum attained. One of the main ideas is to partition the input space according to the suggestion in [1]: it is assumed that the loss function doesn't vary too much inside each "relevant" subset of a partition of space (this is loosely related to the flatness of the minima) where "relevant" means close to an observed sample. Based on this assumption, the authors are able to bound (in Theorem 3.1)  the error as a sum of: 

1 the empirical error in the source domain
2 the relaxed TV distance between the distributions in the partition considered
3 The robustness of the algorithm/loss (how much the loss can vary for points in a given partition element close to a sample
4 some function class capacity term. 

The proof is a straightforward manipulation of the definitions.

The, corollary 3.2 attempts to show that the limiting behavior of Theorem 3.1 is the same as that of the main result of [1] which relies on the traditional TV distance. 

In the next results, the authors rely on some ideas from [2] as well as brute force calculations to relate the concept of robustness of [1] and this work to that of the flatness of the local minima in the case of a kernel regression problem equivalent to a two layer neural network where only the last layer is trained.  The flatness and the norm of the parameter vectors are then claimed to be related in the case of ridge regression, and synthetic data experiments demonstrate superior OOD performance is associated with stronger genralization.

=====================Post rebuttal=================




Post-Rebuttal

I thank the authors for the rebuttal and for substantially improving the quality of the paper by fixing many of the errors I mentioned in the proofs. 
I am not an expert in this particular field, so it is difficult for me to vouch for the correctness of all of the work, especially given that the first version had a very large number of errors that made reading impossible and necessitated a very deep revision. To the best of my understanding, the revision makes sense at a high level, but there are still minor errors, including both in parts of the paper I had not originally commented on, and parts of the paper that were rewritten for this revision (details below). **However, since those remaining errors appear minor and reviewers 2MLh and b2N6 are very positive about the paper and the authors have made an effort already, I am increasing my score from 5 to six.  In addition, since I have not found any fatal or serious errors in the revision, I am increasing my soundness rating to fair (from poor).**

However, I **very strongly recommend** the authors take at least two weeks of **full time** work to re-read all of the paper and **fix all the errors** and improve the proofs. To the best of my understanding, this is still necessary.  I don’t mean just fixing the errors that I caught, I mean fixing the ones that none of the reviewers caught.

### Strengths
Assuming they are correct, the results are certainly very interesting and promise to be the basis for further research. There is quite a lot of non trivial work in this paper, and many proofs require complicated calculations and take inspiration from a variety of existing work.

### Weaknesses
The appendix and many parts of the main paper very severely lack polishing to the extent that communication is difficult. Many of the proofs look more like a first draft than a serious submission. In particular, I can't vouch for the correctness of any results past Theorem 3.1 (which is not 100 percent correct either. In addition to poor language and presentation, the organization of the paper in terms of which assumptions are made is not good. The paper just needs more calm work and rewording: the authors of the appendix appear in a rush. 


Here are more details: 

First, although this is a minor point, it is worth mentioning that the constants in Theorem 3.1 don't seem to be fully correct. Indeed, the proof relies on a combination of Lemma 1 and Lemma C.3 from the arXiv version of [1], with both theorems relying on excluding a low probability event. Since combining both results requires a union bound, all the $\delta$s should be changed to $\delta/2$, resulting in different constants throughout. The same issued shows up in the proof of Proposition C.5. Note also that the result cited from [1] in Lemma C.3. is not in the published version, but in the arXiv version only. There are no Theorems 2 and 3.2 in the NeurIPS version, THis is Theorem 2 from NeurIPS and Theorem 3.2 from arXiv (
However, the same result can be lifter from [3] instead.) In addition, the combination of both results should be done explicitly since the constants are wrong again due to not applying the union bound. Also, I am really not sure the authors are actually using Theorem 3.2 rather than a simple generalization bound in terms of VC dimension. 


Theorem 3.4 makes sense as a statement (though I couldn't check the full proof), but is very hard to read and contains plenty of minor errors. Why is $z_i(A)=argmax...$ unique? It seems the authors mean to say that $z_i\in argmax....$. When defining $\mathcal{M}_i$ as "the set of gobal minima in $C_i$", the authors actually mean that $\mathcal{M}_i$ as a set is the argmin of the objective function over $C_i$ (in particular, the elements are "global" minima inside the partition element $C_i$, but not necessarily global minima for the whole problem). This is absolutely not clearly written. It is also not clear why a different definition style is used for $|mathcal{M}_i$ and for $z-i(A)$ in that case Every statement in this paper is written vaguely using words instead of maths, adding to the burden of trying to make sense of what is attempted here. 







==================Minor comments============


What is Theorem C.2 a restatement of? It seems it is Theorem 3.1 but it is not written (only the title "restate"). 

The wording of transitions  is quite sloppy. For instance, in page 14 we have the sentence "In order to give a fine-grained analysis, we follow the common choice where a two-layer NN function class is widely analysed in most literature, i.e. Neural Tangent Kernel, rich regime, random feature models." What do the authors mean by "rich regime"? 

Note also at the top of page 14, the integral is not properly written as I believe the authors actually meant to write $\int f(x)g(y) \tau_d(d(x,y))$ instead of $\int f(x)g(y) \tau_d(dx)$  (otherwise the quantity is just equal to 1). 
 

The statement of Corollary 3.2 is not really mathematically well defined. What the authors mean is that the bound from Theorem 3.1 converges to the RHS of equation (3), but what is written is just that the OOD generalization error is bounded by it. The "proof" is not very clean either. 

The second sentence of Theorem 3.1 should contain a word such as "assume that". 

The description of the case where $K=1$ above corollary 3.2 seems quite dodgy as it implies that the loss is approximately constant in the whole of input space! 


Note that even the definition of one of the main concepts of this paper, i.e. robustness as in Definition 2.2, is not very well introduced: there "for all" which relates to $s,z$ is duplicated, and there is a "for all i$ after the $forall $s,z\in C_i$ (which depends on $i$). This makes this much harder to read than necessary. Note that the definition in [1] is much cleaner. It should be copied more faithfully. 



====================Typos====================

There are plenty of issues with the language, not only in terms of improper use of grammar to an extent that harms understanding, but also in terms of polishing, spelling and punctuation. Below is a highly non exhaustive list. 


In the abstract, fourth line "sharpness of learned minimum influences" should be "the sharpness of learned minima influences" 

Page 2: to the left of the figure, "as shown in \cite... that when the loss lanscape...": a coma would be better than "that"

Every theorem which is lifted from a reference involves the text of the name of the authors written twice (once manually and once via the \cite function). This is probably due to copy and paste from another template with a different citation style without checking through it again. (prop. 2.1, definition 3.3

Page 21, "under this case" should be "in this case" 

Equation (44), there is an equal sign with three bars instead of 2 where I think the authors actually mean equality in the strict sense. 

Line 3 of Section 3.1 " $(K,\epsilon)$-robust" should be "..robustness..."

In page 5 (theorem 3.4), there is a "w.p. a" which probably should just be "w.p."


There are plenty of "w.r.t" and "i.i.d" (missing period) throughout the text. 


In appendix D, note the use of "where definition of ....please refer to the corollary 3.5" 

In page 18 at the beginning of the proof of Lemma D.1, although I agree that equation (29) makes sense, the sentence which introduces it speaks of the smallest eigenvalue whilst the equation itself shows the equivalent statement expressed as an PSD inequality between matrices. 

Just below equation (27), it is unclear what the authors mean by saying that "$\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{F}\Delta \mathcal{F}}$ represents the algorithm" WHat algorithm?

### Questions
Could you write down a proof of  Proposition C.5 clarifying if you are using a standard VC bound or Theorem 3.2 from arxiv [1], and fixing the constants from the union bound? 


Do you stand by your proof of Lemma D.5? It seems sloppy to the point of being completely incomprehensible, though I believe a similar result probably holds. Is equation (46) an equation or an approximation ? It seems that the probability (LHS) should be equal to $2\phi/\pi$ and not involvea $cos$ at all. For equation (47), it seems that you are calculating the bound the wrong way around: equation (47) holds if the inequality is reversed inside the probability statement. In the next substantial revision you upload, could you also include a precise restatement and citation for "Robbin's bounds".


What is going on in Equation (64)? The statement of Theorem 3.4 appears to be agnostic w.r.t. the choice of loss function, but the proof says "ohh we can verify that this holds for common loss functions such as L1, MSE, MAE etc.'. How do you get the first equality in (64), and does it hold for all loss functions? Please rewrite the proof accordingly. 

Could you fix the "definitions" in corollary 3.5? When taken at face value, I maintain that $L_{x^*}=0$: there is something missing there. Also, although I guess that $\hat{w}_min$ is the minimum absolute value of any entry of $\hat{w}$ this is not clear from the definition since the notation $|\cdot|$ to mean element wise absolute value is non standard. 


 
Please rewrite all the proofs much more carefully and upload a revision. It may help to ask another author to read the proofs.

### Summary
The authors introduce an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization bound based on Sharpness that incorporates robustness, leading to a more precise bound compared to non-robust guarantees. The given results are validated through experiments conducted on both a ridge regression model and some deep learning classification tasks.

### Strengths
-	The given bound seem to be tighter than existing non-robust guarantees.
-	The experiments are well conducted on ridge regression and simple classification tasks using MLP.

### Weaknesses
-	The datasets being used are overly simplistic, making it difficult to ensure the validity of theoretical outcomes. Empirical evidence from [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] demonstrate that sharpness is limited in the context of small datasets like CIFA10 or SVHN. Comprehensive evaluations involving transformers, ConvNet, CLIP, and BERT  trained on larger datasets such as ImageNet and MNLI reveal a weak correlation between sharpness and generalization. Surprisingly, a consistent negative correlation between sharpness and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization suggests that sharper minima might actually generalize better, contradicting the authors' proposed theory. Moreover, experiments in [6] indicate that the choice of sharpness definition heavily depends on the specific dataset. To substantiate their theoretical claims, it is essential for the authors to conduct more extensive experiments on larger and more intricate datasets using complex models.

-	Numerous studies propose that flatter minima might offer better generalization for both standard and out-of-distribution (OOD) data such as [7] and [8]. However, traditional sharpness definitions often fall short in capturing generalization accurately, potentially because they are not consistent under reparametrizations that do not change the model itself. To tackle these issues, Adaptive Sharpness and reparametrization-invariant sharpness have been developed. I anticipate seeing the theoretical results related to Adaptive Sharpness and reparametrization-invariant sharpness.

### Summary
This paper studies the relationship between robustness and sharpness in improving OOD generalization performance. The authors provided rigorous theoretical analyses through the PAC learning framework to give an intuitive insight into why minimizing sharpness can lead to better OOD performance. This paper is the first work to reveal the benefits of flatness to OOD generalization. Moreover, based on existing theoretical results, a titer error bound is proposed. Empirically, the authors choose two simple datasets RotateMNIST and a self-generated dataset to validate the findings of their theory. This is a pure theoretical paper which is a solid contribution to related fields.

### Strengths
- The theoretical derivation is rigorously demonstrated. It is solid work by providing support for encouraging flat minima on OOD generalization problems.
- All the results are very intuitive and confirm many assumptions of my own.
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- Why conducting partition on all training data is still not clear to me. It is reasonable that a small distribution shift in the same sub-group could lead to noise and should be ignored. But how such a strategy is formulated is unknown. Besides, could it be possible to conduct an ablation study to justify that such kind of partition is indeed helpful for OOD generalization?
- The results in Figure 4 are interesting. However, some intuitive explanations are missing. For example, why did the test error of the worst-case group first decrease along the correlation probability and then increase?
- It would be much more helpful if the authors could provide the experimental results on larger datasets such as DomainBed and WILDS. I understand theoretical papers could still have gaps in realistic application, but it would be helpful for us to find problems and look for possible directions.
