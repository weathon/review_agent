## Abstract
The lack of an acceptable confidence level associated with the predictions of Machine Learning (ML) models may inhibit their deployment and usage. A practical way to avoid this drawback is to enhance these predictions with trustworthiness and risk-aware add-ons such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Typically, the quantified uncertainty mainly captures two intertwined parts: an epistemic uncertainty component linked to a lack of observed data and an aleatoric uncertainty component due to irreducible variability. Several existing UQ-paradigms aim to disentangle the total quantified uncertainty into these two parts, with the aim of distinguishing model irrelevance from high uncertainty-level decisions. However, few of them are delving deeper into evaluating the disentanglement result, even less on real-world data. In this paper, we propose and implement a methodology to assess the effectiveness of uncertainty disentanglement through benchmarking of various UQ approaches. We introduce some indicators that allow us to robustly assess the decomposition feasibility in the absence of ground truth. The evaluation is done using an epistemic variability injection mechanism on four state-of-the-art UQ approaches based on ML models, on both synthetic and real-world gas demand datasets. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for better understanding and selection of the relevant UQ approach. The corresponding code and data can be found in the Github repository.

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a framework for measuring the effectiveness of modern uncertainty quantification methods (UQ) for the task of disentangled uncertainty quantification (dUQ), which attempts to factorize the uncertainty of a model into reducible epistemic uncertainty and irreducible aleatoric uncertainty. To this end, the authors propose the disentangled Epistemic indicator (dE-Ind), corresponding to a ratio of predicted aleatoric to epistemic uncertainty from their qQU model output, and novel epistemic injection schemes for training and inference. The authors demonstrate their framework across 5 different modern ML UQ models and several datasets.

### Strengths
- The authors conduct a thorough analysis over recent methods in the field of uncertainty quantification in application to their problem setup.
- The problem of measuring epistemic uncertainty, with no ground truth, is an important question, and the authors initially positioned their work nicely in context with respect to related work.

### Weaknesses
- There is a lack of clarity in the story of this paper, and what the authors consider their main contributions. In the introduction, they state that "In this article, we seek to bridge this gap by introducing a dUQ evaluation methodology providing a comprehensive benchmark of various typologies of UQ models." but later on, in section three, they state that "The experimental goal is to highlight an epistemic confidence gap in model predictions, between nominal and altered queries (i.e. affected by injections of epistemic uncertainty)." 
- The writing is very dense and the presentation makes the content more difficult to understand. In particular, Figures 1 and 3 have to much detail and are too difficult to follow in tandem with the text, which is itself not precise and can be quite confusing. Figure 2 is also unclear as to where we should be paying attention, or what insight to draw from it. For an example of a sentence I had difficulty understanding: "These two components are defined for and in a given modeling scope, resulting from the methodological choice of both observed features and model type, which depends on the predictive task’s characteristics".
- The paper has an entire section dedicated to training epistemic injections, but this is never mentioned before as a part of their contribution or utility. The beginning of the paper makes it seem like they offer an evaluation of modern methods, but this along with the meta-model seem to be proposing training procedures?

### Questions
- Why is the training set parameterized by theta? (above equation 1 on page 3)
- Is Θ related to all different partitions of a particular dataset, or from the true distribution of data? 
- What is meant above Figure 1 with "the previous negligible terms can then induce blurs into the uncertainty decomposition."?
- What is the mentioned variability infusion mechanism referring to?
- When Meta-models are introduced they are not explained. I see that they are mentioned later in the results section, but at a high level are these supposed to be neural networks?
- What was the rational behind the equation for dE-Ind? Why that particular ratio?
- What are queries in this context? The term is introduced at the beginning of section 3, but it is unclear what it represents. Similarly, epistemic query injections are discussed by never defined.
- What was the intention with the inclusion of section 4.1? Was it to evaluate the existing methods on these new benchmarks?
- It's very difficult to parse the analysis for the results in Figure 4. What are the high level takeaways?
- In Table 3, what is meant by "no cross validation due to size of the dataset"?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of evaluating epistemic uncertainties outputted by a Gaussian auto-regressive model. The authors proposed an injection scheme where the model is asked to make predictions on modified inputs, and the epistemic uncertainty can then be compared between the raw input and modified inputs.

### Strengths
This paper examines an important question of evaluating epistemic uncertainty, which remains challenging in predictive ML. On the top level, modifying inputs and checking how the predicted uncertainties vary sounds intuitively promising and could lead to interesting future developments.

### Weaknesses
However, on the negative side, this paper has critical issues with the soundingness of the approach and the overall clarity.

For the soundingness of the approach, one fundamental problem in this paper was that the proposed (dE-Ind) didn't get any theoretical justification. While intuitively, the change in the proportion of epistemic uncertainty might be an interesting metric to check, it doesn't solve the essential problem of there isn't a so-called ground truth with epistemic uncertainty. In fact, there has been recent work that indicates there might not be a proper loss for the epistemic uncertainty that can be evaluated with data (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12736). Furthermore, the injection schemes to compute the proposed metric also lack support. There isn't a clear discussion on how the proposed injection was the correct one to generate inputs that provide the suitable change of uncertainty. The description of methods is also quite handwavy, as some steps are just given without any background (i.e. use SHAP to modify input features).

On the clarity part, this paper doesn't have consistent mathematical notations and might cause some significant issues for the readers. The boldface x is used both with the time index as part of a time series and with the instance index as a training example. The function notation f and expectation notation E use the bold and non-bold font without any apparent difference. Additional marks like \bar, \hat, * are all directly given without a clear introduction.

### Questions
I wonder if the authors can give any insight on how the injection method, together with the dE-Ind metric, could give the correct evaluation of epistemic uncertainty, and what is the optimal epistemic uncertainty with your defined metric?

### Summary
The authors propose a new framework for evaluating different approaches for UQ in regression models.  They propose two types of epistemic variability injections in order to quantify a confidence gap of a model.

### Strengths
The authors address the important task on how to quantify the qulaity of UQ methods; I appreciate the introduction of 2 new dataset, a real one and a synthetic one, which helps towards a more realistic evaluation

### Weaknesses
- The authors missed a while section of the literature,  on calibration for regression models, which covers a highly related task. In particular [1] demonstrates how calibration quantifies a meaningful tradeoff between sharpness and coverage
- I found the concepts of Inference step injection of epistemic variability injections and Training step injectionare fairly straight-forward concepts, which are presented in a convoluted manner - here the clarity of the paper could be improved substantially
- It's not clear how the choices of the type of "attack" in the inference step rejection influence the conclusion - surely the way outliers are sampled from the tail (how far) is relevant? Similarly, how altered is the altered dataset and hwo does this effect conclusions? To me the main contribution is the benchmark study and this would need a much more exhaustive and systematic set of experiments
