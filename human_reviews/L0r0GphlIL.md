## Abstract
In many neural networks, different values of the parameters may result in the same loss value. Parameter space symmetries are loss-invariant transformations that change the model parameters. Teleportation applies such transformations to accelerate optimization. However, the exact mechanism behind this algorithm's success is not well understood. In this paper, we show that teleportation not only speeds up optimization in the short-term, but gives overall faster time to convergence. Additionally, teleporting to minima with different curvatures improves generalization, which suggests a connection between the curvature of the minimum and generalization ability. Finally, we show that integrating teleportation into a wide range of optimization algorithms and optimization-based meta-learning improves convergence. Our results showcase the versatility of teleportation and demonstrate the potential of incorporating symmetry in optimization.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the effect of teleportation technique in improving training and generalization performance of deep learning tasks. The authors first analyze the convergence property of teleportation in SGD and Newton's method. The effect of teleportation in improving generalization is justified using the concept of sharpness and curvature. Some numerical experiments verify the findings.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a convergence analysis for SGD with teleportation, and shows that it can improve the generalization of the solution. This demonstrates that teleportation has the potential to become a standard tool in modern deep learning training tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. My foremost concern is that, compared to existing work on parameter symmetry [1], this work seems more or less incremental in theory, basically extending the analysis from [1] to SGD and Newton's method. Moreover, the extension to SGD is done not based on standard noise assumption. The new results on generalization are justified mostly by experiments, rather than in theory.
2. The main assumptions are not clearly stated. I would suggest separating the assumptions rather than stating them at the beginning of each result. Moreover, the main result switches between stochastic (SGD) and deterministic settings (Newton's method), which makes it less accessible to the readers.

### Questions
1. What's the actual cost of one teleportation operation (group action) in practice? The authors conduct experiments on small-scale tasks. For huge deep networks, is it feasible to carry out one single teleportaion?
2. Is it possible to show that teleportation achieves better generalization bounds using tools like algorithm stability [2] ? The current results are encouraging but a bit lack of rigourous theoretical proof.

### Summary
Teleportation is the transformation of the parameters in the parameters such that the loss is unchanged. This work theoretically shows that teleportation has accelerating effects on the convergence rate of SGD for non-convex loss. Furthermore, through experiments, they show that teleportation can also improve generalization by moving the parameters to a flatter region.

### Strengths
- The authors are able to prove a stronger convergence guarantee for SGD by using transportation. Instead of having a guarantee for a single stationary point like the classic SGD, they show that SGD with teleportation has convergence guarantees for a set of stationary points in group $G$. The intuition on why SGD with teleportation has accelerating effects is well explained by connecting it with second-order algorithms.

- The paper shows that one teleportation might be enough which makes it feasible to do in practice.

- The curvature of minima seems like a pretty interesting way to understand the generalization ability of the stationary points.

- The paper is well-written overall.

### Weaknesses
- I'm a bit confused about the claim that teleportation accelerates the convergence rate of SGD. The intuition part makes sense to me since it has the quadratic error term that typically arises from second-order optimization but the convergence rate in Theorem 3.1 is still $O(\epsilon^{-4}$ ), which is the same as SGD. The convergence guarantee is slightly stronger but I don't understand how we can claim teleportation accelerates the convergence rate of SGD.

- Even though the claim is teleportation improves the convergence rate for Adagrad, SGD with momentum, RMSProp, and Adam, the only clear improvements that I could see from Figure 5 is Adagrad. The other graphs seem to have similar performance for algorithm with or without teleportation.

### Questions
- Does cross-entropy loss satisfy the condition for one teleportation in section 3.3? The experiment on Cifar 10 uses one-time teleportation but the remark in section 3.3 only mentions quadratic loss. 

- Does it matter at which epoch we perform the teleportation? If it does, how do we pick the best epoch?

- In page 7, it says teleporting to points with smaller curvature helps find a minimum with lower validation loss but in the left graph of figure 4, the loss when we move to a place with decreased curvature is actually higher. Am I missing something here?

### Summary
Typical deep learning models have natural symmetries on their weight parameters that leave their output unchanged. The study of parameter symmetries in deep learning focuses on the effects of these symmetries in terms of optimization and generalization performance. The present work contributes to this burgeoning field by first offering an analysis of "teleported" SGD, an algorithm proposed by [1] which uses the symmetries to move the current iterate to one with largest (under the group action) gradient. Their first contribution is an analysis which shows that teleported SGD yields improved guarantees for SGD for smooth (possibly non-convex) functions. It was shown in [1] that teleportation (in the GD rather than SGD setting) is equivalent to a step of Newton's method, and they accordingly give an estimate of its contraction rate that demonstrates quadratic convergence as would be expected from a 2nd order method. Their final theoretical results are sufficient conditions for one teleportation step to be optimal for all times. They then provide empirical studies of the effects of teleportation for increasing/decreasing the sharpness and curvature of minima. Finally, the authors consider teleported variants of other standard optimization algorithms (Adagrad, SGD with momentenum, RMS prop, and Adam), and propose a method for meta-learning the teleportation.

### Strengths
This paper is written in a very clear and engaging style, and was a pleasure to read. The exploration of sufficient conditions for one-teleportation to be enough (section 3.3, especially Prop. 3.4) and the effects of teleporting for sharpness/curvature (section 4), plus their computationally feasible proxies $\phi$ and $\psi$ are, to my understanding, significant and novel. Finally, their empirical results are clear and original. For example, Figure 5 on the effects of teleportation on other first-order algorithms is particularly convincing. And their use of Pearson correlation in Table 1 to estimate the effects of curvature and sharpness is impressive.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I really like the paper. One weakness, however, is that some of their theoretical results are not especially novel. For example their results on teleported SGD (Theorem 3.1) and the Newton steps (Prop. 3.2) seems to be minor modifications of standard proof techniques. And the (very interesting) fact that teleported SGD is equivalent to a Newton iteration was already observed by previous work [1]. However, this is no way inclines me to reject the paper -- I think its clarity and other contributions are more than enough to merit acceptance.

### Questions
- It seems that Definition 3.3 doesn't exclude *minimizers* of $w \mapsto \|\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial w\|^2$. It might help the exposition to mention this.
- I am a bit confused about Figure 4: the paper text says "teleporting to points with smaller curvatures helps find a minimum with lower validation loss, while teleporting to points with larger curvatures has the opposite effect". And this relationship, that less curvature is associated with better generalization performance, is also present in Table 1. However, Figure 4 seems to show the opposite phenomenon: the teleport(increase $\psi$) test loss is better than the teleport(decrease $\psi$) test loss. Am I mis-reading this plot? Could you please clarify this point, ideally in the paper text as well?
- "from Lemma A.1 below" before equation 26 and on page 13 should instead read "from Lemma A.1 above"

### Summary
The paper investigates how teleportation, i.e., applying a loss-invariant group action to the parameter space can improve (i) optimization speed and (ii) generalization in deep learning. For (i), the paper derives an upper bound for the gradient norm, which implies that SGD iterates converge to a basin of stationary points, from which only other stationary points are reachable via teleportation. They further show that SGD with teleportation can behave similar to Newton's method and provide a necessary condition on when one teleportation step is sufficent to accelerate optimization. They extend teleportation to commonly used optimizers and experimentally show that a teleportation step in the first epoch improves the convergence rate. Lastly, they incorporate teleportation into a meta-learned optimizer and show that learning the group element in teleportation improves the convergence rate of (meta-learned) gradient descent. For (ii), the paper introduces a novel measure for generalization based on the curvature of minima, and empirically shows that teleporting to points which decrease sharpness and increase the curvature of minima correlates with an improvement in generalization.

### Strengths
The paper provides novel results on exploiting parameter symmetries in the context of optimization and generalization in deep learning. For optimization, the theoretical results improve on existing work, while the paper appears to be the first to investigate teleportation with respect to generalization. The presented results also have promise to be of practical relevance, since the computational overhead of the teleportation step appears to be negligible in the experiments.

### Weaknesses
* **Clarity**: Although the paper is generally well-written, I did find it difficult to follow at times, especially with respect to the overall structure. One suggestion would be to switch the order of sections 4 and 5, as section 5 investigates how teleportation improves optimization, while section 4 is more or less self-contained with respect to generalization. I would also suggest having a (sub)section which is dedicated to introducing the necessary preliminaries and assumptions, with additional pointers to literature (e.g., some of the notation in section 3.3 could be introduced in the preliminaries already). In the appendix, it would be helpful to restate all the needed notation and equation, so the reader does not have to switch between the main paper and the appendix to follow the proofs.
* **Reproducibility**: If I am not mistaken, there is no reference to or mention of any source code; it would be great to make your code publicly available.

Please find some minor remarks below:

* p. 3: we provide theoretical analysis of teleportation -> we provide a theoretical analysis of teleportation
* p. 3: that maximizes the magnitude of gradient -> that maximizes the magnitude of the gradient 
* p. 3: the iterates equation 4 -> the iterates in equation 4
* p. 3, Theorem 3.1: I assume $\theta$ should be $w$
* Proposition 3.2: I assume $f$ should be $\mathcal{L}$
* p. 5: To simplify notations -> To simplify notation
* p. 7: at the 20 epoch -> at the 20th epoch/at epoch 20
* p. 7: teleporting to sharper point -> teleporting to sharper points
* Lemma A.1: eq. (19) LHS: $\xi$ seems to be missing in $\mathcal{L}$, also 2 lines below

### Questions
1. In the experiments, have you tried teleporting more often than just in the first epoch and whether it has a positive effect on convergence speed/generalization vs. the increase in runtime?
2. How did you decide on 10 and 1 gradient ascent steps, respectively, for the experiments?
3. Do you have any (preliminary) results on how teleportation affects generalization for other optimizers (e.g., AdaGrad, Adam, etc.)?
4. This question goes beyond the scope of the paper, but I would be interested in your opinion on [1] in light of your contribution, a recent paper which challenges the current view on the correlation between sharpness and generalization.
