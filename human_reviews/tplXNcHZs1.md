- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 10, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in generating high-dimensional data like images, videos and audio. These models provide powerful data priors that can solve linear inverse problems in zero shot through Bayesian posterior sampling.
However, exact posterior sampling for diffusion models is intractable. Current solutions often hinge on approximations that are either computationally expensive or lack strong theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce an efficient diffusion sampling algorithm for linear inverse problems that is guaranteed to be asymptotically accurate. We reveal a link between Bayesian posterior sampling and Bayesian filtering in diffusion models, proving the former as a specific instance of the latter. Our method, termed filtering posterior sampling, leverages sequential Monte Carlo methods to solve the corresponding filtering problem. It seamlessly integrates with all Markovian diffusion samplers, requires no model re-training, and guarantees accurate samples from the Bayesian posterior as particle counts rise. Empirical tests demonstrate that our method generates better or comparable results than leading zero-shot diffusion posterior samplers on tasks like image inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring.

### Summary
This paper provides a link between Bayesian posterior sampling and Bayesian filtering in diffusion models for linear inverse problems. In general, exact posterior sampling is intractable. To overcome this difficulty, this paper introduces a diffusion process to the measurement vector and incorporates the information of the measurement by Bayesian filtering methods in the backward process.  In the ideal case, the exactness of the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed, which is realized by the sequential Monte Carlo method using infinitely many particles. Numerical experiments show that the performance of the method is as good as those of the SOTA methods.

### Strengths
This article provides an important perspective that has been missing until now for the linear inverse problem using diffusion models. The proposed method is reasonable in the Bayesian framework, and achieves as good performance as the current SOTA methods.

### Weaknesses
Extendability to nonlinear measurement cases is not clear. FPS-SMC, which uses multiple particles, requires considerably heavy computational cost.

### Questions
It is possible to extend the proposed method for nonlinear measurement cases?

### Summary
This paper proposed a filtering perspective on the linear inverse problem with diffusion models, which yields a novel FPS algorithm. Moreover, this paper gave a theoretical proof that that the FPS algorithm correctly samples from the Bayesian posterior
distribution as the number of particles approaches infinity.

### Strengths
1. A novel filtering perspective on solving linear inverse problems using diffusion models, which is interesting and inspiring.
2. A theoretical proof is given that the FPS algorithm can correctly sample from the Bayesian posterior
distribution as the number of particles approaches infinity.

### Weaknesses
1. Compared to previous methods like DPS (in fact, currently, DPS is no longer the SOTA), the improvement seems marginal in some cases, and even worse in some cases like inpainting. From my understanding, inpainting is among the most challenging tasks for linear image restoration tasks and the inferiority of FPS might suggest some underlying unaddressed problem for this proposed method.

2. There is a lack of complexity or running time analysis. How fast is FPS compared with other methods? How does the time increase with a different number of particles M?

### Questions
1. How did you add noise with standard deviation \sigma= 0.05? Did you account for the scaling of [-1, 1] so that the actual standard deviation added is 2 * \sigma=  0.05*2 = 1, as did in DDRM? The code is not provided so that I cannot check this point.

### Summary
This work introduces an efficient, asymptotically accurate diffusion sampling algorithm for linear inverse problems, linking Bayesian posterior sampling to Bayesian filtering in diffusion models, using sequential Monte Carlo methods for filtering, requiring no model re-training, and outperforming or matching existing methods in tasks like image inpainting, super-resolution, and motion deblur.

### Strengths
Solving inverse problems is a fundamental problem in machine learning and other fields. Diffusion models have a good potential to solve those problems, and it is a good attempts to provide a solution based on the filtering perspective.

### Weaknesses
The literature review for diffusion-based inverse problems are quite limited. It would be very important to compare with previous work to demonstrate the advantage and necessity of the new algorithm.

The scale of empirical experiments are relatively small.

### Questions
Is there a running time or NFE evaluation for the algorithm? 

Although the algorithm is designed to solve linear inverse problems, does it work on non-linear ones, which may happen in real practice? For DPS, they have shown the possibilities to solve nonlinear problems.

### Summary
This paper presents an SMC algorithm for sampling from the posterior of an inverse problem where the prior distribution distribution is a diffusion model, which is a natural way of sampling from the posterior of the diffusion model, due to the sequential structure of the sampling procedure. The resulting procedure does not require any additional training and, as claimed by the authors, samples from the posterior in the limit of infinite particles.

### Strengths
- The proposed method provides impressive results on inpainting tasks. Interestingly, other methods for inpainting with a diffusion prior often suffer from inconsistencies at the the borders of the patch. This is not the case of this method.

### Weaknesses
- I believe that method proposed in the paper is technically flawed. In the section 3 of the main paper, the authors give the state space model that they consider where notably, the use the same noise at step $k$ for both the observation and the state. They then proceed to claim that it holds that $p(x_0 | y_0) = \int p(x_0 | y_{0:N}) p(y_{1:N} | y_0) \mathrm{d}y_{1:N}$ and thus, to sample from $p(x_0 | y_0)$ it is enough to sample $p(y_{1:N} | y_0)$ and then sample from $p(x_0 | y_{0:n})$ using an SMC algorithm. However, this is not correct since $p(x_0 | y_{0:N}) = p(x_0 | y_0)$ for the state model that they consider. To show that this is the case, consider the case $N=1$. Then, the joint distribution of the SSM they consider is the following, since they share the noise: 
$$
p(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) = p(y_0 | x_0) p(x_0) \int p(\mathrm{d} z) \delta_{a_1 x_0 + b_1 z} (x_1)   \delta_{a_1 y_0 + b_1 A z} (y_1)
$$
and thus, 
$$
p(x_0 | y_{0:1}) = \frac{\int p(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) \mathrm{d} x_{1}}{\int p(y_{0:1}, x_{0:1}) \mathrm{d} x_{1} \mathrm{d} x_0} = \frac{p(y_0 | x_0) p(x_0) p(y_1 | y_0)}{\int p(y_0 | x_0) p(x_0) p(y_1 | y_0) \mathrm{d} x_0} = p(x_0 | y_0)
$$
Besides this fact, the methodology developed in the rest of the paper does not in fact sample from the correct posterior asymptotically. To see why this is the case, note that the state space model on which the authors apply SMC is the following: 
$$ 
p_\theta(x_{0:N}, y_{0:N}) = p_N(y_N | x_N) p_N(x_N) \prod_{s = 0}^{N-1} p_\theta(x_s | x_{s+1}) p(y_s | x_s) 
$$ 
It is straightforward to see that the p_\theta(x_0 | y_0) resulting from this model is **not** the target posterior $p^*(x_0 | y_0) \propto p(y_0 | x_0) p_\theta(x_0)$.  

- The idea of using the same noise for the forward process and the observations is not new and is used in [1], which the authors cite but they fail to mention that they use the same idea. The authors also fail to mention author work on SMC applied to diffusion posterior sampling [2]. In fact in this paper the authors use a specific decomposition of the posterior, similar to what is claimed in the text box at the end of the section 3 of this paper. In contrast, their decomposition is theoretically justified but holds under stringent assumptions on the backward process, further confirming that what is claimed in this paper is not true. 

- Finally, this paper is not the first one to develop a consistent diffusion posterior sampling algorithm, see [3] and [4] which develop **principled** SMC algorithms for asympotitcally exact posterior sampling. This is not a criticism, as these papers have been released 3/4 months ago and I understand that the authors may not have had knowledge of them.
