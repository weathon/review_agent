# Neurosymbolic Grounding for Compositional World Models

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We introduce Cosmos, a framework for object-centric world modeling that is designed for compositional generalization (CompGen), i.e., high performance on unseen input scenes obtained through the composition of known visual "atoms." The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic grounding. Specifically, the framework introduces two new tools: (i) neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through an evaluation that considers two different forms of CompGen on an established blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for CompGen in world modeling.

### Summary
The authors proposed a framework for object-centric world modeling in compositional generalization settings. They propose a neuro-symbolic scene encoding, consisting of real vectors and vectors of symbols describing attributes, as well as a neuro-symbolic attention mechanism, which binds entities to rules of interaction. They use foundation models to extract each entity’s symbolic attributes, and show their method’s performance on a block-pushing domain.

### Strengths
I am appreciative of the neural-symbolic attention mechanism, computed between ordered symbolic and neural rule encodings to determine the most applicable rule-slot pair. I also appreciate that this is end-to-end differentiable as a permutation equivariant action attention module. Using a frozen foundation model to capture the symbolic attributes in the scene encodings is also a simple but elegant way of decomposing entities into attributes.

### Weaknesses
W1. I am not convinced that the proposed neuro-symbolic scene encoding is the optimal formulation. I would have appreciated ablations in this paper, including ones that explored whether or not having both real vectors and a vector of symbolic attributes is actually helpful. What should the real vector capture that the symbolic attribute is not capturing, especially given that the rules of the evaluation domain seem to only rely on these attributes?

W2. An additional note is that I would have appreciated more clarity of what information is given to the model, and whether other methods have access to the same information. From my understanding, a strong assumption is that the symbolic labeling module requires a predefined list of attributes that is important for the downstream task. I think in many downstream tasks this may not be reasonable to know a priori. Potentially, you can run experiments showing that with a superset of attributes, directly predicted by some foundation model, that you can still learn the correct correspondence to rules given this noise. 

W3. Similarly, are there assumptions made on how many rules there are in the evaluation domain? I understand that the rule is a learnable encoding, but is the amount of rules learned as well? One can imagine that the method discovers rules that are correct, but not optimal (e.g., decompose rules into many smaller rules that overfit to the train set). 

W4. I would have appreciated evaluation on a different domain, such as maybe Physion, and learn more complex and less obvious rules such as rigid and soft-body collisions, stable multi-object configurations, etc. In the block-pushing domain, it seems like the rules are tied to clear attributes such as shape and color, without having to further learn whether non-uniform combinations of these would lead to certain downstream effects. Also related to the known attributes assumption in W2.

### Questions
Q1. Can you clarify how SAM is used with ResNet to produce a set-structured hidden representation for each object? 

Q2. Is there a way to interpret the learned rules and qualitatively see how well it aligns with the ground truth rules?

### Summary
This paper presents a neurosymbolic approach to learning a transition model in the pixel space. The proposed model, namely Cosmos, takes in the current state as an image, the action (encoded as one-hot vectors), and predicts the next state. The model is trained on a dataset of state-action-state transition tuples and evaluated on unseen state-action combinations. The model focuses on two types of compositional generalization tests: scene composition and object composition.

### Strengths
This paper tackles an important problem that is interesting to the ICLR community, specifically learning world models from pixels. The overall presentation of the paper is good. The organization of the method section clearly illustrates the number of modules in the system and how they are connected with each other, which is obviously helpful for readers. The description of experimental setups is clear, and the authors have done a sufficient number of ablation studies and comparisons with baselines.

### Weaknesses
There are two main weaknesses of the paper.

First, the problem setting of object composition seems very contrived to me, for two reasons.
- In the physical world, it is unclear what's a concrete example where such kind of metarules would apply. In particular, the authors are training the model on seeing two red blocks moving together and two green blocks moving together, and hope that the model would generalize to predict two blue blocks would also move together. Such kind of "attribute-relationship" based generalization doesn't seem natural to me. Arguably, this kind of generalization can be dangerous: two blocks can be stacked together; two cylinders can be stacked together, but not two spheres, in the physical world.
- There is some serious machine learning identifiability issue with this setting. If the model does not have inductive biases in training, there is no way that it can generalize.
--- Based on these two concerns, the arguments around object compositional generalization is weak.

Second, the model is only trained and evaluated on a fairly toy environment, and the downstream application to planning is only shown in a very simple setting. It is unclear how this approach can be generalized to more complicated scenarios.

Slightly minor is that the paper missed some important related work along the direction of learning neuro-symbolic transition models. For example,
- PDSketch: Integrated Planning Domain Programming and Learning https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05501
- Learning Object-Oriented Dynamics for Planning from Text https://openreview.net/forum?id=B6EIcyp-Rb7

They are not exactly the same setting but a lot of the high-level ideas are definitely the same, including learning lifted transition rules, using factorized embeddings (colors, shapes, etc.) to represent objects.

While I overall like the presentation of the paper---it's well-organized and overall good. I found the description of some details very unclear. In particular:
- Page 3, the object composition part. I have to check the appendix and read through paragraphs/figures several times in order to understand what this object composition means. I think the name is not very descriptive. The authors should consider change it to a better name that describes such kind of "metarules" (e.g., two objects have relations if they share the same color) and present concrete examples in the main text.
- Parge 4-5: the authors should keep the "..." in the sets. Otherwise it's very confusing to look at "{c1, c2, cp}"
- The writing of the method section could be further improved by having a running example (and referring back to this example in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3).

Finally, the paper does not have a limitation discussion section.

Minor notes on the writing: I think using CG as an acronym for "compositional generalization" is a bit uncommon. The term is easily confused with other concepts like "computer graphics."

### Questions
I don't have particular questions. Please address the missing related works; and consider reframing and better illustrating the object compositional generalization.

### Summary
This paper proposed COSMOS framework for compositional generalization in world modeling, that involves a blend of neural and symbolic representations to understand scene entities and their interactions.

### Strengths
1.     This paper proposes an end-to-end differentiable framework with a novel neuro-symbolic attention
2.	This is a well written and well-structured paper.
3.	Most of the traditional neuro-symbolic methods map the representations to symbol manually while this paper does it without any manual effort

### Weaknesses
1.	The effectiveness of the framework might be constrained dealing with larger and more complex real-world scenarios. Since scalability of neuro-symbolic methods are required to handle more diverse environments.
2.	When the model will encounter with noisy or incomplete input, how will the model perform?
3.	Combining neural and symbolic inputs might be computationally heavy, but there is no significant discussion about the computational complexity.
4.	Although the model showcases strong performance in the 2D block pushing domain with MSE but that’s not the case for MRR and Eq.MRR always. More experimental results are required to establish this as the new state-of-the-art.

5. There are typos in introduction section.
