## Abstract
Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot performance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks such as VQAv2 and OK-VQA, alluding to their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, the benchmarks being used have questions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps, and also conflate visual reasoning with world knowledge. Consequently, it remains unclear whether a VLM’s apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its world knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities. Hence, we systematically examine and benchmark the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps. We specifically focus on zero-shot reasoning rather than few-shot or fine-tuned approaches to gain clearer insights into the inherent capabilities of the models, without additional influence of task-specific training data. We design novel scene-informed prompting techniques and focus on two novel aspects of zero-shot visual reasoning: i) evaluating the impact of conveying visual scene information as either visual embeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large language model (LLM) of the VLM, and ii) comparing the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting to standard prompting for zero-shot visual reasoning. Notably, we find that: i) the underlying LLMs of VLMs when provided only ground-truth textual scene descriptions, consistently perform better in comparison to being provided visual embeddings, particularly achieving ∼18% higher accuracy on the PTR dataset, and ii) CoT prompting performs marginally better than standard prompting only for the comparatively large GPT-3.5-Turbo (175B) model, and does worse for smaller-scale models. This suggests the emergence of CoT abilities for visual reasoning in LLMs at larger scales even when world knowledge is limited. Overall, we find limitations in the reasoning capabilities of VLMs and LLMs for more complex visual reasoning, and highlight the important role that LLMs can play in visual reasoning.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper systematically studies and compares the performance of LLMs and VLMs on visual reasoning problems using two synthetic datasets. The main findings are: 1. LLMs provided with ground-truth textual scene information perform better than those provided with visual embeddings. 2. CoT only helps when the scale of the LLMs is large enough. 3. They also analyze how the number of “reasoning steps”, question types, and model scale affect the performance.

### Strengths
1. This is the first work to test VLMs and LLMs in visual reasoning tasks. It performs detailed experiments and analysis on both VLMs and LLMs models. 
2. The study is meaningful and provides some reference for both research in visual reasoning tasks and LLMs and LVLMs.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper only studies one LVLMs (BLIP-2 FlanT5), the conclusions may not generalized to more recent LVLMs such as LLAVA and InstructBLIP.
2. Some results and analysis are not very inspiring: E.g. 1. It is reasonable and not surprising that for synthetic visual reasoning tasks, providing ground truth metadata to LLMs is better than visual embedding processed by the model since ground truth metadata contains all the required information to reason the answer. 2. The observation that larger LLMs perform better using chain-of-thought has been discovered by prior work [1].
3. The conclusion in the paragraph **Drawbacks of current VLM Architecture** is not well supported by the experiments. Instead, they are more like some hypothesis.

### Questions
1. When providing explanations for the experiment result, the reviewer think it is better to provide some qualitative examples to support it. E.g. 'One possible explanation is that the objects in PTR are more complex, with multiple parts, hence the task for the VLM’s visual frontend is more challenging, and more errors and uncertainty are introduced.'

### Summary
This article systematically examine and benchmark the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps.

### Strengths
In my opinion, the most captivating aspect of this article is systematically examine and benchmark the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge. It can effectively separates actual visual reasoning capabilities from vast amounts of world knowledge obtained in VLM pre-training. Furthermore, the experimental strategy design is reasonable.

### Weaknesses
While the initial insight is intriguing, as mentioned above, the experimental section falls short in effectively supporting the current viewpoints and uncovering more compelling conclusions. However, in the Chapter 5 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK, authors demonstrate a clear understanding of their weaknesses and identify the improvements of their research.

### Questions
As mentioned above, I suggest that the authors further explore more varied visual reasoning tasks and evaluate the latest extensive VLM models on more datasets unrelated to world knowledge. While the initial insight is valid and the experimental strategy design is soundness, the execution and argumentation are lacking. If the authors address the points raised in the Chapter 5 and conduct a more comprehensive analysis to determine if VLM possesses genuine visual reasoning capabilities, I believe this work will generate significant interest within the VLM community. However, at its current stage, I find the work to be insufficient.

## Human Reviewer 3

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper is a straightforward investigation of two things. First, whether VLMs can outperform the corresponding LLMs they bootstrap from. Second, whether chain-of-thought prompting (“let’s think step by step…”) helps LLMs on structured visual understanding tasks (on CLEVR and PTR).

### Strengths
**Writing**:
- The writing is easy to follow which is great.
- The related work section is mostly thorough.

**Results of interest**:
1. That VLM performance could be lower than LLM performance on a visual task is somewhat surprising.
2. In the CoT analysis: that Flan-T5 outperforms GPT-3.5 consistently is also surprising.

### Weaknesses
**Criticisms/questions**:
1. Are the VLMs and LLMs directly comparable? The VLMs only bootstrap from the pretrained LLMs. But after training, there’s not much reason for them to be comparable.
2. If they are directly comparable, why is VLM performance lower than LLM performance even when the VLMs have the scene metadata? They should be able to zero-out the contribution of the visual modality in each case. That should permit them to perform as well as language-only reasoning.
3. Figure 2: to study scaling laws we need more than 2 datapoints. Given the BLIP family only offers two models, it could be useful to consider other model families. We'll also need error bars.

**Writing**:
- The paper could use some more sign-posting (e.g., there’s nothing to introduce Section 4).
- Some sections are really large (e.g., Section 4.1) and could be structured better.
- Figure captions could be better/more informative (e.g., Figure 5 refers to a “top row” and “bottom row” which are hard to find.)
- With some compression (e.g., figures) the paper could fit 7 pages perhaps.

Please see weaknesses above, which I've tried to frame as questions.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper analyzes Vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) on zero-shot visual reasoning. To minimize the impact of background knowledge on the inference result, the authors chose synthetic datasets including CLEVR and PTR. The main findings are: (1) LLMs are better than VLMs on average; (2) chain-of-thought is helpful only on 175B parameter GPT model.

### Strengths
- The choice of using synthetic data to focus on reasoning ability is well-motivated.
- Performance analysis based on reasoning step, question family, model size, sheds some light on the behavior of VLMs and LLMs.
- Performance was measured on GPT and FLAN-T5 across different parameter scale.

### Weaknesses
- The paper has some interesting observations and hypothesis. However, majority of them are not backed up by experiments.
For example, for the claim "visual information querying, where the model’s visual frontend extracts scene
details based on an initial text query," more evidence is appreciated. If this is indeed the case, the authors should try modifying initial text query to extract richer visual information. Another ways is leveraging a feedback loop as authors metioned as done in works like:
(1) Haoxuan You et al., "IdealGPT: Iteratively Decomposing Vision and Language Reasoning via Large Language Models" (2) Kaiwen Zhou et al., "ViCor: Bridging Visual Understanding and Commonsense Reasoning with Large Language Models"

Authors also should explore alternative possibilities such as scene information extracted by VLMs being incorrect.
- Lacking insights. The authors classified the problems by # reasoning steps, question family (exist, count, etc). Why and how LLMs fail on these categories? Also, how LLMs compare on these categories compared to more traditional methods such as neuro-symbolic reasoners for CLEVR dataset? Are there any characteristic of visual reasoning problems that poses challenges to VLMs?
- Only one kind of VLM is used. Hence, the conclusion from the current results may not generalize to other VLMs.
- Writing and presentation could have been significantly improved. For example, figures could be condensed into numerical numbers in Tables.

### Questions
