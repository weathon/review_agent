## Abstract
Domain shift degrades classification models on new data distributions. Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn features that bridge labeled source and unlabeled target domains. In contrast to feature learning, gradual domain adaptation (GDA) leverages extra continuous intermediate domains with pseudo-labels to boost the source classifier. However, real intermediate domains are sometimes unavailable or ineffective. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{G}$radual Domain Adaptation via $\textbf{G}$radient $\textbf{F}$low (GGF) to generate intermediate domains with preserving labels, thereby enabling us a fine-tuning method for GDA. We employ the Wasserstein gradient flow in Kullback–Leibler divergence to transport samples from the source to the target domain. To simulate the dynamics, we utilize the Langevin algorithm. Since the Langevin algorithm disregards label information and introduces diffusion noise, we introduce classifier-based and sample-based potentials to avoid label switching and dramatic deviations in the sampling process. For the proposed GGF model, we analyze its generalization bound. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GGF method compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Summary
The manuscript introduces a novel approach for generative gradual domain adaptation, termed Gradual Domain Adaptation via Gradient Flow (GGF). This method produces intermediate domain data and iteratively adapts classifiers through a sequence of these intermediate domains. The core concept involves creating intermediate domains between the source and target domains by optimizing a Wasserstein gradient flow to reduce distribution discrepancies. The gradient flow specifically aims to minimize three energies (which the Wasserstein gradient flow is decomposed into): 
i) a distribution-related energy for aligning source features with the target
ii) a classifier-related energy to maintain label integrity
iii) a sample-related energy to attenuate noise. 

This facilitates the incremental adaptation of the source classifier to the target domain via fine-tuning processes. The authors offer a theoretical framework to constrain the target error based on the properties of the gradient flow. The efficacy of GGF is supported through extensive experiments on standard Domain Adaptation benchmarks.

### Strengths
+ [**Novelty**] The idea of connecting gradual domain adaptation (GDA) and Wasserstein gradient flow is natural, given that previous works have already developed theories of GDA with Wasserstein distance. However, the decomposition of Wasserstein gradient flow into three energy terms by [Santambrogio, 2017] is less known in the machine learning community. The authors managed to apply this decomposition to the GDA problem in a non-trivial way: they relate each energy term with some machine learning notion, and find proper ML loss terms as proxies for these energy terms.

+ [**Theoretical Guarantee**] The theoretical analysis grounds the approach well by providing insight into properties like transport cost and label preservation that are useful for analyzing GDA. Bounding the target error connects the gradient flow construction to actual adaptation performance. This helps justify design choices made in GGF.

+ [**Extensive Experiments**] The method is general and can work with different base classifiers and DA techniques that provide feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including rotated MNIST, Portraits and Office-Home demonstrate clear improvements over prior arts. The consistent gains across tasks highlight the effectiveness of GGF.

+ [**Visualization**] I quite appreciate the visualizations in Fig. 1, 2, 4, which illustrate the proposed method clearly.

### Weaknesses
+ [**No Explanation of the Original Energy Decomposition**] The algorithm is motivated by [Santambrogio, 2017]'s decomposition of Wasserstein gradient flow into three energy terms. However, the authors only describe them as "internal, (external) potential, and interaction energy" without demonstrating their specific definitions. It would be more convincing if the authors can list the original definitions of the energy terms and compare the deviation of their designed loss terms from the original terms.

+ [**Too Many Hyperparameters** ] The loss has three terms, each with a learning rate; there is also an `alpha` term and a `T` term as hyper-parameters. Overall, I feel the number of hyper-parameters is a little high, which may makes the algorithm harder to apply in practice.

+ [**Number of Intermediate Domains should be varied for fair comparison**] In Sec. 5.2, the authors show the improvement of their proposed GGF over GOAT & CNF on the Portraits dataset in Fig. 3. However, the number of intermediate domains in Fig. 3 is fixed to 19. For the GOAT algorithm, its authors demonstrate that the optimal number of intermediate domains for GOAT is below 5, and more intermediate domains may harm its performance. The current choice of 19 intermediate domains might be optimal for GGF, but not for GOAT. So I urge the authors to compare GGF vs. GOAT/CNF across various numbers of intermediate domains (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16).

### Questions
+ [**UDA Experiment Lacks Explanation**] The experiment on Office-Home (shown in Table 2) shows "RSDA+GGF" and "CoVi+GGF" without explanation. I know CoVi also (implicitly) generates intermediate domains. How do you apply GGF on top of these methods? The paper lacks a detailed explanation of your experimental protocols here.

### Summary
This paper introduces Gradual Domain Adaptation via Gradient Flow (GGF) to generate intermediate domains (when they are not given), which are then used for the fine-tuning process of a gradual domain adaptation (GDA) setting. In the proposed GGF method, feature representations from the source domain are gradually transported to the target domain by using a Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) that aims to minimize the following three designed energies: distribution-based energy, classifier-based energy, and sample-based energy. In addition, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization bound. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed GGF method compared to other current baselines.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and relatively easy to follow. The idea of generating (synthetic) intermediate domains with preserving labels is novel and interesting.  I appreciate the authors' effort to provide a theoretical guarantee of a target error-bound of the proposed GGF.

### Weaknesses
1. Regarding the proposed method, can the authors provide an estimation of the sufficient number of the intermediate domains $T$ to obtain a pre-defined target performance? What happens when $T \to \infty$?

2. Current experimental results of the paper are supportive and promising, but not very convincing. In particular,

- Lack the empirical comparison with the very related baseline [A] in both Tables 1 & 2. 

- Currently, the experiment results can only show the benefit of GGF when applying for two baselines (including RSDA and Covi). I am curious how GGF can be combined with others mentioned in the paper.

- GGF seems to be a time-consuming. Comparison regarding the running time with other mentioned baselines?

Clarification: 
1. In Fig. 1, the transformation from the source to the target is performed in the latent space, while everything in the paper is about the original data $x$. Could you please clarify that?

2. The proposed method relies on the labeling function $f$ for each domain, while we do not have access to the labels of target samples in a general UDA framework. Could you please comment on this?

3. Could you please double-check the last equality in Eq. (5). It seems the integral over $\mu_t$ term was missed.

### Summary
This paper studies the gradual domain adaptation problem. It leverages gradient flow analysis for generating intermediate domains between the source and target domain to facilitate the adaptation. The proposed approach consists of three main components: (i) A distribution based loss function that transports source features to target ones. (ii) A classifier based regularizer to preserve the label information while transporting the features. (iii) sample based noise reduction regularizer. The proposed approach is supported both theoretically and experimentally where performance gains are consistent.

### Strengths
The main strengths of this work are:

(1) The paper is fairly well-written. 

(2) The proposed approach is novel and theoretically supported.

(3) The experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
While I am not an expert in this field, I would recommend/suggest the following for improving the paper:

1) The methodology section needs some elaboration for better readability. How are the score networks trained? The same question goes to the rectified flow $\nu_\theta$.

2) The theoretical analysis, while supporting the proposed approach, seem not related to the experiments conducted in section 5. I would recommend investing some space in the main paper for implementation details and computational burdens.

3) Regarding the experiments: The following experiments are missing from the main work:

(3a) Hyperparameter ablations: While Table 3 shows the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach, sensitivity analysis with regard to $\eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3, \lambda$ are missing.

(3b) While GGF showed enhanced performance when combined with two approaches (Cove and RSDA), it is important to compare different methods in terms of runtime and computational overhead.

(3c) Experiments on more challenging datasets such as DomainNet and ImageNet-C where domain shifts are more severe.

### Questions
In addition to the points raised in the weaknesses, I have the following question:

1) From the methodology part, can you explain how is the combined approach in section 3.1 and 3.2 related to the Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance [A]?

### Summary
The work proposes a gradual domain adaptation method that improves classification results. The method applies Wasserstein gradient flow to minimize a novel energy function. The samples from the source distribution flow gradually to the target distribution by multiple intermediate domains. The experiments show that the classification accuracies are comparable to current classification methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is novel in terms of minimizing an energy function and using that to help a classification task.
2. The writing is clear and the paper is easy to follow.
3. The paper conducts several experiments and numerical comparisons to show that the classification results are comparable with other methods.

### Weaknesses
1. In Table 2, it looks like the results are only the best accuracy for three tasks.
2. In Figure 1, it is a bit unclear what the source distribution and target distribution are. Are they both portraits but only the source distribution has labels? It would be more clear if you defne what are $\mu_t, \pi$, such as writing them as metrics based on $x,y$.
3. We recommend the authors cite the following two recent works on MMD and gradient flow:

Fan, J. and Alvarez-Melis, D., 2023. Generating synthetic datasets by interpolating along generalized geodesics. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.06866.

Hua, X., Nguyen, T., Le, T., Blanchet, J. and Nguyen, V.A., 2023. Dynamic Flows on Curved Space Generated by Labeled Data. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.00061.

### Questions
1. Do you make assumptions about how the distributions look like and if the source and target distributions are close?
2. The accuracies grow as the energy is minimized. Is there a way to measure the quality of the flowed images, both qualitatively or using some metrics like FID?
3. Is it possible to use the Wasserstein distance in the distance-based energy?
