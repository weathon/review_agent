## Abstract
Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns *scores* or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.

### Summary
This paper formulates the offline goal conditioned reinforcement leanring (GCRL) problem as an occupancy matching problem and leverages the popular DICE methods to transform this problem into an objective that can be exclusively trained on offline dataset. Specifically, they adopts ValueDICE[1]-like method for this reformulation. The authors argue that by doing so, the offline GCRL problem can be solved without necessitating a well-trained discriminator. Instead, it learns unnormalized densities or scores that allow it to produce optimal goal-reaching policies, greatly enhancing the training results. In addition, this paper does not directly optimize the objectives derived from the DICE reformulation (Eq. 9), but adopts IQL[2] to optimize some surrogate objectives (Eq. 10-12). From my perspective, this approach mitigates the side-effect of residual learning in Eq. 9 since the surrogate objective in Eq. 11 is optimized via semi-gradient, which is believed to enjoy better performances than residual learning. This paper conducts some experiments on low-dimensional and image-based tasks to support the effectiveness of the proposed method, and also carries out some ablation stuidies on stochastic environments with varied noise levels.

### Strengths
1. Despite GoFAR[3] already employing DICE methods to address offline GCRL problem, this paper is the first to eliminate the need for an additional discriminator.
2. The experimental results are promising, outperforming baselines (especially the most related GoFAR[3]) across a wide range of evaluation settings.

### Weaknesses
## Problem formulation
1. The target goal-transition distribution $q(s,a,g)$ defined in Section 3.1 might not be a valid discounted visitation distribution that fulfills the Bellman-flow constraint. Therefore, this suggests that the  occupancy matching problem in Eq. 4 may not be appropriately formulated.

## Experiment
2. This paper optimizes surrogate objectives using IQL[2] rather than directly solving the objective derived from DICE reformulation, but does not provide explainations for this choice. Moreover, this paper does not conduct enough ablation studies on this aspect. It raises a question about the performance of GoFAR using this same technique. In my view, optimizing the surrogate objectives in Eq. 10-12 can mitigate the side-effect of residual learning in Eq. 9. Therefore, GoFAR may also obtain large performance gains using the IQL tricks.
3. Given that GoFAR does not employ IQL surrogate objectives, I cannot ensure the comparison in Figure 2 is fair. It would be more fair if the authors could also apply this technique to GoFAR and compare it against GoFAR using this approach.

## Others
4. Some potential overclaims. Section 3.1 is essentially an extension of the conclusion of GoFAR[3] from state-occupancy matching to state-action-occupancy matching. The authors should provide more discussions on the relationships with GoFAR. Although they have made statements like "Proposition 1 extends the insights of formulating GCRL as an imitation learning problem from Ma et al. for goal-transition distributions when matching state-action-goal visitations", this similarity should be made clearer.
5. The Problem Formulation section (Section 2) is largely similar to the one in GoFAR[3] paper, with only minor rewording. In my view, this section should be reorganized or rewording a lot to avoid potential plagiarism.

### Summary
This paper proposes an offline GCRL algorithm from the occupancy matching perspective. The problem setting basically follows GoFAR [1], using a similar DICE-based construction. The difference is that GoFAR is formulated as a V-DICE (learn V and perform goal-conditioned state occupancy matching) and does not use HER; while this paper adopts Q-DICE (learn both Q and $\pi$ by solving a max-min problem, and performs goal-conditioned state-action occupancy matching) and uses HER to generate desirable goal-reaching data ($q(s,a,g)$). The tricky part is that the final practical algorithm is essentially a goal-conditioned version of in-sample learning algorithm which bears lots of similarities with methods like IQL[2], SQL/EQL[3], and XQL[4]. Although such in-sample learning algorithms like SQL/EQL and XQL have been show to have some connection with DICE-based methods, there are some important distinctions. There are some noticeable theoretical gaps here. The proposed method has a number of strange design choices and the algorithm development is not very principled in several places. See the following strengths and weaknesses for detailed comments.

### Strengths
- The proposed practical algorithm provides a reasonable approach to combine goal-conditioning and in-sample learning offline RL.
- The performance is good in a number of GCRL tasks. The experiments are comprehensive.
- Provide experiments on vision-based tasks.

### Weaknesses
There are several key weaknesses in the paper.
- The problem setting and Section 3.1 largely follow GoFAR[1] with minor changes. A key motivation from the authors is that methods like GOFAR need an unstable discriminator-based construction. However, this does not really hold. As in the GoFAR paper[1], their authors clearly mentioned in the paper that the discriminator can be bypassed by using the reward in the dataset.
- Although using HER to generate augmented goal-transition samples could potentially improve distribution coverage and may contribute to certain level performance improvement. However, as discussed in GoFAR, using HER could also lead to sensitive hyperparameter tuning and suffer from hindsight bias.
- The biggest problem of this paper is the gap between theoretical derivation and the practical algorithm. Based on the augmented samples from HER, the proposed method constructs a goal-conditioned Q-DICE objective which needs to solve a max-$\pi$ and min-$S$ (analogous to Q function in typical Q-DICE algorithm like AlgaeDICE[5]). This actually caused some stability issues due to extracting $\pi$ through the max-min optimization problem. Hence the practical algorithm directly jumps to an in-sample learning framework which is similar to IQL[2], SQL/EQL[3], and XQL[4]. Although there are some connections between the DICE-based method and previous in-sample learning methods, there are also some distinctions. An apparent difference is that the DICE-based method requires minimizing $S$ (analogous to Q in other Q-DICE methods) in the first term of Eq.(9) using samples from initial states $d_0$, while in in-sample learning algorithms, this can be sampled from the whole dataset $\mathcal{D}$ (Eq.(10)). Second, DICE-based method only learn Q (similar to S in this paper) or V, while the previous in-sample learning algorithms learn both Q and V. In my opinion, the paper starts with a DICE formulation and goes a long way to turn it into a non-DICE algorithm. If the authors check the SQL/EQL[3] paper, a more straightforward approach will be starting with its implicit value regularization framework and designing a proper, goal-conditioned regularization function $f$, which will provide a neat and more principled algorithm.
- The proposed algorithm has many hyperparameters, e.g. $\tau$ in Eq.(10), $\beta$ in Eq.(11), and $\alpha$ in Eq.(12). The paper conducts heavy tuning to obtain the best performance. First of all, for an offline RL algorithm, introducing too many hyperparameters and requiring heavy parameter tuning is an extremely bad practice. In practical offline RL applications, it is almost impossible to evaluate or tune model parameters given restricted access to the real environment. In practice, no one will use an offline RL algorithm if it needs careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve good performance.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for offline goal-conditioned RL, integrating occupancy matching with a convex dual formulation so that the learning objective is converted for better leveraging on suboptimal offline data. Instead of behavior cloning, contrastive RL, or RL with sparse reward, the proposed method is built upon the direction of occupancy matching but without learning an additional discriminator. The proposed method is supported by theorems and evaluated with comprehensive simulation experiments.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written, and the concepts are clearly and concisely explained
* The authors provide theoretical contributions.
* The paper's contributions are supported by empirical analyses on a range of benchmarks, demonstrating the advantage of using SMORe for suboptimal offline data, especially the evaluation of robustness and high-dimensional observation space.

### Weaknesses
* Could you please elaborate more about the technical differences between SMORe and GoFAR? My understanding is that the main difference is whether the training involved a discriminator. Does any other difference in details improve the novelty of SMORe?

### Questions
* Is the "0.25" in equation 9 a fixed number or a kind of coefficient that can be tuned? 

* Any reason why you make the mixture of random/medium and expert data following 4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP?  I thought that there is already a pipeline for collecting random, medium, and expert sub-dataset?

* Can you explain why SMORe has an even higher discounted return in Figure 2 under 0.5 noise level compared with 0 noise? In addition, I am interested in the variance of Figure 2.

* Is there any insight or analysis into why pick and place tasks in Figure 3 are relatively difficult for other baselines compared with the remaining tasks while the proposed method can have a significant improvement in pick and place tasks?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, known as SMORe, which is derived from a mixture-distribution matching perspective and eliminates the need for learning a discriminator. The paper demonstrates that SMORe outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and clearly motivates the problem of offline GCRL. It uses convex duality theory to derive a dual optimization problem that can use offline data to learn score functions and policies, which provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method. It also presents extensive empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SMORe on challenging benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
One weakness of the paper is that the claim of being discriminator-free is somewhat overclaiming. From Eq. 12, the S-function can be seen as a Q-function and the M-function can be seen as a V-function. In this case, although the framework does not have an explicit discriminator, the S-function actually plays the role of a discriminator. What's more, the proposed method requires two networks, S and M, to learn the optimal policy, while many works only require a network (such as contrastive RL). This implies that the proposed method has more parameters and computational complexity.
Another weakness is that it is unclear how much of the performance gain comes from each component. A possible suggestion is to add an experiment without using expectile regression and AWR, as well as experiments that show how they work separately. This would clarify the role of each part in the proposed method.

### Questions
Why do the WGCSL and GCSL methods have similar performance in Table 7-10, while show a large difference in Table 1 for the following four environments: CheetahTgtVel-m-e, CheetahTgtVel-r-e, AntTgtVel-m-e and AntTgtVel-r-e? What factors could explain this discrepancy?
