## Abstract
Deep Learning algorithms have recently gained significant attention due to their impressive performance. However, their high complexity and un-interpretable mode of operation hinders their confident deployment in real-world safety-critical tasks. This work targets *ante hoc* interpretability, and specifically Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs). Our goal is to design a framework that admits a highly interpretable decision making process with respect to human understandable concepts, on *multiple levels of granularity. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical concept discovery formulation leveraging: (i) recent advances in image-text models, and (ii) an innovative formulation for *multi-level concept selection* via data-driven and sparsity inducing Bayesian arguments. Within this framework, concept information does not solely rely on the similarity between the *whole* image and general *unstructured* concepts; instead, we introduce the notion of *concept hierarchy* to uncover and exploit more granular concept information residing in *patch-specific* regions of the image scene. As we experimentally show, the proposed construction not only outperforms recent CBM approaches, but also yields a principled framework towards interpetability.

### Summary
This paper extends the concept bottleneck model (CBM) to develop a hierarchical concept concept discovery formulation. The proposed method leverages recent multimodal models such as CLIP and a multi-level concept selection algorithm. Different from CBMs, the authors claim that the proposed method can discover a hierarchy of concepts.

-----------After Rebuttal--------------

I have read the author response and other reviews. I would like to thank the authors for their response, which is helpful. However, my major concerns remain (e.g., in terms of novelty and the notion of high/low-level concepts). I would therefore keep my ratings unchanged. I would suggest that the authors make a stronger case in terms of where to draw the line between high- and low-level concepts and what their technical contributions are in their revision.

### Strengths
The notion of concept hierarchy seems interesting. 

The proposed method outperforms an adapted label-free version of CBM.

### Weaknesses
The motivation of low-level information does not seem very convincing to me. The authors argue that previous methods such as label-free CBM focus on only image-level concepts and therefore could lose fine-grained details in the image. However, one could also argue that the fine-grained details in the image are already well summarized into the image-level concepts. For example, the CUB dataset does contain a large number of low-level concepts (information) such as color and shape of birds’ parts. 

Equation 6 essentially introduces an additional gating mechanism to turn on/off different concepts. The key goal is to introduce sparsity of concept activation. While this make sense to me, why not use a simpler approach, e.g., sending S_H into another linear layer, followed by some L1 regularization? Would that work too?

The proposed method seems to heavily build on Panousis et al., 2023, introducing limited novelty. For example, the whole high-level concept discovery section is nearly identical to Panousis et al., 2023. For the low-level concept discovery, it is actually a simple adaptation, i.e., replacing the whole image in Equation (3-6) with each patch, resulting in Equation (7-9). The only difference is in the aggregation of the patch-level information and the link between both levels. 

The idea of using pretrained models like CLIP is not new either, with the baseline label-free CBMs as an example. 

The notation is a bit confusing. In Equation (7), does $[P]_n$ refer to the collection of all $P_n$ where $n$ goes from 1 to P? Or does it only refer to the $n$-th patch? Or does it refer to all patches from Image $n$? If it is the former, this is no different from Equation (3). Similar questions arise for Equation (8). What is $c$ in the size of $P_p$? Is it the number of image channels?

It is unclear how to draw the line between high-level concepts and low-level attributes. In Section 3.3 the authors mentioned *cat* as a high-level concept and *eggs* as low-level attributes. Why couldn’t *eggs* be a high-level concept? This also goes back to the motivation of introducing low-level concepts mentioned in the comments above. From Section 4, it seems the so-called *concept* is simply the class label and the low-level concepts are actually the commonly used *concept* in CUB/SUN? This does not make too much sense. 

In terms of performance, the proposed CPM underperforms CDM by a considerable margin on both CUB and SUN. Also, it is not fair to claim that label-free CBMs is not capable of concept discovery, since they do automatically discover concepts using CLIP. The only advantage is in terms of sparsity, which can actually be trivially enforced by additional sparsity constraints in label-free CBMs.

### Summary
This paper introduces a hierarchical approach to Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that aims to make decisions comprehensible at multiple levels of granularity. The proposed framework incorporates cutting-edge image-text models with a novel strategy for selecting multi-level concepts, employing Bayesian techniques to induce data sparsity. This method, instead of the conventional whole-image similarity approach, employs a concept hierarchy that targets specific regions of the image for granular concept analysis. The framework's effectiveness is backed by experimental results, showing superiority over existing CBM methods and advancing towards a principled path for interpretable models. The approach emphasizes both low-level and high-level concept discovery, using text and attributes for detailed image patch descriptions and classes for holistic image understanding. A linkage matrix, learned from the data, defines the interplay between these concept levels, resulting in a structured and interpretable model.

### Strengths
1-The paper is well-written, offering a clear explanation of the methods used.

2-It provides a well-articulated rationale for the method, with a clear linkage between the objectives and the loss functions employed.

3-The approach demonstrates good performance in identifying and interpreting low-level concepts within images.

### Weaknesses
1-The terminology 'hierarchical concept discovery' suggests multiple levels of conceptual granularity, yet the model only delineates high and low-level concepts. To accurately reflect the claimed hierarchy, the model should demonstrate an intermediate conceptual layer, at least within one dataset, to substantiate its hierarchical claims.

2-The distinction between this model and existing transformer-based methods, which also discern image attributes, is ambiguous. Both seem to analyze image patches and assign attributes, making it unclear about the novelty of the proposed approach.

3-The ablative studies provided are not comprehensive, particularly regarding the role and impact of the parameter $\epsilon$. A more detailed examination of this parameter's influence is warranted for a complete understanding of the model's behavior.

### Questions
1- Does Figure 1 accurately represent the relationship between high and low-level concepts as described by matrix $B$ in Equation 11 within your experimental results? Or is it to show the overall concept of the method?

2- Regarding Equation 13, could you elaborate on the process for determining the value of the hyperparameter $\epsilon$?

3- Table 1 presents a point of confusion; if CDM and CLIP yield superior classification accuracy, what is the advantage of employing hierarchical concepts as proposed in your methodology?

### Summary
This paper attempts to create interpretable image classifiers with multi-layered, self-discovered concepts. It builds on the work by Panousis et al. (2023), which introduces a way to produce a linear mapping from the space of similarity -- defined as the inner product between the image embedding and the concept embedding -- to the image class. Sparsity is induced with a binary matrix (Z), which also doubles as a representation of concept activation. The work of Panousis et al. (2023) is referred to as the 'high level concept discovery' in this current paper. This paper proposes to split an image into non-overlapping patches and repeat the same method to obtain 'low level concepts' for each patch. A max-pool is applied to predict the image class from the the patch level outputs. The paper then proposes a method to obtain a map between the low level and high level concepts. The joint-model is trained using stochastic gradient variational bayes and the results are compared with other state of the art methods.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and presents an interesting way to discover concepts at multiple levels and link them together. I appreciate that the paper tries to give readers an intuitive overview of the idea presented. Important equations are presented clearly at the right moment to explain the implementation.

### Weaknesses
It may be possible to perform out-of-sample evaluation of the model, which the authors did not attempt.

### Questions
Suggestions:
1. Please use less italics. There are many words in italics that need not be emphasized and end up being distracting.
2. It may be more standard to use the Hadamard product operator instead of the interpunct to denote element-wise product of matrices.
3. Page 3, Line 1: Shouldn't X_n be a three-dimensional tensor, not 4D? Also, define 'c'. I think it should be the number of channels.
4. Page 3, equation 1: please define 'A'.
5. Page 3, paragraph 7 ("In this work, ...): You overloaded the use of H and L to mean denote High/Low and the cardinality of concept sets. I am just being picky here.
5. Page 3, equation 3: please define A_H
6. Please report the values of the hyperparameters, epsilon and beta, in the main paper. I also spotted that alpha is reported in the appendix but the variable does not appear in the main paper. Does it refer to epsilon?
7. Suppose you have trained on a given set of train data and obtained Z_H, Z_L, W_{Hc} and W_{Lc}. Then, given a set of test data, you can retrain Z_H and Z_L while freezing W_{Hc} and W_{Lc}. By doing so, it may be possible for you to perform train-test evaluation. Can you please affirm or rebut this suggestion? If you think that this is a good idea, can you report the train and test results for your experiments? I would be willing to boost the rating of this paper if this question is addressed.

Questions:
1. How would you decide what are the optimal values of epsilon and/or beta? How would you think about the tradeoff between accuracy and sparsity?
2. In your experiments, you used the classes as the 'high level concepts' and ground truth attributes as the 'low level concepts'. It is conceivable that there is a hierarchy in the ground truth attributes (e.g., leaves, wood --> trees). Is it possible to extend your method to learn this hidden hierarchy?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework for ante-hoc interpretability that leverages image-text models/vision-language models to map unstructured human-understandable concepts to the whole image as well as specific patches of the images. This is in contrast to existing methods which map only the whole image to the text concept through similarity metrics. Further, the paper also unfolds a paradigm in concept discovery for enabling multi-level concept selection. The idea of the work stems from the notion that current concept activations in CBM methods tend to activate generic low-level concepts (class attributes: whiskers, eyes, etc.) that represent a high-level concept (the class present in an image: elephant, cat, etc.) , even when some low-level concepts (eg: beak of birds, tusks in elephants, etc.) may not be present/visible in that particular image. This may lead to significant concept omission, thus motivating the hierarchical multi-level concept discovery approach proposed herein.

### Strengths
+ The paper clearly identifies the existing problems and drawbacks of CBM models as stated through points (i) to (iv) in section 1. 
+ A potential problem with current CBM models and inability to consider a flexible concept bottle-neck layer that is inherently hierarchical, is interesting and does open a new problem in concept-based interpretable methods.
+ The proposed metric for evaluating interpretation capacity is also to be encouraged for future works in this direction: it helps to address the importance and quality of concepts in the final prediction.
+ The work effectively utilizes a variational inference approach to estimate the presence of high-level and low-level concepts, the method seems convincing. 
+ The baselines considered for the experiments are well-thought through.
+ The paper is generally easy to follow and well-written.

### Weaknesses
* At a high level, I am not completely convinced by the claim of "hierarchical multi-level concept discovery", since the methodology by design is intended only for two levels of concepts, not any deeper. It'd have been better to say "two-level" or "coarse-to-fine concepts", instead of "hierarchical multi-level". 
* Sec 3.3 talks about how the high-level and low-level concepts are connected. It states that the presence of a high-level concept provides information on which low-level concepts may or may not exist. I would have expected to see the concepts organized the other way – the presence of a set of low-level concepts triggers a high-level concept, the way it would happen in a visual processing pathway. Why is this flipped? What are the implications of this flip? 
* Continuing with the above point, if the high-level concept is first inferred, can’t the low-level concepts be inferred in an independent manner without the network itself? Acc to Fig 1, there is an independent classification layer for high-level and low-level concepts anyway, and one could use just the high-level module to classify.
* The need for hierarchical concept selection could be strengthened by designing experiments in CPM setting with A_Hactivations and without (replace it with whole set) to see the performance of A_L since the proposed model relies on both activations. Such ablation studies and detailed analysis seems lacking. For another example, experiments on different size of concept-pool would also help in evaluating the overall performance of the method across a varied condition resulting in validating the findings better. As stated earlier, including more levels of concept would be needed to strengthen the idea presented as a “multi-level concept discovery” work.
* Technically speaking, the work seems to be a derivative of the cited paper “Sparse Linear Concept Discovery Models”; the architectural differences lie in the use of two-level of concepts: high and low, rather than a single set of concepts. Furthermore, important ideas have been drawn from the paper such as sparsity inducing Bayesian approach. 
* The idea of multi-level concepts can be introduced directly in a standard CBM too, such that high-level concept activations in the first would trigger the low-level concept activations (with end-to-end). Why will this not address the stated purpose? 
* It is not clear why Region-CLIP or other CLIP variants that deal with images at the level of patches/superpixels/regions were not considered for the second level of concepts.
* The literature survey does not seem complete; there are papers like “Probabilistic CBMs, ICML 2023” that have been missed. 


*Minor suggestions:*
* I would recommend using \citep for references used as part of a sentence vs \cite in another places. This helps the readability of the paper.
* In Eqns 1 and 3, A seems undefined. It appears that it should be \mathbb{A}. Please correct this.

### Questions
1. The paper, in its introduction, lists limitations of CBM models. It is not clear why "(iii) their interpretability is substantially impaired due to the sheer amount of considered concepts, and (iv) they are not suited for tasks that require greater granularity." are a problem for CBMs. How does having a large number of concepts actually affect CBMs? I found this argument to be rather weak.
2. A similar statement is also made in Sec 2: "With the number of concepts ranging from the 100s to the 1000s, this can severely undermine the sought-after interpretability." Why do a large number of concepts affect interpretability?
