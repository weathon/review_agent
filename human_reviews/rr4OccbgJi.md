# A Lennard-Jones Layer for Distribution Normalization

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
We introduce a Lennard-Jones layer (LJL) to equalize the density across the distribution of 2D and 3D point clouds by systematically rearranging points without destroying their overall structure (distribution normalization). LJL simulates a dissipative process of repulsive and weakly attractive interactions between individual points by solely considering the nearest neighbor of each point at a given moment in time. This pushes the particles into a potential valley, reaching a well-defined stable configuration that approximates an equidistant sampling after the stabilization process. We apply LJLs to redistribute randomly generated point clouds into a randomized uniform distribution. Moreover, LJLs are embedded in point cloud generative network architectures by adding them at later stages of the inference process. The improvements coming with LJLs for generating 3D point clouds are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we apply LJLs to improve the point distribution of a score-based 3D point cloud denoising network. In general, we demonstrate that LJLs are effective for distribution normalization which can be applied at negligible cost without retraining the given neural networks.

### Summary
Learning-based 3D shape generation approaches, including auto-encoder, tend to generate 3D shapes with defects, i.e., shapes with holes and/or clusters, which is caused by inequal density distribution of points across the shape surface. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposed a Lennard-Jones layer (LJL) to equalize the density across the distribution of 2D and 3D point clouds while still keeping the overall shape structure. This process is termed as $\textit{distribution normalization}$.  Be more specific, Lennard-Jones potential is first computed for each pair of nearest points within a point cloud and each point is either pulled or pushed by the gradient of the potential as forces. 

In addition to a toy example on 2D Euclidean plane, the proposed LJL is evaluated on auto-encoder-based generative model and DDPM-based generative model. The $\textit{Distance Score}$ proposed in this paper is used to evaluate the point distribution increase by a large margin when integrating LJL into the above two generative models, while the generation results are slightly affected。

### Strengths
1. $\textbf{Problem Formulation}$: This paper indeed identifies an issue with the existing learning-based point cloud generation models, i.e., the generated 3D shapes contain holes and/or clusters, which is undesirable. 

2. $\textbf{Method soundness}$: In general, the adaptation of Lennard-Jones potential from chemistry and biology fields to redistribute 3D points is reasonable, as the formulation of LJ potential (Eq. 1) can push away points clustered together and pull points to fill up a hole.

3. $\textbf{Experimental Results}$: Both quantitative and qualitative results can validate the effectiveness of the proposed LJ layer in redistributing point distributions in generated point clouds.

### Weaknesses
1. $\textbf{Motivation}$

1.1 One concern is to what extend we need to redistribute points in generated point clouds? Holes and clusters indeed exist in the generated point clouds, but does this problem is severe enough? Some down-streaming or related tasks or applications which are severe affected by the inequal distribution of points are needed to strength the motivation of the paper.

1.2 If we generate more points for shapes and then uniformly downsample again, will the issue of holes and clusters be alleviated? This is related with the significance of the paper.

2. $\textbf{Method}$

2.1 According to Figure 3, it seems that the hyperparameters $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ have significant influence on the redistribution result, so it may need case-by-case tuning of $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ to achieve a good performance. Correct me if I'm wrong.

2.2 From Figure 5 and Figure 7, incorporating LJL could lead to over-smooth shape boundaries (wings and tailplanes in Figure 5) and slightly distortion of shape details (nose in Figure 7). This may be the drawback of the proposed approach. If such a drawback could be corrected, it will strengthen the paper.

3. $\textbf{Experiments}$

3.1 Some experimental details are missing. For example, how many points are generated per shape in experiments in Section 4.2? Did you retrain ShapeGF, and Lou & Hu's model or used their released pretrained model? Why not use the original evaluation metrics adopted in ShapeGF, and Lou & Hu's paper?

3.2 It is only evaluated on three generative approaches from two categories, e.g., audo-encoding and DDPM, more experiments and evaluations are needed.

4. $\textbf{Writting}$

4.1 The legend text in Figure 18 is too small to be seen clearly.

3.3 It is preferable to add citations in Table 1 and Table 2 to make it easier to check the reference papers.

### Summary
This paper presents the Lennard-Jones layer, a plug-and-play layer to normalize point cloud distributions which can be added to ShapeGF and DDPM for point cloud generation.  The paper provides some analyses of the priorities of the layer and evaluates the proposed method on some toy examples then point cloud generation problem on ShapeNet.

### Strengths
- The proposed method inspired by Lennard-Jones potential is new for the distribution normalization of 3D point clouds. The solution looks reasonable and might be useful for future research in this area. 

-  The paper is well-organized. It is nice to see the method is first evaluated using some toy examples and then extended to more complex cases.

### Weaknesses
Although some results presented in the paper look good, my main concern is that the paper fails to convincingly show the value or potential of the proposed method. 

- The authors choose to use the 3D point cloud generation tasks to show the value of the proposed layer. However, I think it is still questionable whether the method can be generalized to other or more advanced point cloud generation methods beyond ShapeGF and DDPM. If the method is only compatible with these two relatively old methods, the contribution of this method might not be high.

- The irregular distributions of point clouds may carry useful information about the point clouds. Normalizing point cloud distributions may not always be helpful to improve generation results. To balance the irregular structures and normalized distributions, it may need prior knowledge to adjust the hyper-parameters of the proposed method. According to Figure 14, the method seems sensitive to these hyper-parameters. Do you have a systematic/automatic solution to determine these parameters? If it is difficult to determine these parameters or the parameters need to be determined case-by-case, the method may not be able to generalize to various problems. 

- Table 1 and 2 only report the relative improvement. Can you provide detailed results? If the proposed method can directly improve the number reported in the original papers, the results will be more convincing.

### Summary
This paper extends the concept of Lennard-Jones potential to describe the distribution of 2D and 3D point clouds, where points are regarded as particles with pairwise repulsive and weakly attractive interactions. Based on optimizing pair-wise Lennard-Jones potential, the whole point clouds could have better distribution. Applications in 3D point cloud generation and denoising tasks have proved the effectiveness that the proposed method is able to maintain uniform distribution of points.

### Strengths
1. The writing is well and the paper is easy to follow.
2. The idea is reasonable and solid due to the dependence on mechanism of real-world atoms and monocular, and the problem of distribution is pervasive in various situations, which might inspire other researchers in this domain.
3. The experiments show significant improvement in point distribution.

### Weaknesses
1.	Lack of clear guidance in choosing hyper parameters (eg. \alpha and \beta in Eq. 2). Although there’s discussion in Appendix, the authors still adopt grid search. Due to the diversity in various point clouds with different local/global density, it is better to provide a more clear guidance for choosing hyper parameters. 
2.	The benefits of uniform distribution on downstream perception tasks (eg classification, segmentation, detection) is not verified, which is important since the application of point clouds mainly lies in perception tasks. This is not trivial since sometimes ununiform sampling is more effective (eg. Edge sampling in [1]) 
3.	All of these experiments are based on object-level point cloud. However, scene-level point cloud is more important in real-world applications. Is the proposed method still performs well when it comes to scene-level point clouds?
4.	The efficiency of this algorithm when processing large scale point clouds (~1 million points, which is common in some real-world datasets) is not mentioned.

### Summary
The paper proposes incorporating Lennard-Jones potential into the problem of point cloud generation in order to obtain more uniformly distributed point clouds. Minimizing the LJ potential can be seen as moving the points so that close-by points are neither too far or too close to each other. This operation can be inserted into certain time steps of a point cloud diffusion model to prevent the final result from forming holes and clusters. The proposed method is benchmarked on 2D through spectral analysis, and 3D via a diffusion autoencoder experiment.

### Strengths
* The uniformity of generated point clouds is a problem that is under-studied. This paper might raise awareness of the problem and encourage future works.
* The connection drawn between uniformly distributed point clouds and blue noise is interesting.
* Being an algorithm that is extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, the effect of different hyperparameters are well ablated and visualized.

### Weaknesses
* The proposed method might only be useful for certain classes of point cloud generative models. The paper only demonstrates improved point cloud uniformity when used in conjunction with ShapeGF (Cai et al.) and DDPM (Luo et al.). However, these two models are inherently flawed -- they formulate point cloud generation as independent points uniformly distributed on the surface, thus unable to capture the global uniformity. Methods that models joint distribution of points, such as LION (Zheng et al.) and Point-E (Nichol et al.) might already produce uniform point clouds without the proposed method.
* Evaluation is lacking -- it will be more solid if the proposed method can be benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using standard point cloud generation and reconstruction evaluation metrics on standard datasets, instead of just presenting the percentage increase over a simple baseline.
* The exposition is sometimes comfusing. For example, it is not clear how the optimal LJL parameters are found using Algorithm 2 -- it shows merely a diffusion autoencoder for point clouds.
* Minor writting issue: In Algorithm 2, "autoencoder" usually refers to an encoder-decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input. In this case, it is better to call "E_\theta" as "encoder" instead.

### Questions
* In the paper, it seems that a fixed set of hyperparameters is used for all the shapes. Will it cause problem for 3D shapes with vastly different surface areas? Would it be better to tune the sigma values differently for different shapes?
* Could you elaborate on the connection between blue noise and the quality of point clouds?
