## Abstract
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of latent variable models is often recast as an optimization problem over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions. For example, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm can be interpreted as coordinate descent applied to a suitable free energy functional over this space. Recently, this perspective has been combined with insights from optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows to develop particle-based algorithms applicable to wider classes of models than standard EM.
Drawing inspiration from prior works which interpret `momentum-enriched' optimisation algorithms as discretizations of ordinary differential equations, we propose an analogous dynamical systems-inspired approach to minimizing the free energy functional over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions. The result is a dynamic system that blends elements of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method, the underdamped Langevin diffusion, and particle methods. 
Under suitable assumptions, we establish quantitative convergence of the proposed system to the unique minimiser of the functional in continuous time. We then propose a numerical discretization of this system which enables its application to parameter estimation in latent variable models. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges faster than existing methods and compares favourably with other (approximate) MLE algorithms.

### Summary
The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm applied to latent variable models has previously been seen as a gradient flow in the joint space of parameters and probability distributions. Previous research has also found that representing a probability distribution as particles simplifies the computation of gradients and the resulting gradient flow algorithm. These have been presented in the literature as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) or Particle Gradient Descent (PGD).

This work seeks to accelerate the gradient step in PGD by infusing it with Nesterov momentum which is a well known technique that can be applied to any gradient descent algorithm. The authors provide the following technical contribution in this work
1) mathematical justification for their momentum infused gradient flow in this joint space (of parameters and probability distributions).
2) a proof of convergence of their gradient flow algorithm.
3) a partial update discretization for faster convergence.

In addition the authors show results on two datasets. One trivial dataset which demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach by including an ablation study of the partial update. The second dataset is a more realistic problem of building a Variational Auto Encoder where the momentum method described here seems to work very effectively.

### Strengths
Gradient flow algorithms in the Wasserstein-2 distance infused metric spaces over probability measures have suddenly become very trendy and as such this paper would certainly be of significant interest to the audience of this conference. The authors have taken a current algorithm, PGD, in this area and demonstrated through their experiments that the provided enhancement is an improvement. They also demonstrate that the addition of momentum is done in a theoretically sound manner, i.e. it "reproduces the dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator".

The authors provide a slightly improved momentum method that makes partial updates and they provide a theoretical proof of convergence. The partial update definitely appears to be original and the results on the toy dataset show that this partial update does have an impact on faster convergence.

The results on the Variational Auto Encoder suggest that their method is at least as good if not better than the nearest competing method.

### Weaknesses
The idea of adding momentum to gradient updates is very well known and it doesn't require deep theoretical justification to come up
with Equations 2a - 2d which follow quite obviously from PGD and the definition of Nesterov accelerated momentum.

The authors do provide a partial update discretization of the gradient flow which is not very obvious and the toy example does justify the partial updates. However, a toy example is not sufficient to prove the value of this novelty in the paper. I would refer to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00065, "Gradient Descent on Neural Networks Typically Occurs at the Edge of Stability" which shows that conclusions that are made on toy examples are quite the opposite of those in real world problems.

Showing convergence is valuable, but most gradient flow algorithms have a natural recipe to provide convergence under strong convexity and/or smoothness assumptions. So, this is not really a novelty here. It does go to overall quality of the paper though.

If we were to simply add a momentum step to every paper with a gradient update algorithm and show some results where it performs better then we would have a deluge of papers! For example in the Coin EM paper there is a SVGD-like gradient step for updating the density represented by particles. Now, one could certainly add momentum to that, does that make it a novel contribution?

I would readily admit that if adding momentum to an existing algorithm gives an improvement then it is worth disseminating. In my opinion though such contributions don't reach the level of originality demanded by a conference publication.

Minor:

typo: Confernece on page 10 in the citation for Kuntz 2023

typo: on page 9 AGPD -> MPGD

I would suggest some rearrangement to ensure that the inequalities in 35 are included in the main text.

### Questions
How does the partial update discretization compare to a naive momentum step for the Variational Auto Encoder problem?

How does this algorithm compare to the performance of other current particle-based approaches such as SVGD-like approaches. For example, the authors have cited the Coin EM paper which was published very recently and which provides two such algorithms (on a host of interesting datasets)?

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm by extending the method that was the Underdamped Langevin dynamics (Mckean-Vlasov process) in the particle-based approach recently proposed for the EM algorithm in latent variable models to the Overdamped form. The author develops the theory and formulation from the perspective of gradient flow in extending the Underdamped Langevin dynamics (Mckean-Vlasov process).

### Strengths
In this paper, the authors successfully extended the conventional Overdamped to an Underdamped approach of the Mckean-Vlasov process for latent variable models. They base their discussion and formulation on the principles of Gradient flow. Importantly, they demonstrate performance enhancements when their method is applied to real data.

### Weaknesses
I have concerns about whether the discussion on discretization in this paper is sufficient. There are two main types of discretization involved: one for the expected values of the particles, and the other along the time direction. The paper only briefly mentions using Kuntz's method in Section 5. However, it’s important to note that while the proposed method is based on Underdamped dynamics, Kuntz’s approach is for Overdamped scenarios. In usual Langevin dynamics, not specifically Mckean-Vlasov processes, it’s well-known that not paying enough attention to time discretization in Underdamped cases can lead to unstable dynamics, which is a crucial issue for sampling. But this paper does not seem to discuss these potential problems.

Additionally, the paper does not provide enough information on how to choose parameters properly. In the field of Langevin dynamics, it’s recognized that using Underdamped dynamics can lead to faster results if the parameters, like the momentum parameter, are chosen correctly. However, there is no clear guidance in the paper on how to achieve this acceleration in the context of the Mckean-Vlasov process.

### Questions
How should we choose the momentum parameter? Additionally, due to variations in this choice, how much of a difference in performance can we expect with real data, as opposed to a toy model?

### Summary
The authors propose a particle-based optimization method for Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of latent variable models. This method is a momentum variant of the particle gradient descent (PGD) method, which represents the gradient flow over the product space of Euclidean space and the space of probability distributions equipped with Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, the authors present the particle dynamics, known as the McKean-Vlasov process, and the corresponding continuity equation of the proposed method. Furthermore, they conduct a convergence analysis under the conditions of Lipschitz smoothness and extended log-Sobolev inequality. Experimental results validate the advantages of this proposed method.

### Strengths
This is the first study of the particle-based momentum method for solving MLE of latent variable models. The authors extend the analysis of the PGD method by Kuntz et al. (2023) into the momentum setup.

### Weaknesses
1. The momentum method is usually used for acceleration. However, the theoretical advantage, such as an improved convergence rate over PGD, has not been discussed. Indeed, we cannot see the benefit of the convergence analysis (Proposition 4.1) compared to the PGD method.

2. In light of the theoretical work on sampling and particle-based optimization methods, the provided analysis seems somewhat weak. For instance, the existence and smoothness of the solution of SDE (2a)-(2d), and any guarantees of the discretization (in time and space), are not provided.

3. The important assumptions should be exposed in the main text, and their reasonability should be discussed. However, Assumptions 1 and 2 (Lipschitz smoothness and LSI) are hidden in the Appendix. It is better that the authors provide an example that satisfies all assumptions to convince the readers that the theory is not vacuous.

4. The authors missed the series of mean-field optimization works. For instance, see the following papers and references therein:
- [Mei, Montanari, and Nguyen (2018)] A mean-field view of the landscape of two-layer neural networks. 
- [Chizat and Bach (2018)] On the global convergence of gradient descent for over-parameterized Convex Analysis of the Mean Field Langevin Dynamics models using optimal transport.

Minor comments: 
- Page 4: notation $\ell$ is undefined.
- Equation (1) is missing.

### Questions
Is it possible to discuss the time and particle complexities to achieve a given optimization precision? Such an analysis is quite standard in the optimization/sampling literature.

### Summary
The paper considers the classical problem of MLE in latent variable models. It proposes an extension of a recent work of Kuntz et al (2023, AISTATS) that itself exploits Neal & Hinton's perspective that classical EM (and variational EM) perform coordinate descent on the energy functional $\mathcal{E}(q, \theta)$ to have flexible nonparametric $q$ with convergence guarantees to the MLE. The extension here proposes to incorporate momentum methods typically used in stochastic optimization and popular in deep learning withing Kuntz's et al framework. It also derives the corresponding dynamical system in continuous time corresponding to the algorithm to establish convergence guarantees as Kuntz et al.

### Strengths
- The framework of Kuntz et al 2023 is interesting and impactful, and extending it is a worthwile direction which this paper addresses 
- The paper is clear and fairly honest in its contribution, with a clear objective

### Weaknesses
- Motivation for this particular extension. While it is natural to consider "momentum enriched" optimization algorithms in this context, I am left wondering whether there is a **strong** motivation, precisely: are there problems where PGD actually **struggles**,  *and* the new MPGD (even if well-tuned) really resolves the situation ? This is not very clear from the current version of the paper. Yes, we "can" do this extension and it's natural, and it seems to perform better (focussing for now on the toy example, where metrics are more interpretable and relate directly to the MLE problem) than PGD, but the toy example only shows a (relatively minor) *improvement* over PGD which is already working well. Could you think of an example where the benefits of MPGD vs PGD really show, i.e., PGD is converging very slowly and MPGD "fixes" the problem ?  Again in other words, the authors claim "we derive a discretization of the flow that can achieve better performance than PGD ...", and this is supported by the experiments. It "can be better" indeed, but how relevant is that? It would be stronger to show cases where PGD doesn't do well and MPGD really does (as opposed to cases where they both do well and MPGD does a bit better). 
- This point is related to the above; in the toy experiment, there is not a significant (in the sense of practically, not statistically) difference between MPGD and PGD (Figs 1(a) and (b) ) except for the underdamped and overdamped regimes (which presumably are less desirable). Can you try with different parameters (e.g. variances of the hierarchical model) to see if there is a setting where MPGD really shows its strength ?

### Questions
- In the second paragraph of Sec 2.2, "Under suitable assumptions, one can then compute that ..." What does the $< >$ denote here (it was not defined before) ( I am guessing it is an inner product, but it should be clearly defined) - can you provide a derivation for this in the Appendix, even if standard ? What are the assumptions required for the vector field $v$  
- In the last paragraph before 2.3 starts, what does the symbol $\bigotimes$ denote ? 
- You enrich both components of the space with momentum variables but why ? Is one of the two not enough ? 
- Regarding convergence of the flow, can you compare (explicitly) your results to those of Kuntz et al ? It is not cited at all in Sec 4. It is also quite unclear how informative these rates are, as there is no explicit dependence on $M$. 

Note that I did not carefully check the correctness of Section 4 and the related proofs in the Appendix.
