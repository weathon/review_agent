# Binary Hyperbolic Embeddings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
As datasets continue to grow, vector-based search becomes more storage and compute intensive, requiring large-scale systems to support retrieval. Proposed solutions range from quantization techniques that balance speed and accuracy, to hashing methods that learn compact binary representations. This paper promotes the use of hyperbolic space for its compact nature whilst overcoming its slow retrieval via binarization. Specifically, we address hyperbolic space's inherent slowness by proving that its complex similarity calculations can be equated to a binary XOR operation. Our approach allows for 90% less storage and at least 4.7 times faster search while maintaining performance of full-precision Euclidean embeddings.

### Summary
This paper proposes a hyperbolic space as a vector-based information retrieval. To keep the benefit of hyperbolic space while making the retrieval fast and reliable, the paper shows that hyperbolic distance computation can be replaced with the Hamming distance computation with proper binary encoding. Through the experiments with three datasets, the proposed method achieves less storage with a faster search while having competitive performance against Euclidean embeddings.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is well justified through the theoretical analysis. The experimental results support the theory.
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- In experiments, it is written that prototypes and embeddings are learned with different curvatures. Different curvature means different hyperbolic space. Measuring the distance between two points in different spaces doesn’t make sense to me. Although I understand that having prototypes not located near the boundary would benefit the overall performance empirically, this approach cannot be justified in theory.
- I suspect that the paper is written in a hurry. Here are some editorial comments about the manuscript.
    - There are some capitalization errors here and there (e.g., euclidean, poincare)
    - Use proper latex command for citations (\citet and \citep).
    - Use the vector image for better quality (Figure 1)
    - Typo in equation (11) and above. I guess the argument for function f is v, not x.
    - It would be good to provide additional background on metric equivalence for a wider audience.

### Questions
- Is adaptive quantization not considered in this work? since the data points are likely to be located near boundaries, appropriate adaptive quantization may improve the performance.
- How many bits are needed to achieve the same performance as the full precision method (Table 2)?
- Is the comparison with the other methods fair? It is noted that C++ implementation is used for the proposed method. What about the other methods? Are they also implemented in C++? if not, can we say this is a fair comparison?
- How are the hyperbolic embeddings obtained? For example, how does the embedding of CIFAR-100 is obtained from ResNet? Are the Euclidean embeddings transformed via exponential mapping?

### Summary
- The authors prove the approximate equivalence between hyperbolic distance and Hamming distance, allowing fast binary operations for similarity search with hyperbolic embeddings.

- The authors propose a method to binarize vectors in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space by quantizing each dimension and converting it to binary codes.

- The authors show experimentally that binary hyperbolic embeddings can achieve 4.7x speedup compared to full-precision Euclidean embeddings, while maintaining better retrieval performance.

- Across image and video datasets, the authors demonstrate that hyperbolic embeddings are much more robust to aggressive quantization/binarization compared to Euclidean embeddings.

### Strengths
The key contribution is enabling fast and compact binary codes for similarity search using hyperbolic embeddings, through an approximate equivalence to Hamming distance. This makes hyperbolic embeddings viable for large-scale retrieval applications.

### Weaknesses
- The proof of equivalence between hyperbolic and Hamming distance is approximate, and its accuracy depends on the linear approximation parameters. More analysis could be provided on the tightness of this approximation.

- The quantization and binarization scheme is simple and applied in a dimension-wise manner. More sophisticated methods like product quantization could potentially improve accuracy.

- Only the Poincaré ball model is evaluated. Extending the binary encoding ideas to other hyperbolic models like Lorentz could increase generality.

- The image and video datasets used are standard but small-scale.

- The ResNet and 3D ResNet backbones used are a bit dated.

- There is no comparison to other binary encoding methods like binary autoencoders or binary hashing.

- The speedup measurements use a C++ implementation. For fairer comparison, all methods should be benchmarked in the same codebase/hardware.

- The impact of factors like codebook design and learning hyperparameters could be investigated more thoroughly via ablation studies

### Questions
- The linear approximation of the hyperbolic distance has two parameters, K1 and K2. Could you provide some analysis on the tightness of this approximation and how it impacts the equivalence with Hamming distance?

### Summary
This paper investigates the topic of hyperbolic embeddings. 
The authors introduce a novel technique for producing binary hyperbolic embeddings, aiming to reduce the storage and computational costs of conventional hyperbolic embeddings. 
They show that the hyperbolic distance computation can be approximately equivalent to the scaled binary Hamming distance computation. 
Through several experiments, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in comparison to other embedding methods.

### Strengths
S1. **Innovative Approach:** 
The idea of combining binary representations with hyperbolic geometry for embeddings presents a new avenue in the research area.

S2. **Efficiency:** 
Binary embeddings can be more space-efficient and faster to compute, which is crucial for large-scale applications where memory and computational resources are limited.

S3. **Theoretical Insights:** 
This work does not solely rely on empirical findings; it incorporates theoretical insights to provide foundational support for the proposed binary embedding.

### Weaknesses
W1. **Unclear How to Incorporate Hierarchical Knowledge:**
The experiments (e.g., Table 3) demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating hierarchical knowledge, suggesting that the proposed embeddings can effectively leverage such information. However, the lack of a detailed explanation or illustration of how hierarchical knowledge is integrated into the embedding process could hinder the reproducibility and understanding of the method.

W2. **Clarity In Proposition 2:**
In reviewing the proof of Proposition 2, I was confused about the formula of the hamming distance, i.e., 
$d_{\mathbb{H}}(\boldsymbol{x}^b, \boldsymbol{y}^b) = nd - {\Vert \boldsymbol{x}^b \oplus \boldsymbol{y}^b \Vert}_0$. 

Based on my understanding, it should be $d_{\mathbb{H}}(\boldsymbol{x}^b, \boldsymbol{y}^b) = {\Vert \boldsymbol{x}^b \oplus \boldsymbol{y}^b \Vert}_1$. Could you provide an illustration of this formula?

Moreover, I have identified a potential gap in the logical progression from Equation (8) to Equation (9). The transition between these equations is a critical step in the proof, and it appears that additional clarification or intermediate steps are needed to fully substantiate the authors' claims.

W3. **Generalizability Concerns**
I noticed that in Sections 4.3 to 4.5, the experimental results are presented using a single dataset. While the results are promising, they do not fully demonstrate the robustness and general applicability of the proposed method across diverse data scenarios.
It would be highly beneficial if the authors could expand their experimental evaluation to include all three datasets mentioned in the supplementary material. This would not only reinforce the validity of the claims made but also demonstrate the method's performance across different types of data and tasks.

### Questions
Regarding W1:

Q1: It would be beneficial if the authors could include a step-by-step illustration or a more detailed algorithmic description that explicitly shows how hierarchical information is processed and incorporated into the embeddings. Or, if there are any pre-processing steps or specific transformation techniques used to encode hierarchical knowledge into the binary embeddings, these should be clearly described.

Regrading W3:

Q2: Could the authors extend their experimental evaluation to include additional datasets as presented in the supplementary material?

In addition, I also found some typos when reviewing the paper. I enumerate some of them below:

In Page 4, Equation (7) should be $\approx {\Vert \boldsymbol{U} \boldsymbol{x}^b \Vert}^2 + {\Vert \boldsymbol{U} \boldsymbol{y}^b \Vert}^2 - 2{\langle \boldsymbol{U} \boldsymbol{x}^b, \boldsymbol{U} \boldsymbol{y}^b \rangle}$.

In Page 7, Table 2: Bits $n \times d \rightarrow$ Bits $d \times n$.

In Page 8, Table 3: The authors' names of the methods are duplicated.
