- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
The social graphs synthesized by the generative models are increasingly in demand due to data scarcity and concerns over user privacy. One of the key performance criteria for generating social networks is the fidelity to specified conditionals, such as users with certain membership and financial status. While recent diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generating images, their effectiveness in synthesizing graphs has not yet been explored in the context of conditional social graphs. In this paper, we propose the first kind of conditional diffusion model for social networks, CDGraph, which trains and synthesizes graphs based on two specified conditions. We propose the co-evolution dependency in the denoising process of CDGraph to capture the mutual dependencies between the dual conditions and further incorporate social homophily and social contagion to preserve the connectivity between nodes while satisfying the specified conditions. Moreover, we introduce a novel classifier loss, which guides the training of the diffusion process through the mutual dependency of dual conditions. We evaluate CDGraph against four existing graph generative methods, i.e., SPECTRE, GSM, EDGE, and DiGress, on four datasets. Our results show that the generated graphs from CDGraph achieve much higher dual-conditional validity and lower discrepancy in various social network metrics than the baselines, thus demonstrating its proficiency in generating dual-conditional social graphs.

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Summary
This paper proposes a dual conditional diffusion model for social graph synthesizing. The proposed model can capture the dependency between two specified conditions, social homophily and social contagion. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

### Strengths
1. A new diffusion model for social graph synthesizing, which is under-exploration.  
2. The proposed model can capture the dependency between social homophily and social contagion, which is important to social graphs.  
3. The completeness of the work is satisfactory, including the design of the loss and classifier.

### Weaknesses
1. The author's real motivation is confusing. Why the dual conditional model is important and why not more (than two) should be clearly pointed out before explaining the challenges (maybe not just giving examples).  
2. The reason why the authors choose social homophily and social contagion as the two specific conditions in this paper is not clear. The author's criteria or basis for selecting these two aspects should be introduced. No explanation of the above two concepts is not provided when they first appear.  
3. Both social homophily and social contagion are based on the assumption of network homogeneity. However, more and more works point out the heterogeneity of real-world networks, especially in social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Therefore, it is concerning whether the assumptions on which the method is based are good for social graphs.  
4. The scalability of the proposed method is slightly unsatisfactory. As a dual conditional method, the proposed method uses the conditions between the nodes/edges to implement two specific conditional constraints through the transfer of point and edge information. It is not explored whether the model can be applied to any two constraints and how it should be extended if both conditions are at the node level (independent of edges).  
5. Figure 2 should be improved for more clarity with some explanations either in the figure or in the caption.  
6. The ablation studies of each condition and loss are missing.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new model, CDGraph, for generating social networks based on specified conditions. The model incorporates social homophily and contagion to maintain connectivity between nodes while satisfying the conditions. It also introduces a novel classifier loss to guide the training process. CDGraph outperforms four existing methods in terms of dual-conditional validity and social network metrics.

### Strengths
1. The authors of this paper have developed a novel dual-conditional graph diffusion model called CDGraph for synthesizing social graphs. 
2. They have introduced a co-evolution dependency feature that incorporates social homophily and social contagion, allowing for the preservation of structural information between nodes that satisfy specified conditions.
3. Additionally, they have proposed a unique loss function for the dual-condition classifier, which guides the denoising process of CDGraph to optimize both the discrepancy in the diffusion process and the fulfillment of conditions. Through evaluations on four real-world social networks, the authors have demonstrated that CDGraph outperforms existing methods in generating social graphs that meet the specified dual conditions while maintaining important social network properties.

### Weaknesses
1.	Contributions only focus on the design of the model, and its motivation is insufficient, and the motivation for designing the model is not clearly explained to the reader.
2.	Some of the figures in the paper are difficult to read, due to the fact that too many models are included in the same figure.
4.	In the experimental part, the author focuses on the lack of sufficient comparison algorithms on the performance of different data sets in the designed method, which is not convincing enough. In particular, the comparison algorithm lacks the classical algorithm.
3.	The author proposed three algorithms, which are CDGraph Training for e pseudocode of the sampling of the diffusion process, CDGraph Training for sampling procedure and Conditional Sampling for pseudocode of the sampling of the diffusion process. But no ablation test was offered. How do these algorithms perform and how are they represented?
4.	The table headers of some graphs are confusing, and the reviewer suggests changing the table headers or table lines appropriately.

### Questions
1. How does the conditional diffusion model ensure that the model learns the Specified conditions? Please explain in detail.
2. Methods such as DDPM are specifically mentioned in related work, but they are not compared in related experiments. If there is any relevant work, please add or if there is no or the result is not satisfactory, please explain the reason.

### Summary
In response to the growing demand for social graphs in light of data scarcity and privacy concerns,  this paper introduces CDGraph, a novel conditional diffusion model for social networks. CDGraph effectively synthesizes social graphs while adhering to specified conditions.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is the first attempt to develop a conditional diffusion model for social networks.
(2) The process of CDGraph is introduced in detail.

### Weaknesses
(1)  The authors propose social homophily-based co-evolution and social contagion-based co-evolution. However, how CDGraph captures the interdependencies between these specified conditions does not seem to be clearly explained.
(2)  Figure 3 lacks relevant figure captions, making it slightly difficult to read.
(3)  The reasons for some experimental results are not explained in depth. For example, there is a lack of detailed reasons why Relative error ratios of #nodes on the BlogCatalog data set, and Clust. coeff reaches suboptimality. 
(4)  The authors fail to describe its limitations and broader impacts.

### Questions
It seems that the comparison algorithms only consider one condition. Only the proposed CDGraph considers two conditions, and the evaluation indicator "Validity" evaluates the proportion of nodes that meet the two specified conditions? Is this evaluation indicator unreasonable enough? （in addition to the restructured DiGress）

### Summary
The proliferation of social networks has led to the demand for synthetic social graphs that mimic real ones, allowing for the analysis of specific user profiles and network structures. Existing methods, such as statistical sampling and deep generative models, have limitations in capturing dependencies across dual conditions and accounting for social homophily and social contagion phenomena in conditional social graphs. This paper introduces a novel conditional graph generative model *CDGraph*, exploiting co-evolution dependency to guide the diffusion process to capture the dependencies between the node and edge conditions, solving the problem of the limitation of social homophily and social contagion. Furthermore, the authors propose a dual conditional classifier to guide the sampling process to fulfill dual conditions while capturing the correlation between the specified conditions. The paper conducts extensive experiments on real-world networks and evaluates the performance on validity and error discrepancies of the generated graphs compared to the input graphs. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different correlations among specified conditions.

### Strengths
- This paper astutely highlights the presence of interdependencies among correlated conditions in conditional social graphs and provides insights into the evolution of social graphs concerning social homophily and social contagion. 

- This paper proposes a novel notion of co-evolution dependency to be implemented on the conditional diffusion process of *CDGraph*, which naturally integrates the structure of diffusion denoising models and the social homophily-based and social contagion-based co-evolution of nodes and edges in social graphs.

- A formally derived dual conditional classifier is proposed to guide the sampling process to fulfill dual conditions while capturing the correlation between the specified conditions, which strengthens the validity of the generated graphs.

- The evaluation in the paper focuses on assessing the validity and error discrepancies of the generated graphs in comparison to the input graphs. The terms of evaluation are thoroughly covered.

### Weaknesses
- I think the reason why a dual conditional social graph can be stated more clearly in the paper. The scarcity of data is not a sufficient reason to justify the need for a dual conditional social graph. Is the **dual conditional** social graph applicable to any representative downstream scenarios?

- The crucial phenomena of social homophily and social contagion of social graphs are stated in the paper. However, I am wondering if the error ratios and the MMD metrics are sufficient to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in capturing the social homophily and social contagion is not included in the paper, and I think more metrics and experiment forms may be added, as the nature of network co-evolution is the primary motivation of the proposed model. 

- The network parameterization (denoiser architecture) should be provided in the paper (could be in the appendix). Is there any specified design of the network structure in light of this problem?

- The effect of the classifier guidance is not sufficiently demonstrated in the experiments. An ablation study may be needed, by comparing the performance of the proposed model with and without the classifier.

- The details of the calculations of the metrics should be provided in the appendix.

### Questions
Most of my concerns are raised in the Weaknesses section. Further questions are listed below:

- The dimensions of the notations in Sec 3.1 are not clearly stated, nor the exact size of input of the diffusion process. What's more, there seems to be a mistake in mixing up the $E_c$ and $E$, and the definition of $E$ is not clear. What is the meaning of "E is a one-hot encoding vector representing whether **an edge** between v_n and v_m in GC **satisfies condition c**"?

- The formulation in equation 5 does not seem to contribute to the method's design. What is the motivation for introducing the formulation?  

- As the number of dimensions needs to be specified in the input of the diffusion reverse process, the number of nodes should be a human-specified parameter, which does not seem proper to be a metric for evaluating the performance.

- The proposed method does not seem to be applicable to graphs with more than 2 conditions. However, the profiles of users in a social graph often consist of multiple properties. Is there any future direction to extend the method to graphs with more than 2 conditions?

- The density metric of the CDGraph in the Twitter dataset is the worst among all the methods. Is there any explanation for this?
