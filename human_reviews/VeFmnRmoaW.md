## Abstract
Selecting urban regions for metro network expansion that serve maximal transportation demands is critical to urban development, while computationally challenging to solve. First, metro network expansion is dependent on multiple complicated features, such as urban demographics, origin-destination (OD) flow, and relationships with existing metro lines, requiring a unified model to incorporate these correlated features for region selection. Second, it is a complex decision-making task with an enormous solution space and various constraints, due to the large number of candidate regions and restrictions on urban geography. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework to solve a Markov decision process on an urban heterogeneous multi-graph, achieving metro network expansion by intelligently selecting a set of nodes on the graph. A novel graph neural network is proposed, which unifies the complicated features and learns effective representations for urban regions. In addition, we design an attentive reinforcement learning agent with action masks to efficiently search the large solution space and avoid infeasible solutions indicated by the various constraints. Experiments on real-world urban data of Beijing and Changsha show that our proposed approach can improve the satisfied transportation demands substantially by over 30\% compared with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. Further in-depth analysis demonstrates that MetroGNN can provide explainable results in scenarios with much more complicated initial conditions and expansion requirements, indicating its applicability in real-world metro network design tasks.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the problem of metro network expansion, which they formulate as an MDP. The action is selecting a region and adding it to the metro network, and the reward is the increment of satisfied OD flow. They utilize a RL framework to solve the MDP. They use a GNN network to inject spatial contiguity and OD flow into region representations. The action mask and attentive policy network are used to ensure the feasibility of the result and to reduce search space. Authors apply the method to real-world urban data and witness significant performance improvements.

### Strengths
S1. The notion of region is particularly interesting, as it overcomes the limitation of fixed-size grids and captures both spatial proximity and traffic flow patterns.
S2. The work addresses numerous traditional and RL-based methods as baselines, with detailed comparisons and experiments. This justifies the use of RL methods in the practical aspect. The case study of complicated scenarios also give convincing explanations.
S3. The ablation study is thorough, and strengthens the design choices of the algorithm framework.

### Weaknesses
W1. In the "Overall Framework" section, the MDP and RL framework do not have a formalized definition, and the description and implementation details of the overall RL framework is rather unclear.
W2. Some of the notations in the equations are not sufficiently clarified. For example, in equation (6), it is better to explicitly state that alpha_{i, j} is the relevance measure, and pinpoint the meaning of i and j.

### Questions
1. What is the precise definition of OD trips? How is it obtained from your dataset?
2. How do you determine whether a selected region should be an extension of an existing metro line (and which?) or the start of a new line? Is it determined in the agent's action, or by some other means?
3. In equation (5), which metro line do n_{+-1} and n_{+-2} refer to?

### Summary
This work addresses the metro network expansion problem, in which the goal is to decide which edges to add to a metro graph such as to optimize the total satisfied flow between origin-destination pairs in the network, subject to a budget constraint. The authors approach this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process and proposing a reinforcement learning method that uses graph neural networks for encoding state information. More specifically, the authors consider two types of features in the GNN design: spatial features and flows, which are concatenated. The authors compare the proposed method with a variety of classic optimization algorithms and a recent RL approach, showing gains in optimality over these methods.

### Strengths
Originality: the work applies a method based on RL and GNNs to a new problem.  This intersection, by now, has a growing body of literature and is a fairly common "recipe".  It is moderately original in the design of its approach. 

Quality: the quality of the paper is reasonable, but I have substantial concerns about the soundness of the evaluation as well as its lack of clarity in places.

Clarity: the organization of the paper is clear. The writing is of reasonable quality. The main issue in terms of clarity is the lack of precision in the description of the problem / solution method.

Significance: the work is of interest to the ICLR community, and belongs to the growing machine learning for combinatorial optimization literature.

### Weaknesses
**W1**. A major weakness is the fact that the authors do not report aggregated results across several runs together with statistical confidence measures (e.g. error bars). These should be presented for all figures and tables in order to account for the stochasticity of model training. Otherwise, a possible alternative explanation for the observed results is that one of the "lucky" seeds was used, which yields better performance than what we might see in the average case. It is not possible, in my opinion, to draw reliable conclusions from the presented results. In case multiple runs were indeed carried out, these details should be reported.

**W2**. Lack of (mathematical) precision in the description of the problem and solution method. The authors should aim for a level of clarity that would enable someone to reproduce the results starting from the descriptions only. This is currently not the case. Some examples where this is apparent:

- Most importantly, the MDP components (currently in Appendix A) should be formalised mathematically and not described only in plain English. 
- Equation 1: presumably $i \neq j$, given self-loops are not allowed?
- Equation 3: $\mathcal{N}$ was already used to denote the entire set of nodes, whereas in this equation it is used to denote the neighbourhood. They are not the same, unless the graph is fully connected.
- The set of input features to the GNN should be fully described in the Method section and not only when discussing the ablation results (4.4).
	
**W3**. Potential limited scalability: the authors consider networks with up to 60 nodes, whereas the real Beijing network has approximately ~500 nodes. Hence, the problem as considered is a simplification, and this should be acknowledged. I expect that the observed performance improvement does not come "for free", and that the method suffers in scalability and has substantially longer running times than the classic methods. Studying the scalability of the method (around what number of nodes does it fail to find satisfactory solutions compared to the baseline) and adding representative runtimes for the methods would improve the manuscript.

### Questions
**C1**. The writing contains some important inaccuracies that should be fixed:

- "To achieve efficient search of the NP-hard problem" -> the solution space, not the problem itself, is being searched
- "The proposed model [...] successfully reduces the large solution space"; "the attentive policy network reduces the solution space drastically": as far as I can tell, the model itself does not reduce the solution space; rather, it may indeed be more efficient in how this search space is navigated.
	
**C2**. Typos: consider running a spellcheck. Some I have spotted: generic -> genetic (p2), maksed -> masked (p4), donate -> denote (p5)

**C3**. The analysis in 4.5 is tenuous, especially given the lack of multiple runs. For example, if we were to stop the process at step 60, we could draw a different conclusion from the one presented in this paragraph. Does this finding repeat across 10+ runs? 

**C4**. The following recent paper considers metro network planning as a case study and also uses a reinforcement learning approach. In my opinion, while not directly comparable, it should be cited:

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to solve the metro network expansion task (a geometrical combinatorial optimization problem) for maximizing overall OD flow satisfaction with several constraints, e.g., total budget, spacing between stations, and line straightness. The proposed framework, MetroGNN, incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and an attentive policy network with an action mask to learn representations for urban regions and select new metro stations. The experiments conducted on real-world urban data of Beijing and Changsha demonstrate that the proposed MetroGNN can improve OD flow satisfaction by over 30% against the state-of-the-art RL-based approach.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes to solve a complex metro network expansion problem by using a graph-based reinforcement learning framework. The problem is significant, and the solution makes sense to me. 
2. The proposed approach is evaluated on two real-world urban datasets collected from two Chinese metropolises, Beijing and Changsha, which demonstrates its effectiveness in improving the overall OD flow satisfaction.
3. This paper is overall well-written and easy to follow. The illustrations are clear and helpful to understand this paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical contributions of this work are limited. While the metro network expansion task is essentially a transportation network combinatorial optimization problem, there have been many existing works [1] studying how to apply RL combined with GNN or attention to address it. It seems the authors only introduce some of the same or similar methods to a specific combinatorial optimization problem. However, there are no substantial technical innovations.
2. While this work investigates a realistic metro network expansion problem, it only aims to optimize the total satisfied OD flow. However, many other factors need to be considered and optimized to construct a realistic metro network, e.g., social equity or fairness, environmental impact, and revenues. It’s hard to evaluate whether the proposed method is applicable in real scenarios.
3. Some important experimental setups are not mentioned or clearly described. For example, the statistics and analysis of datasets. The implementation and hyper-parameter details of baselines. Such information is very significant for the evaluation of experimental reliability.

### Questions
1. The collected real OD flow data are based on the realistic transportation network. If the metro networks have be changed, how can the authors obtain the corresponding OD flow?

### Summary
Selecting urban regions for traffic route construction to maximize origin-destination flow is a hard optimization problem because the solution space grows exponentially on the number of nodes. This paper models this problem as a MDP and applies reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to search for a good solution.  This paper uses a graph neural network to learn the state representation and use action masks to rule out unavailable actions. The empirical results show this method increases the total origin-destination flow by 30% compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
1. This paper builds an end-to-end reinforcement learning algorithm to find a good solution in a combinatorial optimization problem - traffic routes construction. To learn this solution efficiently, this paper builds a graph neural network to learn the state representation.

2. Its empirical results show this method increases the total origin-destination flow by 30% compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### Weaknesses
1. My major concern is that this paper does not have enough novelty to be published in a top machine learning venue. Indeed, selecting urban regions for traffic route construction to maximize origin-destination flow is a hard optimization problem because the solution space grows exponentially on the number of nodes. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has been known to be a useful tool for searching solutions in a large solution space since 1996 [1].

2. Moreover, using graph neural networks to learn state representation is also not a novel technique. The network proposed in this paper is not well-justified to have sufficient novelty.

3. Using action masks to eliminate infeasible regions is also a common approach in RL applications.

4. Other than insufficient novelty in the algorithm, the model built by this paper is also preliminary. For example, it is natural to consider that more regions could emerge as the city is expanding. The model in this paper is obviously not a high-fidelity model that could be used in real construction.

5. This paper is not well-written. The details of the model and algorithms are not defined in a clear and mathematical way. The presentation and coherence of this paper could be greatly improved by deleting excessive words and sentences.
