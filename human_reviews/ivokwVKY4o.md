- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)

## Abstract
Bound propagation with branch-and-bound (BaB) is so far among the most effective methods for neural network (NN) verification. However, existing works with BaB have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a framework for conducting BaB based on bound propagation with general branching points and an arbitrary number of branches, as an important move for extending NN verification to models with various nonlinearities beyond ReLU. Our framework strengthens verification for common element-wise activation functions, as well as other multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplication. In addition, we find that existing heuristics for choosing neurons to branch for ReLU networks are insufficient for general nonlinearities, and we design a new heuristic named BBPS, which usually outperforms the heuristic obtained by directly extending the existing ones originally developed for ReLU networks. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our BaB framework on verifying a wide range of NNs, including networks with Sigmoid, Tanh,  sine or GeLU activations, LSTMs and ViTs, which have various nonlinearities. Our framework also enables applications with models beyond neural networks, such as models for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF).

### Summary
This work extends the linear-bound-propagation and BaB based neural network verification framework $\alpha\beta$-CROWN to support branching on any node of the computational graph and thus on inputs to arbitrary non-linearities. Technically, these additional constraints are enforced using Lagrange multipliers. Additionally, a novel branching heuristic, BBPS, is introduced that leverages precomputed linear bounds as "shortcuts" to compute better approximations of the branching effect. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on a wide variety of activation functions.

### Strengths
* The tackled issue of (certified) adversarial robustness is of high importance.
* To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to describe the application of the popular BaB paradigm to general non-linearities.
* The paper combines well established techniques (general cutting planes and optimisable relaxation slopes) to enable branching for general non-linearities.
* The novel branching heuristic is elegant and effective (for non-ReLU activations).
* The extensive empirical evaluation is convincing and clearly shows improved performance over a wide range of baselines.

### Weaknesses
* Prior work and novel contributions are not always distinguished clearly, i.e., it is not immediately clear that Section 3.1 describes the prior work $\alpha\beta$-CROWN. Similarly, it is not clear that the general branching constraints described in Section 3.3 constitute special cases of the General Cutting Planes described by Zhang et al. (2022).
* The technical contribution beyond BBPS, seem limited as both enforcing arbitrary constraints on intermediate activations (Zhang et al. 2022) and optimising relaxation parametrisation was already possible in the  $\alpha\beta$-CROWN version this work builds on.

### Questions
### Questions
1) Can you give an intuition on why BBPS does not seem to yield any improvement on ReLU networks while being crucial for other non-linearities?
2) At the bottom of page 5, you state that branching a neuron in node i only affects the linear relaxations of nonlinear nodes immediately after node i. Can tighter bounds there not lead to tighter bounds in later nodes and thus changing relaxations?
3) What is the impact of the branching factor $K$ on the resulting precision? Can you ablate its effect on one of the CIFAR10 networks, where branching was particularly effective? Can the same neuron be split multiple times in your framework?

### Conclusion 
The authors successfully establish the effectiveness of BaB for general non-linearities and the advantages of their novel branching heuristic on a wide range of benchmarks and compared to a diverse set of baselines. While the technical novelty seems limited, I believe that demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of established techniques in this setting is a valuable contribution in itself and am thus leaning to accept the paper. However, I believe the authors should make sure that novel contributions (Section 3.2 and 3.4) are clearly distinguished from prior work (Section 3.1 and 3.3), and have thus reduced my score. I am happy to raise it once this concern is addressed.

### Summary
The paper presents a generalisation of a very popular network verifier, $\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN, to new nonlinearities. In particular, branching support for sigmod, tanh, sine, GeLU and multiplication is added, along with bounding support (in terms of optimizable linear bounds) for the last three. Results show that the proposed techniques are more effective than relevant baselines on the considered settings.

### Strengths
The work extends the support of a state-of-the-art network verifier to nonlinearities beyond piece-wise linear. 
As one would expect, the resulting framework remains effective on the considered non-linearities. In particular, the authors show that the presented framework works reasonably well on LSTM (on vision data) and ViTs.

### Weaknesses
While the work is definitely of interest to the practitioners in the area, the vast majority of the presented material is a fairly straightforward extension of very well known concepts in the literature. It would not appear to me that the extensions presented great technical challenges that needed to be overcome. Indeed, while branch-and-bound is mostly employed on piece-wise nonlinearities in the context of neural network verification, it is a fairly general concept which the authors simply instantiated on more variants of the neural network verification problem.

More in detail, the support of more nonlinearities in the bounding phase is a trivial applications of concepts presented in (Zhang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020). And, in practice, the $\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN already extended the concept of optimizable linear bound propagation beyond ReLU (through support for sigmoid and tanh). As a result, extending these ideas to more nonlinearities is quite incremental. Similarly, previous work has already extended activation splitting to non-ReLU activations (Henriksen and Lomuscio, 2020). I believe this incrementality should be acknowledged more in the motivational sections of the paper.
While the branching part could have more room for improvement, the authors focus on extending a relatively old branching heuristic (BaBSR) that is typically preferred by more effective strategies in state-of-the-art works (FSB in $\beta$-CROWN, and the custom strategy introduced in MN-BaB). Furthermore, the authors do not justify the use of ternary branching (k=3) with uniform spacing between the branching points.

The experimental results are also on mostly toy problems and with fairly small perturbation sizes (1/255 as opposed to 2/255 and 8/255 typically employed in the literature on CIFAR-10). The authors sometimes select the properties to verify by excluding the properties that would be verified by CROWN (for instance, table 3). Taking the above into account, I am not sure how significant some of the improvements with respect to pre-existing work are (for instance, $\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN without branching on Figure 2 and table 3).

In conclusion, I believe that most of the merit of the work pertains to the implementation. I am not sure this meets the bar for an ICLR publication.

### Questions
- Could the authors justify their choice for ternary (and uniform) branching? For instance, an ablation study on the number of branching points would be useful.

- I found the explanation of the branching strategy to be quite confusing. For instance, the presentation of BaBSR heavily differs from the one from the original authors, which is based on computing coefficients that estimate the impact of splitting on the last layer bounds from the (Wong and Kolter 2018) paper. Could the authors explain why the two presentations are equivalent?

### Summary
The paper extends the α,β-Crown verification framework to support the
verification of neural networks with general activation functions. In
particular it introduces a novel branching mechanism that allows for splitting
a neuron in more than two branches. It additionally presents a variant of the
BaBSR branching heuristic for selecting the neuron to split at each step. The
experimental results reported show improvements over the state-of-the-art
verifiers on some common and on some more complex benchmarks.

### Strengths
Novel extension of the α,β-Crown framework to tackle general activation
functions. Good experimental evaluation showing the efficacy of the resulting
method.

### Weaknesses
- Highly incremental to α,β-Crown - the resulting method is essentially
  α,β-Crown with support for more than two branches per split.

- The BBPS branching heuristic a trivial variant of BaBSR, it gives marginal
  gains, and it is not compared with other preciser variants of BaBSR from  De
  Palma et al., 2021.

### Summary
The paper introduces a verification framework with BaB for neural networks that 1) encompasses general branching points and an arbitrary number of branches, which could generalize NN verification to variety of networks with various activation functions; 2) develops a novel branching heuristic named BBPS with a more accurate estimation; 3) enables verification on models for the ACOPF application.

### Strengths
1. BBPS constantly outperforming existing SOTA neural network verification on several benchmark datasets.
2. The author conducts experiments on different network architectures, it's interesting to see the study about effectiveness of neural network verification on modern architectures like ViT.
3. The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. It seems that all the classifiers are trained on PGD, it would be better if authors could report a more comprehensive evaluation on other robust training algorithms.
2. It would be better if the author could provide a comparison including quantitative results of average running time for clarity.
