# Mining Patents with Large Language Models Demonstrates Congruence of Functional Labels and Chemical Structures

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
Predicting chemical function from structure is a major goal of the chemical sciences, from the discovery and repurposing of novel drugs to the creation of new materials. Recently, new machine learning algorithms are opening up the possibility of general predictive models spanning many different chemical functions. Here, we consider the challenge of applying large language models to chemical patents in order to consolidate and leverage the information about chemical functionality captured by these resources. Chemical patents contain vast knowledge on chemical function, but their usefulness as a dataset has historically been neglected due to the impracticality of extracting high-quality functional labels. Using a scalable ChatGPT-assisted patent summarization and word-embedding label cleaning pipeline, we derive a Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100K molecules and their patent-derived functional labels. The functional labels were validated to be of high quality, allowing us to detect a strong relationship between functional label and chemical structural spaces. Further, we find that the co-occurrence graph of the functional labels contains a robust semantic structure, which allowed us in turn to examine functional relatedness among the compounds. We then trained a model on the CheF dataset, allowing us to assign new functional labels to compounds. Using this model, we were able to retrodict approved Hepatitis C antivirals, uncover an antiviral mechanism undisclosed in the patent, and identify plausible serotonin-related drugs. The CheF dataset and associated model offers a promising new approach to predict chemical functionality.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper uses ChatGPT as a strong assistant to summarize chemical patent information to provide more functional labels for related molecules. This paper proposes a pipeline containing both the label creation step and the label cleaning step.

### Strengths
(1) This reviewer believes the generated large-scale datasets can be a solid contribution to the ai4science community and the label creation process can be transferred to other similar scientific dataset collections;

(2) The label creation and label cleaning process is clearly shown through figure illustrations and paragraph descriptions, which is easy for readers to follow.

### Weaknesses
(1) It seems this paper only designs a dataset collection pipeline and no benchmark works are involved. For example, a complete benchmark work should include additional evaluations of some baseline methods. This reviewer thinks only the dataset construction contribution is not sufficient for publishing in ICLR;

(2) Although the problem formulation seems very straightforward (functional label prediction), it still lacks a paragraph to explicitly explain the problem formulation. And need one more paragraph to explain why functional label prediction is an important task (naturally motivated by what application scenarios?). 

(3) This reviewer thinks this paper might not be very suitable for the ICLR conference venues (machine learning conference). It is probably more suitable for the domain journal or other conference benchmark tracks if baseline evaluations are further included. This reviewer encourages the authors to make the dataset public. This reviewer thinks probably the most influential dataset format is maintaining the multi-modality, which means including the raw patent text tokens.

### Questions
Will the functional label prediction be a simple task for deep learning approaches? This reviewer conjectures that different functional molecules can have very different structures, which might be easy for deep learning approaches to distinguish between them.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Summary
The paper tackles the task of predicting chemical function from chemical structure by mining patents. The proposed methodology uses GPT3.5 to summarise patents and extract functional labels, which are then cleaned and disambiguated by embedding them with a different GPT model and summarizing the clusters. The final labels are then mapped to the corresponding chemical structures of the chemicals associated with the patent. The authors create the Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100k molecules and the derived functional labels. They show that there is a relationship between the extracted labels and chemical structure of the molecules, by converting the molecules to molecular fingerprints and confirming clusters in the structural space correspond to functional labels when projecting with t-SNE. This finding is further validated by performing a similar analysis on the co-occurrence graph of functional labels. The paper also trains a function prediction model on the molecular fingerprints in the CheF dataset and demonstrates its utility qualitatively on a few real-life examples

### Strengths
- **Originality**: One of the core assumptions of the paper is that relationships between chemical structure and function are present in the language itself. The paper proposes an interesting approach to derive functionality from the language itself, rather than chemical structure, and then shows that the learned functionality corresponds to classes of chemical structure
- **Significance**: Overall, the paper combines SOA approaches like LLMs in a novel and interesting way, in order tackle a hard problem (predicting chemical function). Identification of the mechanistic plausible false positives is interesting and could have significant impact in speed up the process of identifying new drugs for drug repurposing
- **Presentation**: The paper has good structure, and claims follow clearly from experiments

### Weaknesses
- **Evaluation**: The paper assumes that chemical structures with similar functionality should cluster close to each other in the structural space based on molecular fingerprints; however, this doesn’t necessarily have to be the case - you can have stereoisomers with different functional properties, and you can have chemical compounds with different chemical structure and similar labels. Some of this is visible in the cluster analyses, where molecules belonging to the same functional class are not clustered together. Perhaps a different metric to assess congruence of the two spaces is needed.

### Questions
- How is this effort different from recent work on molecular generation from chemical subspaces derived from patents containing specific functional keywords (Subramanian, 2023)?
- What is the classification model used to go from molecular fingerprint to functional label?

Using ChatGPT-assisted patent summarization and word-embedding label cleaning pipeline that paper provides Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100K molecules and their patent-derived functional labels.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and very clear to its points. The authors define the potential of using language models on chemical patent data, and presents .

### Weaknesses
- Detailed figure of the pipeline (may be with a brief example of a patent) may be easier for readers understanding (Figure 1).

### Questions
- Can more validations be carried out by searching over the pubmed?
- Would it be possible to employ the connection of chemicals with genes or diseases to extend the usage in drug repositioning or drug combinations?
- In using LLMs, were there any bias in the generated summarizations?
- What was the reason for using the Tanimoto similarity?
- How long (in terms of time) does the whole framework take?

### Summary
This paper applies large language models for the task of identifying and providing summaries of the functional labels associated with chemical molecules from chemical patents. Through their efforts, the authors introduce the CheF dataset and employ label embedding and clustering techniques to obtain cleaned functionality labels. The paper then offers a comprehensive analysis of the generated dataset.

### Strengths
1.	The research addresses a unique chemical problem by introducing an innovative method for extracting molecule functionality information using ChatGPT. The introduction of the CheF dataset is a commendable contribution that has the potential to benefit the broader chemistry community.
2.	The analysis of the CheF dataset, including  the relationships between the functional labels and the chemical structure space as well as the label co-occurrences, provides valuable insights that enhance readers' comprehension of the dataset.

### Weaknesses
1.	From a technological perspective, the paper's contribution appears somewhat restrained. The use of ChatGPT for text summarization is not a novel concept. As such, the manuscript might find a more fitting audience in journals or conferences with a chemistry focus.
2.	There are concerns regarding the accuracy of labels generated by ChatGPT. While 98.2% of the labels were found valid, solutions for addressing the remaining 1.8% are not discussed. Such inaccuracies could introduce noise into the CheF dataset.
3.	The selection criterion that omits molecules associated with more than 10 patents suggests the dataset may be missing data on prevalent molecules. The absence of these molecules might limit the dataset's reach and implications.
4.	A comparative analysis with other established molecule-text datasets like ChEBI and PubChem would be beneficial. Additionally, the paper could emphasize the practical applications of the CheF dataset, especially its potential role in drug discovery, to underscore its unique advantages.

### Questions
1.	In the Section 3.1 (FUNCTIONAL LABELS MAP TO NATURAL CLUSTERS IN CHEMICAL STRUCTURE SPACE) part, the (a) (e), and (g)  don't appear to distinctly exhibit clustering. Are there more significant examples of other labels?
