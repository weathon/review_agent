# CosPGD: an efficient white-box adversarial attack for pixel-wise prediction tasks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
While neural networks allow highly accurate predictions in many tasks, their lack of robustness towards even slight input perturbations hampers their deployment in many real-world applications.
White-box adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate the model robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for example for attacks on semantic segmentation or on optical flow. 
To streamline the evaluation process, we propose an efficient white-box adversarial attack, termed CosPGD, that can be applied to any pixel-wise prediction task in a unified setting.
To this end, CosPGD employs a simple loss scaling based on the cosine similarity between the distributions over the predictions and ground truth (or target, for targeted attacks).
This leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for pixelwise classification as well as regression models, providing new insights into their performance at earlier attack stages.
We outperform the SotA on semantic segmentation attacks in our experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and CityScapes.
Further, we showcase CosPGD's versatility by evaluating optical flow as well as image restoration models. 
We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cospgd-iclr2024-909/.

### Summary
This paper presents a white-box adversarial attack CosPGD for dense predictions tasks such as semantic segmentation, optical flow and image restoration. CosPGD adopts the cossine similarity to weight the basic PGD attack, which has better interpretability compared to the weight adjustment based on the number of iterations used in SegPGD. Experimental results show CosPGD is strong attack performance in multi tasks.

### Strengths
1. The authors discuss the differences and advantages of PGD and SegPGD.
2. Compared to SegPGD, CosPGD has a broader generality, which can be applied not only to pixel classification tasks but also to pixel regression tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The core of the proposed method is very similar to SegPGD, as both aim to focus on the pixels where the attack has not been successful yet (e.g. pixels with large cosine similarity weight). Therefore, the novelty is limited.
2. Ablation experiments lacking other metrics like cosine distance.
3. Lack of performance comparison experiments with state-of-the-art methods [1] for semantic segmentation tasks.

### Summary
The paper proposed a white-box adversarial attack method CosPGD that considers the cosine similarity between predictions and targets for each pixel.  The authors claimed that CosPGD can be used for various pixel-wise prediction tasks, outperforming existing attacks on semantic segmentation and providing insights into model performance. It is similar to SegPGD and the experiments are insufficient to validate the advantage of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1) The authors introduce the principle and method of CosPGD clearly in **Sec.3**.

2) The universal design for loss function of CosPGD make it be applicable to a wide range of pixel-wise prediction tasks.

### Weaknesses
1) Take the non-targeted attack as an example, the proposed loss function in Eq.(5) $L_{\mathrm{cos}}=\frac{1}{H \times W} \sum_{H \times W} \cos (\overrightarrow{\text { pred }}, \overrightarrow{\text { target }}) \cdot L\left(f_{\text {net }}\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{\text {adv } v}\right), \boldsymbol{Y}\right),$
   is very similar with the loss function of SegPGD[1]  $L_{SegPGD} = \frac{1}{{H}\times{W}} \sum_{j\in P^T} L_j + \frac{1}{{H}\times{W}} \sum_{k\in P^F} L_k$.  Thus, the novelty is limited.

2) Although it claims that CosPGD can be used for various pixel-wise prediction tasks, but it does not bring about significant improvement compared to SegPGD[1] in image restoration task as shown in **Fig.7**, especially with 20 times iterations.

3） In **Sec.4.2** the paper identify their method perform in optical flow task, but it only did experiments compared with PGD[2] in **Fig.5**. I wonder how is the SegPGD[1] perform in optical flow task?

4） In **Sec4.3** the authors said "We observe that at low number of attack iterations (3 attack iterations) it performs significantly worse than PGD, thus demonstrating its limitation on this task." However, the SegPGD[1] is need to adjust their balance factor during the attack iteration, and as far as I know, white box attacks usually don't compare attack performance at low iterations. So I do not think it is fair to compare with SegPGD[1] in 3 attack iterations.

-----------------------------------
After Rebuttal
------------------------------------
Thanks a lot for the authors' rebuttal. The main concern still lies in its novelty.
 (1) While the rebuttal claims that "there are no other attack method scaling the loss pixel-wise using similarity between the posterior and target distributions", which seems a bit trivial and cannot be regarded as a main contribution to this field. 
(2) Although SegPGD can not be directly applied to image restoration, it can be adapted to other supervised learning tasks by doing some simple modifications.
(3) Considering that authors have provided lots of experiments and analysis, I have upgraded the score.

### Summary
This paper proposes CosPGD, a unified white-box adversarial attack aiming to any pixel-wise prediction task based on the cosine similarity between the distributions over the predictions and ground truth. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through a series of experiments across multiple tasks including semantic segmentation, optical flow and image denoising.

### Strengths
First and foremost, in comparison to the recently introduced SegPGD, CosPGD demonstrates a considerably more pronounced adversarial attack impact in semantic segmentation tasks. Notably, what sets CosPGD apart is its applicability beyond segmentation-specific tasks when compared to SegPGD. CosPGD serves as a versatile attack method applicable to any pixel-wise prediction task, boasting efficient deployment capabilities and superior efficacy in contrast to the general PGD method.

### Weaknesses
Section 4.3's content warrants appropriate adjustment. This section primarily showcases the superior degradation effect of CosPGD on NAFNet in comparison to PGD and SegPGD (particularly at low attack iterations). However, this evidence alone may not adequately support the assertion that "CosPGD can efficiently enhance a new model's robustness." To convincingly substantiate this claim, the authors should present more compelling evidence within the main body of the paper, rather than relegating it to the appendix. It is particularly essential to include results from the denoising task (as presented in Appendix D2).

### Questions
1. Although CosPGD exhibits substantial improvements over SegPGD in terms of attack efficacy and generality, it is worth noting that SegPGD also contributes significantly to enhancing model robustness through adversarial training. The absence of corresponding experiments makes it challenging to completely establish the effectiveness of this aspect.

2. An inquiry arises regarding the rationale behind the author's choice of an optical flow experiment to evaluate the versatility of CosPGD. The choice of optical flow as a benchmark should be substantiated by explaining how the characteristics of this task effectively highlight the advantages of CosPGD. Furthermore, additional experiments should be incorporated to showcase CosPGD's performance in various image restoration tasks, such as single image deraining, to bolster its claims further.

3. It seems like the authors need to reorganize the contribution of the paper, since the core of the paper is actually a general improvement on adversarial training for pixelwise classification tasks.

### Summary
This paper concentrates on adversarial attacks tailored for pixel-wise prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, optical flow prediction, and image restoration. 
It uncovers that PGD, a method commonly used in image classification, is not efficient for pixel-wise prediction tasks, and SegPGD, a method designed for semantic segmentation, is not applicable to other pixel-wise tasks. 
The paper introduces CosPGD, an efficient white-box adversarial attack specifically designed for pixel-wise prediction tasks. It utilizes cosine similarity between prediction distributions and ground truth (or target, in the case of targeted attacks) to weight the loss value of each pixel, enabling more effective and nuanced attacks. 
Experimental results across various datasets and settings demonstrate CosPGD's superiority and versatility in assessing the robustness of models for pixel-wise prediction tasks.

### Strengths
1. The proposed CosPGD is a relatively simple modification of SegPGD, yet it significantly enhances effectiveness across multiple datasets. While SegPGD differentiates between pixels that are predicted correctly and those predicted incorrectly during the generation of adversarial examples, assigning different pre-defined weights to the loss terms of correctly and incorrectly predicted pixels, CosPGD replaces these pre-defined weights with cosine similarities between the predictions and ground truth at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate that this modification results in a more effective attack.

2. CosPGD is applicable to a variety of pixel-wise prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation, optical flow prediction, and image restoration. Unlike SegPGD, which is limited to pixel-wise classification tasks, CosPGD can be readily extended to both pixel-wise classification and regression tasks. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of CosPGD on several pixel-wise prediction tasks.

3. There are abundant ablation experiments regarding hyper-parameters such as perturbation bounds, step sizes, and iteration steps, all of which verify the effectiveness of CosPGD compared to previous methods like PGD and SegPGD.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not provide sufficient comparisons and discussions related to recent works in pixel-wise prediction tasks, such as Qu et al. [1], and other applicable attacks in image classification, like C&W [2], and MI-FGSM [3].

[2] Carlini et al. "Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks."
[3] Dong et al. "Boosting Adversarial Attacks with Momentum."

2. Why does using cosine similarity as a weight (in CosPGD) outperform predefined weights (in SegPGD)? Is there a detailed explanation?

3. Why does the paper adopt different settings for the three tasks: non-targeted attacks for semantic segmentation and image restoration, and targeted attacks for optical flow prediction? What about the performance of targeted attacks for semantic segmentation and image restoration?

4. The experimental results presented in Figures 14 and 15 make it challenging to discern the numerical values. Presenting the data in a tabular form would be more beneficial.

5.There is a lack of a detailed definition for $L$ in equations (1), (5), and (6).
