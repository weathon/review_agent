## Abstract
We study a strategic variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which we coin the strategic click-bandit. This model is motivated by applications in online recommendation where the choice of recommended items depends on both the click-through rates and the post-click rewards. Like in classical bandits, rewards follow a fixed unknown distribution. However, we assume that the click-rate of each arm is chosen  strategically by the arm (e.g., a host on Airbnb)  in order to maximize  the number of times it gets clicked. The algorithm designer does not know the post-click rewards nor the arms' actions (i.e., strategically chosen click-rates) in advance, and must learn both values over time. To solve this problem, we design an incentive-aware learning algorithm, UCB-S, which achieves two goals simultaneously: (a) incentivizing desirable arm behavior under uncertainty; (b) minimizing regret by learning unknown parameters.  We approximately characterize all Nash equilibria of the arms under UCB-S and show a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound uniformly in every equilibrium. We also show that incentive-unaware algorithms generally fail to achieve low regret in the strategic click-bandit. Finally, we support our theoretical results by simulations of strategic arm behavior which confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed incentive design.

### Summary
This paper proposes a stochastic bandit problem that models a practical situation where vendors in recommendation platforms exaggerates the true values of their products (arms) to increase CTR, which is inconsistent with the objective of recommendation platforms to find an arm $i$ that maximizes a learner's utility $u(s_i, \mu_i)$, where $s_i$ stands for CTR and $\mu_i$ stands for the true mean reward.

The paper aims to design an algorithm that minimizes strong and weak strategic regrets in the face of strategic vendor behavior (i.e., vendors are aware of the algorithm and strategically select the arm CTR before running the algorithm).
The paper presents an algorithm UCB-S, which maintains a set of arms that are estimated not ``clickbaiting'' with high confidence, and runs UCB among arms in the set.
Problem-dependent and problem-independent strong strategic regret upper bounds of UCB-S are both proved to be sublinear over time.
A weak strategic minimax regret lower bound is also provided.

### Strengths
* The considered problem of clickbait is common and of interest in both industry and academic. The formulation carefully models the learner's utility $u\$ and arm utility $v$, that generalizes a large class of learner's objective.
* It is novel to combine Nash equilibrium and arm strategy selection in bandit literature. I believe that it well captures the real-world situations where clickbaits are under detection.

### Weaknesses
* I feel like it would be more proper and much more interesting if the problem could be modeled by adversarial bandit. Current setting assumes that arms decide their own strategies with knowledge of algorithm in advance (which seems strong to me), and the algorithm is a plain UCB estimating fixed $s$ and $\mu$. However, this problem has the intrinsic of an adversarial strategy selection, that can be well captured by adversarial bandit, in which case, arms dynamically select strategies based on history and thus omit the requirement of knowing algorithm in advance. More importantly, adversarial bandit constructs the interaction between arm strategy selection and learner recommendation/elimination, thus captures real trade-off between incentivizing all arms to be truthful and recommending only the best arms, while current model does not.
* There is confusion in algorithm design and many counterintuitive regret analysis (which I have listed in Questions), that make me doubt the soundness of the results.

### Questions
Modeling:
* The proposed model assumes that arms are aware of the algorithm that the learner is going to run in advance. Is this realistic in practice? Further, it is assumed that arms will pick CTRs that form a NE in $NE(M)$, according to Theorem 5.2, does it imply that arms have to know $K$ and $T$ in advance? I recommend presenting how to pick CTRs to form a NE in $NE(M)$. If $K$, $T$, and algorithm $M$ are required to form a NE before running $M$, it appears that the assumption is too strong.
* According to the description of Model 1, strategies $\bf{\it{s}}$ are picked in advance and stay fixed when running $M$, then, the goal of $M$ becomes maximizing learner's utility by estimating $\bf{\it{s}}$ and $\bf{\mu}$. In this case, why are we interested in strong and weak strategic regret, as they take into account the distribution of strategy selection while strategies are just unknown constants throughout the execution of $M$?

Algorithm design:
* I did not see the explicit definition of $\hat{\mu}^t_i$. Is it an estimate of $\mu_i$? If yes, then it is non-trivial to explicitly state how to get $\hat{\mu}^t_i$ by observing $c_{t, i_t}$ and $r_{t, i_t}$ at each round, and I wonder if Step 4 in UCB-S maximizing $\bar{\mu}^t_i$ aligns with the goal of maximizing $u(\cdot)$.
* The algorithm UCB-S only estimates strategies and eliminates bad arms that seem like clickbait, while arms are responsible to pick proper strategies that are less likely to get eliminated. Although it might be tricky for arms to pick strategies, it seems to me that the design of UCB-S is straightforward UCB.

Regret analysis:
* In Section 4, it is not surprising that $(s, \mu)-$Oracle has linear weak strategic regret, since weak strategic regret considers the strategy distribution $\bf{\sigma}$ while the oracle considers only a realization of $\bf{\sigma}$ (In fact, UCB-S also considers a realization of $\bf{\sigma}$ instead of $\bf{\sigma}$, so I doubt whether UCB-S achieves sublinear strong strategic regret as stated in Theorem 5.3).
* I cannot go through all the proofs, but I can hardly follow the proof of Proposition 4.1. In the first glance, it seems to me that the proof is self-contradictory: in Case 1, it is stated that $u(s'+\varepsilon, \mu_{i^*})<u^*_{j^*}$ with $\varepsilon>0, s'+\varepsilon\leq 1$ contradicts the continuity of $u(s, \mu)$ in $s$, while the proof of Case 2 is based on the statement $u(s'', \mu_{i^*})<u^*_{j^*}$ with $s''>s'$. Please double check the proof.
* Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 5.4 provide a problem-dependent and a problem-independent regret upper bound respectively. It is counterintuitive that the problem-dependent bound is larger than the problem-independent bound, as it is often the case that problem-dependent bound is smaller since it additionally takes into account distributional information.
* As previously mentioned, UCB-S considers a realization of $\bf{\sigma}$ as a fixed unknown parameter, and performs straightforward UCB, so I feel like the problem-dependent regret upper bound in Theorem 5.3 can be tightened to order $\log T$. It is of interest to provide a problem-dependent lower bound to show the tightness of the upper bound.

### Summary
The authors study the problem of combating clickbait via incentive design in a multi-arm bandit framework. The vendors in the system (e.g., content providers in a recommender system) are modeled as strategic arms. Each vendor/arm has a bernoulli reward distribution with fixed mean, and can choose their clickthrough rate. There is a tradeoff in the utility between higher CTRs (which yields higher engagement) and truthfully reporting a ctr that reflects the true reward (disincentivizing clickbait which is modeled as inflating the CTR for low quality content).

The authors show that ignoring vendor incentives can lead to high regret and design an incentive-aware modification of UCB based on thresholding the reported CTRs to derive low-regret guarantees. They characterize the equilibrium strategies of the agents. Finally, they validate the model and techniques via experiments.

### Strengths
The model, while certainly quite stylized, is a neat first step in formulating the incentive issues that arise due to clickbait in the language of bandits. The model is motivated well and explained clearly. The writing is crisp and clear and the paper is overall a pleasure to read. Ultimately I think the paper makes a clear contribution to a growing area of interest; the model, while stylized, is important and will pave the way for future work on aligning vendor incentives with the overall health of the ecosystem.

### Weaknesses
Why does the strategic agent behind an arm get to choose the CTR? Is that a realistic assumption? For example, how could a video creator on Youtube choose their CTR? They could direct effort into improving their content which could contribute to increasing CTR, but allowing the agent to choose the CTR as a fixed value seems like a fairly unrealistic assumption. 

The strategic aspect is interesting, but one limitation of the model is that the agents are in a sense “stuck” at their particular reward mean $\mu_i$. So an agent’s incentive is solely based on strategically choosing a CTR based on the mechanics of the utility function and learning algorithm. But you would expect that realistically an agent might also put in effort into improving $\mu_i$ (e.g., by improving or changing the quality/genre/tone of content they are producing in a recommender system setting). I feel like that’s an important component that would make this model more compelling, and studying the interplay between clickbait actions (strategically choosing $\mu_i$) and quality-improving actions would be very interesting.

I also think some more work and thought needs to be given on the formulation of agent utilities. The present results hold under some assumptions on utilities like Lipschitnzess and monotonicity of maximizers, and the utility is also based on a single-shot report of the strategically-chosen CTR which seems like a limiting assumption since the agents would probably change their behavior across time steps. But these aspects can be a good direction for future work and doesn’t diminish my opinion of the paper too much.

### Questions
I would mainly like to hear the authors thoughts on the first two points in the "weaknesses" section. Namely, (1) How would one go about relaxing the assumption that CTR is a chosen quantity? (2) Can the model be extended to a setting with learning agents who have some degree of flexibility in changing the arm's mean reward?

### Summary
The authors study a strategic MAB problem named strategic click-bait. The application scenario of this problem is the online recommendation systems where the content creators or item providers can strategically manipulate the click rate of the items to any arbitrary value between 0 and 1, where the platform aims to achieve high click through rate as well as the consistency between an item's click through rate and the expected reward (normalized) of the item. The authors show that there exist multiple equilibria in the system and propose the UCB-S (UCB with screening) algorithm to penalize the agents for choosing click rates higher than the estimated reward, and proved that the algorithm has \Tilde{O}(\sqrt{ KT }) regret bound in every equilibrium, which outperforms incentive unaware MAB algorithms.

### Strengths
Despite some discussion on certain details being missing, the overall presentation is good. The problem settings, algorithm, and main results are clearly presented. I haven't checked all the proof details but the theorems follow the intuition.

### Weaknesses
1. The problem setting where the arms can arbitrarily manipulate their click rates from 0 to 1 is an unrealistic assumption. In most real-world online recommendation systems, it is impossible for the item to get arbitrarily close to 1 click rate. There will be limits on the number of items that can appear on the webpage and there will be competition among the item providers, either through sponsors or genuinely improving the item's quality. Due to the limit, only some items will get high click rates but not all. I think the strategic MAB problem is more like an information elicitation problem than a strategic recommendation problem.
2. The UCB-S algorithm is also unrealistic since the punishment is too harsh for any commercial platform. Specifically, the agents are permanently eliminated the first time their report doesn't fall into the estimated expected reward range, and such elimination can be false positives, especially in the early stages of the system. Such false positive eliminations can cause severe regression in brand reputation. I suggest the authors propose alternative solutions that may involve some fixed-length cold-start process to reduce the false positive occurrences or penalize the agents in different ways (like eliminating for a certain period of time instead of permanent elimination), and present the regret bound for the alternatives.
3. It is not easy to understand how the strategic setting in this work is different from previous works in strategic MAB, the authors should consider adding a table with each work's setting, assumptions, solution existence/uniqueness, convergence, and regret bounds to help the readers better understand the novelty.
4. Some details should be elaborated
(1). What is the characterization of NE under the incentive unaware platform? Is it the largest expected reward agent always plays 1 and other agents are indifferent about their strategies? If so, how does this correspond to the result in Figure 3?
(2). Why is UCB-S having higher regret in the early stages than UCB in Figure 4? How is the y-axis value computed?
(3). Under what conditions the NE under UCB-S are pure strategy NE/mixed strategy NE?
5. Minor typo: page 4, "(A3) then ensures that the from the perspective" -> "(A3) then ensures that from the perspective"

I'm on the fence and I think my rating is 5.5, exactly on the borderline since the limitations in the problem setting is really making the UCB-S unrealistic in actual production. I think the theoretical results are interesting, but this is conditioned on my limited experience with the MAB literature.

### Questions
Besides questions in the weaknesses, I have the following questions:

1. Will adding a fixed-length cold-start process keep the same regret bound and reduce the false elimination rate of truthful agents?
2. In a more realistic setting, the agents will need to compete for high click rates, how would you model the problem in this case?
3. What application scenarios other than online recommendations are suitable for implementing UCB-S?

### Summary
The paper defines the strategic click-bandit problem, modeling strategic agents represented by arms in classic MAB setting, who are able to choose a click-rate strategically to maximize the utility of themselves under learner's learning policy. It is proved that classic incentive-unaware learning algorithms will fail in this new setting, and an incentive-aware learning algorithm, UCB-S, which elimates arms based on UCB according to the estimations for optimal click-rates and utilities, is proposed. UCB-S is shown to achieve sublinear regret bound uniformaly in every Nash equilibrium among arms.

### Strengths
1. The model of strategic click-bandit quite novel and interesting. 
2. The theoretical analysis, including ones for incentive-unaware algorithm, new proposed UCB-S, is concrete.
3. The experiments show the robustness of the new proposed algorithm, given each arm running greedy gradient descent.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of the propose strategic click-bandit setting, modeling recommandation systems, is not quite convincing. Basically, vendors are willing to choose proper item descritions to improve its click-rate, but they are not able to controll the click rate. Especially in the motivated example of clickbait, such a behavior is definitely harm the click-rate in long time. However, in proposed the bandit setting, each arm chooses the click-rate arbitrarily and such a probability will be fixed forever.
2. The theoretical analysis is based on the assumption that Nash equilibrium can be achieved by arms, which may be not realistic. On the other hand, the setting in the experiments that each arm optimize itself by gradient descend would be more realistic one, but maybe much harder to obtain theoretical result.
