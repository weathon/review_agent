# Junk DNA Hypothesis: A Task-Centric Angle of LLM Pre-trained Weights through Sparsity

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
The traditional notion of "Junk DNA" has long been linked to non-coding segments within the human genome, constituting roughly 98\% of its composition. Initially perceived as biologically inert, recent research has unveiled the critical roles some of these seemingly non-functional DNA sequences play in cellular processes. Intriguingly, the weights within deep neural networks exhibit a remarkable similarity to the redundancy observed in human genes. It was believed that weights in gigantic models contained excessive redundancy, leading to the conception that a significant number of parameters could be removed without compromising performance.

This paper challenges this conventional wisdom by presenting a compelling **counter-argument**. We employ sparsity (specifically weight pruning) as a tool to isolate and quantify the nuanced significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Our study demonstrates a strong correlation between these weight magnitudes and the knowledge they encapsulate for downstream tasks. Drawing parallels with biological insights, we raise the "**Junk DNA Hypothesis**" backed by our in-depth investigation: while small-magnitude weights may appear nearly "useless" for simple tasks and thus suitable for pruning, they actually encode crucial knowledge necessary for solving more difficult down stream tasks. Removing these seemingly insignificant weights can lead to \underline{irreversible} knowledge forgetting and performance damage in difficult tasks. 

To study it formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics for gauging **downstream task difficulty**: (i) within the same task category, we vary the adequacy of target domain data (e.g., few-shot fine-tuning) and extend this to multi-domain learning (e.g., majority versus minority language in multilingual translation). Additionally, we assess the availability of external information (e.g., open-book versus close-book QA); (ii) across diverse task categories, we utilize the normalized performance gap between humans and models as an indicator of LLM-facing task complexity. Our extensive experiments validate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a spectrum of model scales, tasks, and datasets, employing both forms of sparsity - unstructured and structured (N:M). We also empirically confirm that the essential knowledge indeed resides within the pre-trained weights, and the performance drop does not stem from constrained model capacity post-pruning. These findings offer fresh insights into how LLMs encode knowledge in a task-sensitive manner, present challenges for future research in model pruning, and open avenues for task-aware conditional computation during inference. Codes will be released.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper raises a very interesting argument, that the weights within deep neural networks exhibit a similarity to the redundancy observed in human genes in that they both contain seemingly non-functional elements that play a critical role in their respective systems. This similarity is due to the fact that low-magnitude weights in pre-trained LLMs may appear "useless" for simple tasks and suitable for pruning, but they actually encode crucial knowledge necessary for solving more difficult downstream tasks.

### Strengths
The main strength of this paper, compared to previous pruning works, is its task-centric viewpoint towards pre-trained weights. While it does not propose any new pruning way, the paper adopts a novel approach to isolate and quantify the significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) by examining their correlation with the complexity of the downstream task for which the pre-trained LLM will be employed. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of small-magnitude weights in LLMs and their impact on performance, particularly for complex tasks.

One of the main highlights of this paper is the authors' proposal of a method to quantitative define NLP downstream task difficulty. While this is in general highly ambiguous, the authors proposed (1) Varying the Adequacy of Target Domain Data; (2) Majority v.s. Minority in Multi-Lingual Translation, which essential extends the first setting to multi-domain learning; (3) QA with v.s. without available external Information, and (4) for different task types, as the disparity in performance between humans and models, normalized by human performance. The definition will be broadly useful for understanding LLM (both full and compressed) performance in fine granularity.

### Weaknesses
-	The fourth “cross-task difficulty” definition is flawed.  The authors assumed the larger the positive normalized performance gap between humans and models, the more difficult the task is for the model. However, if both human and LLM perform very poor (but “comparably poor”) on one task, it could mean this task is very difficult, yet in your setting the “relative” gap might not be significant. Besides, as the authors also pointed out, different tasks might have different metrics so directly normalizing and comparing across tasks can be problematic too.
-	It was known before difficult tasks are more fragile for pre-trained model pruning, such as in Sparsity-May-Cry (ICLR 2023). This paper essentially delves deeper on top of this exsiting observation.

### Questions

## Human Reviewer 2

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the importance of the small weights in LLMs. They show that these are indispensable, particularly for harder tasks. The authors embrace a narrative to present similarities between the importance of these (previously thought to be "junk") weights and the junk DNA hypothesis in biology, which hypothesizes the unimportance of huge parts of DNA in humans for certain cellular processes and was proved to be wrong.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written.
- The task-centric approach to the effects of small weights in LLMs is a good contribution to the AI community. 
- The results of the paper are convincing.

### Weaknesses
- Most findings are not that surprising to me, for example, the finding that the small weights in LLMs can be important, or not, and that depends on the task. Nevertheless, this needs to be proved and this paper does it well.
- The paper could be improved if the error margins of the results were evaluated or included in the figures. If this might cause a huge additional computational burden (does it?), at least some statistical analysis of the significance of the results would help.

### Questions
- How do you explain the ups and downs in the figures? Specifically, for example in Fig.6a, the sparse-transfer 3:8 has better result than 4:8 in QNLI, and in Fig. 6b., sparse to dense transfer in CSQA 30% is higher than 20%, etc. Might such ups-and-downs indicate the variance of the results are high, and therefore the results are statistically insignificant?

### Summary
This paper investigates the significance of low-magnitude weights in pre-trained language models and how they affect performance in downstream tasks. The authors suggest a task-centric method to prune pre-trained language models. They illustrate that the small-magnitude weights hold crucial downstream knowledge essential for addressing more difficult tasks, challenging the conventional wisdom regarding the relevance of "Junk DNA" in the human genome and its similarity to the redundancy observed in deep neural networks.

### Strengths
This article introduces three novel discoveries that set it apart from prior techniques for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs) such as essential sparsity, WANDA, and SparseGPT:

1. The paper adopts a task-centric viewpoint when considering pre-trained weights, offering a more holistic comprehension of the function of small-magnitude weights in LLMs and their influence on performance, particularly in complex tasks. This viewpoint is innovative and challenges conventional wisdom.

2. The paper mainly employs magnitude-based pruning to identify and measure the subtle importance of low-magnitude weights. While this approach has been used in previous research, the paper introduces a more nuanced and task-specific application of this technique.

3. The paper challenges the established beliefs regarding the role of "Junk DNA" in the human genome and its similarity to the redundancy observed in deep neural networks. By expanding the Junk DNA Hypothesis to encompass other criteria for weight importance, the paper offers a more comprehensive insight into the significance of low-magnitude weights in LLMs and their impact on performance.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper does not provide another LLM pruning method. As stated above it is mainly considered as a strength (with its simplicity and great clarity). However, it remains uncertain how the magnitude-based pruning approach would yield practical application value because (1) this vanilla pruning technique leads to a rapid decline in performance, and (2) unstructured sparsity is impractical for GPU implementation.

2. Furthermore, the majority of experiments indicate that pruning performance, even for moderately challenging tasks, begins to drop at medium sparsity (around 30-50%). This raises doubts about the potential for any acceleration in LLM inference speed resulting from such pruning techniques.
