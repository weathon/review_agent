# Consistent123: One Image to Highly Consistent 3D Asset Using Case-Aware Diffusion Priors

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image guided by pretrained diffusion models has demonstrated promising outcomes. However, due to utilizing the case-agnostic rigid strategy, their generalization ability to arbitrary cases and the 3D consistency of reconstruction are still poor. In this work, we propose Consistent123, a case-aware two-stage method for highly consistent 3D asset reconstruction from one image with both 2D and 3D diffusion priors. In the first stage, Consistent123 utilizes only 3D structural priors for sufficient geometry exploitation, with a CLIP-based case-aware adaptive detection mechanism embedded within this process. In the second stage, 2D texture priors are introduced and progressively take on a dominant guiding role, delicately sculpting the details of the 3D model. Consistent123 aligns more closely with the evolving trends in guidance requirements, adaptively providing adequate 3D geometric initialization and suitable 2D texture refinement for different objects. Consistent123 can obtain highly 3D-consistent reconstruction and exhibits strong generalization ability across various objects. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image-to-3D methods. See https://Consistent123.github.io for a more comprehensive exploration of our generated 3D assets.

### Summary
The manuscript proposed a pipeline for generating 3D content from a single image. Consistent123 builds upon the 3D prior loss proposed in Zero-1-to-3 [Liu et al, 2023], 2D prior loss proposed in DreamFusion [Poole et al, 2023], and reference image reconstruction loss setup in Magic123 [Qian et al, 2023]. The key insight of the approach is that 3D prior is helpful for generating consistent structures while 2D prior can improve details. Thus, an annealing strategy and CLIP-based switching mechanism are designed to blend the two phases together. Consistent123 is validated on the public available RealFusion15 and a customized C10 dataset.

### Strengths
-	Consistent123 is benchmarked against many recent SOTA baselines for single-image 3D shape generation.
-	The methodology is logically sound based on empirical observations.

### Weaknesses
-	Incomplete ablation experiments
  -	The effectiveness of CLIP-guided termination is never assessed. A simple baseline would be a fixed training iteration set for 3D phase and then switching to the dynamic phase. Moreover, monitoring the change of CLIP-rate can be stuck at local minima and may exhibit large variations across object categories. The heuristics on the threshold $\sigma$ and moveing average length $L$ are also not assessed.
  -	An annealing strategy is used to gradually enable 2D prior, and various experiments are conducted to assess the decaying schedule. However, it is unclear if activating 2D prior in a binary way and prolonging the 3D phase will be more effective. 

-	Experiment setup
  -	While the paper mentions the collection of additional datasets, there is limited information provided about the customized C10 dataset. It's essential to know how many objects are in this dataset and how the 100 views are distributed to assess its representativeness.
  -	The significance of the RealFusion15 results is questioned because only 15 objects were evaluated. The paper should consider conducting experiments on a larger scale, similar to RealFusion on CO3D dataset [Reizenstein et al, 2021], or Zero-1-to-3 on Google Scanned Objects [Downs et al., 2022] and RTMV [Tremblay et al., 2022], where evaluations involve more than 1000 objects.

-	Unclear descriptions of methodology:
  -	Reference view reconstruction on the input image is described but it is unclear at which stage it is applied.
  -	The normal maps are shown in Figure 3 yet the text states Consistent123 uses masks.

-	Unclear descriptions of the experiment
  -	It is unclear if the results are evaluated on the reference image (input) or novel views.
  -	It is unclear which dataset the ablation of Table 2 is performed on.

### Summary
The paper proposes Consistent123, a method for single image 3D reconstruction with text prompts. It is a follow-up work of Magic123 (Qian et al., 2023). To optimize novel views, it uses a two-stage case-aware optimization process. Stage 1 optimizes NeRF with only a 3D prior, i.e., the SDS loss of Zero 1-to-3 (Liu et al., 2023). An adaptive detection mechanism determines when to transition to Stage 2. Stage 2, like Magic123, brings in a 2D prior (the SDS of Stable Diffusion) for texture details, but with scheduling of the 3D-2D ratio over time. Evaluated on RealFusion15 (15 images) and a self-collected C10 dataset (100 images from 10 categories), Consistent123 seems to produce better results than Magic123.

### Strengths
It introduces three major engineering tricks for the optimization: two-stage, CLIP-based stage transition, and diffusion prior ratio scheduling. 

- Two-stage optimization helps mitigate the multi-face/Janus issue while maintaining good texture.
- CLIP-based boundary judgment makes the stage transition automatic and case-aware.
- Diffusion prior ratio scheduling avoids the manual ratio trade-off in Magic123.

### Weaknesses
1. Trivial novelty in the method. Magic123 proposes to trade off the weights of two SDS losses. This work basically finetunes the trader-off process with stage split and scheduling. It is not technically novel. 
2. Insufficient quantitative evaluation. No 3D evaluation is performed to show the overall structural quality. The paper could have rendered some synthetic and scanned 3D meshes for evaluation. PSNR and LPIPS only reflect how much the input/reference view is overfitted in the NeRF. For example, RealFusion cannot generate reasonable geometry but beats Magic123 by a large margin in these two metrics according to Table 1. 
3. Lack of comparisons to some related work. Shap-E (Jun et al., 2023) and One-2-3-45 (Liu et al., 2023) are two SOTA papers in image-to-3D, released earlier than Magic123. However, they are not cited and compared in this paper.
4. Additional prior, unfair comparison: It also needs text prompts as inputs. The paper does not specify how text prompts are prepared for the experiments. But, according to Figure 3., “two donuts” as the text prompt is pretty specific and introduces important additional prior for the optimization. It leads to unfair comparisons with other methods.
5. Potentially increased time cost. The paper does not report the expected time cost for the optimization.
6. The pipeline is engineered to favor 3D prior at the beginning. It may bring some improvements on cherry-picked examples but might deteriorate in other cases.

### Questions
1. The authors fail to acknowledge other previous work in the Sec 3. Methodology. This is not proper. It hinders the readers to know how ideas get inherited. 

    a. Sec. 3.1 follows Make-it-3D and Magic123 to add the normalized negative Pearson correlation depth loss in addition to the common color and mask losses. But the off-the-shelf depth estimator seems changed.

    b. Sec. 3.2 uses the loss of 3D prior (Eq. 4) proposed in Stable DreamFusion’s implementation of Zero 1-to-3. Later, it is adopted in Magic123.

    c. Sec. 3.3 uses the loss of 2D prior (Eq. 7) from DreamFusion. The combined loss (Eq. 8) is following Magic123 but change the coefficient to a timestep-based one.
2. In the explanation of 3D prior (Eq. 4), the authors wrote that “*R* and *T* mean the positional coordinate parameters of the camera.” This is an unprofessional mistake. *R* determines the orientation of the camera, but not the location. 
3. Sec 1. Introduction: In fact, Magic123 cannot “avoid the multi-face issues.” There are even some multi-face shapes on its webpage, such as the multi-head dragon and the multi-beak bird.
4. Objaverse (Deitke et al., 2022) is used to train the important 3D prior (Zero 1-to-3) in this paper. But it is not cited.
5. There is a limitation section but without qualitative examples of failure cases. Also, those results that are not preferred to other methods’ (e.g., Magic123’s) should be also shown.
6. All reference images seem to assume zero elevation. It is pretty common for optimization methods to fail on non-zero-elevation reference images even given the elevation.

The paper was written with many grammatical mistakes, to list a few:

- Abstract: can exhibits → can exhibit
- Page 2 bottom: dataste → dataset.
- Either “on Realfusion” or “on the Realfusion dataset,” but not “on Realfusion dataset.”
- Page 3 top: an case → a case
- Sec. 3.1: The design employ → The design employs

### Summary
This paper proposes a two-stage method for 3D asset reconstruction from one image with both 2D and 3D diffusion priors. In stage 1, only 3D prior is used. In stage 2, both 3D prior and 2D prior are dynamically combined. A CLIP-based similarity score changing rate determines the transition to stage 2. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show better texture and 3D consistency of the assets generated by the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper illustrates a good trade-off strategy of how to combine 3D and 2D prior in optimization.

2. The experiments show good qualitative and quantitative results, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in generating assets with better texture and 3D consistency.

3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Stage 1 and Stage 2 can potentially be merged into one stage by using a dynamic mechanism starting with pure 3D loss and the weight on 3D loss dropping slower at the first several iterations (e.g., $e^{-\frac{t}{\sigma T}}$ with a larger $\sigma$). It would be interesting to see the results comparing the proposed two-stage strategy with the merged one-stage strategy with an optimal $\sigma$.

2. The proposed method needs descriptions of the reference image in stage 2, while the comparison methods may not need such information.

3. In the Optimization Boundary Judgement, a CLIP-based changing rate determines the transition to stage 2. What if the changing rate of other straightforward metrics, e.g., PSNR, is being used instead of the CLIP score? Experiments are desired.

4. Missing citation of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) near equation 7. Should mention "Dreamfusion (Poole et al., 2023)" here. In addition, are equations 4 and 7 losses or gradients?

### Questions

### Summary
The paper introduces a two-stage framework to achieve the highly detailed and consistent 3D reconstruction from a single image, called Consistent123. The proposed methods utilize the generation prior of 2D and 3D, ie. the SDS loss of stable diffusion and Zero123, which can be able to realize the consistent 3D reconstruction from a single image. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the other 3D generation methods

### Strengths
- The paper provides detailed information and evaluations on Consistent123, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of the framework and its implementation.
- The organization is very well-structured and includes more details on the network architecture, and algorithm. It is very easy to follow. The authors provide clear and detailed explanations of the concepts, technical points, and evaluations, ensuring that readers can follow and reproduce the framework effectively.

### Weaknesses
- For the proposed methods, how to avoid the ‘multi-head’ artifacts since the major results do not show the back face of the object, such as in Figure 5? If the methods can handle the cases, could you give some analysis or other evaluation to support them? Otherwise, please make the limitation more clear and show some failure cases, which are more important for the reader and the future direction of the field.
- For equation 3, how to determine the weight of the different losses. The L_depth is not defined if the proposed methods use the depth as the supervision, please explain how to obtain the accurate depth.
- For section 3.3, the name ‘dynamic prior’ is very confusing, I suggest changing it to the ‘adaptive’ prior since equation 8 passes the ‘adaptive’ meaning. For the novel point, I am very curious about the weight changes during the optimization, if there is a visualization, it will be better to understand section 3.3. BTW, what about the difference from the Magic123 for this point? It is very important if the rebuttal provides the explanations.
- What about the running times for generation one 3D shape for stage 1 and stage 2?
- For the ablation studies, depth supervision is also needed to evaluate, as well as the different weight combinations.
- In the experiments, more datasets should be also evaluated, such as NeRF4(proposed in Magic123) and Objaverse(https://objaverse.allenai.org/). Just evaluating on two datasets is weak for the strong 3D generation methods.

### Questions
see weakness

Overall, the paper proposed a novel framework to achieve consistent 3D shape generation with a two-stage optimization strategy. And the evaluation and validation are given more evidence to support the superiority of the proposed methods. However, there are still some unclear issues, weak novelty, and insufficient evaluations (list them as weaknesses). According to these issues, the major concern is the weak novelty (the dynamic prior is very similar to the Magic123), so I lean toward a borderline score for the submission and am looking forward to the response to the above question.
