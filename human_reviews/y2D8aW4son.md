# Capturing The Channel Dependency Completely Via Knowledge-Episodic Memory For Time Series Forecasting

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
The forecasting of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) has long been an important but challenging task, and recent advancements in MTS forecasting methods try to discover both temporal and channel-wise dependencies. However, we explore the nature of MTS and observe two kinds of existed channel dependencies that current methods have difficulty to capture completely. 
One is the evident channel dependency, which can be captured by mixing the channel information directly, and another is the latent channel dependency, which should be captured by finding the intrinsic variable that caused the same changes within MTS.
To address this issue, we introduce the knowledge and episodic memory modules, which gain the specific knowledge and  hard pattern memories with a well-designed recall method, to capture the latent and evident channel dependency respectively.
Further, based on the proposed memory modules, we develop a pattern memory network, which recalls both memories for capturing different channel dependencies completely, for MTS forecasting. Extensive experiments on eight datasets all verify the effectiveness of the proposed memory-based forecasting method.

### Summary
To model the channel dependency completely for MTS forecasting, this paper proposes a SPM-Net that uses a knowledge memory module to summarize the knowledge patterns of intrinsic variables and uses an episodic memory to store and select evident patterns in MTS. Instead of designing complicated models for long-term MTS forecasting, This paper formulates the problem as “prompt-enhanced” forecasting by treating encoded time series representation as queries and finding most similar hard and latent patterns. After concatenating the representations and recalled similar patterns as inputs, this paper uses a linear mapping function for prediction. Experiments on eight real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the model.

### Strengths
* The paper introduces a novel approach to capture channel dependencies in MTS forecasting, addressing both evident and latent dependencies.

* It is a very interesting work that formulates time series as exemplar (hard and latent) matching and simplifies the model architecture. 

* The experiments and ablation studies are detailed to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module.

### Weaknesses
* Lack of the performance comparison of PatchTST and TimeNet, which are two SOTA baselines for LT-MTS forecasting from ICLR2023.

* No clear statements of the default values of \gamma_1 and \gamma_2. Although it has the effect of hard example weight in ablation study, we have two hyperparameters, which causes confusion. 

* Have no concrete data preprocessing explanation, such as normalization, train/val/test splitting ratios for data.

* It is not convincing that channel dependencies are captured from the visualization of the model in 4.4.

### Questions
In the Recall strategy section, we use m to denote the aggregated knowledge patterns but never used again in other paper’s equations. Does it correspond to the output of Recall(M) ?  If yes, better to clear it in the equation 2.

Could you provide more detailed implementation details such as normalization protocols, splitting ratio, optimizer/scheduler etc.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for multivariate time series prediction. The approach is based on knowledge and episodic memory modules to capture channel dependencies across the time series. Authors propose strategies to populate and update each module based on the recall strategy. Linear model is then augmented with these memory modules for improved performance.

### Strengths
I found the memory approach interesting and potentially novel, although memory has been explored extensively in the context of RNNs. Authors also provide extensive empirical evaluation on multiple real world dataset and a detailed ablation study.

### Weaknesses
I found the paper very difficult to read due to grammar and references that point to pages rather than specific equations/figures, please consider revising. While the proposed approach is interesting I don't think the added complexity justifies the performance improvement over the linear model. From Table 1, the results for SPM-Net are nearly identical to Linear except for the long range prediction, and I suspect that most of them will not pass statistical significance so I don't think this method is ready for publication.

### Questions
In the ablation Table 2, why is performance worse than Linear when both memory modules are removed ("w/o both")? I thought that in this case the model would essentially be the same as Linear?

### Summary
This paragraph discusses the importance and challenges of forecasting Multivariate Time Series (MTS), and introduces a memory-based forecasting method proposed in the research. The method aims to capture both latent and evident channel dependencies by utilizing knowledge and episodic memory modules. A pattern memory network is developed to effectively recall these memories and capture different channel dependencies comprehensively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses the important problem of capturing channel dependencies in MTS forecasting, which is a crucial task in various domains such as weather prediction. 

2. The proposed SPM-Net introduces two memory modules that provide a comprehensive approach to capturing both evident and latent channel dependencies. 

3. The inclusion of recall strategies and attention mechanisms effectively mixes channel information from different patterns, enhancing the model's ability to capture dependencies. 

4. The paper provides detailed explanations of the model architecture and the working principles of the memory modules, supported by equations and formulas. 

5. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SPM-Net compared to baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing channel dependencies for MTS forecasting.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper does a good job of introducing the model architecture and memory modules, more detailed explanations of certain components, such as the initialization of knowledge patterns and the selection process for hard patterns, could further enhance the reader's understanding. 

2. The paper could benefit from more thorough discussions about the generalizability of the proposed SPM-Net across different types of MTS data and its limitations in handling noise or outliers. 

3. It would be valuable to provide a comparative analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach compared to existing methods, as it could impact the practicality of the model.

### Summary
This work proposes a Student-like Pattern Memory Network (SPM-Net) for multivariate time series forecasting. The network introduces two memory modules to help describe channel dependencies in MTS. Following previous transformer works, experiments are performed on ETT, weather, electricity, exchange, and illness datasets.

### Strengths
- The use of episodic pattern memory from lifelong learning is interesting.
- The paper includes ablation studies on each component of SPM-Net.

### Weaknesses
Writing: 
- The terminology used in the paper appears to be inappropriate, e.g., 'student-like pattern memory,' 'knowledge pattern memory,' and 'episodic pattern memory.'
- The word 'completely' in the title is inappropriate as there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that the proposed model can **perfectly**  capture the complex dependencies. The proposed SPM-Net just introduces two memory modules to aid prediction.
- Symbols in all equations are not clearly introduced. For example, what are the sizes of W and A in (1)?
- All references are cited incorrectly. Most of them should be cited using \citep{}.
- There are numerous typos and grammar mistakes in the paper.

Model:
- Details of the combination part before outputting the final prediction results are missing.
- It would be beneficial to explain why memory can capture the dependencies and what advantages it has over graph structural learning methods."

Experiments:
- In your released source code, I noticed that in the test set dataloader, you set 'drop_last' to True (batch size=8). However, the Linear (Zeng et al. 2023) paper uses 'drop_last=False' and batch size=32. As you directly use their reported results of Linear for comparisons, there may be some inconsistencies in the experimental setups.
- The training objective (5) of the memory module (knowledge memory) is basically from the paper by Jiang et al. (2023). Thus, it is recommended to include this spatio-temporal baseline in the experiments. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more commonly used spatio-temporal datasets in the experiments, such as METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, as suggested by Jiang et al. (2023).
> [Jiang et al. 2023] AAAI Spatio-Temporal Meta-Graph Learning for Traffic Forecasting 
- Why choose Linear for comparison, not NLinear or DLinear (Zeng et al. 2023)?
- "Figure 2 is somewhat challenging to read. It would be better to display the correlation matrix found by the memories to demonstrate the channel dependencies.

Discussions on channel-independence
- One recent paper, PatchTST, utilizes channel-independence for multivariate time series. Could you provide some insights on the comparisons between the channel-independence and channel-dependency modeling methods?

- For some of the datasets in the paper where the units of variables differ, it is worth considering whether dependency modeling is necessary because PatchTST's performance seems to be good on them by channel independence.
