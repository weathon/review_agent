# JoinGym: An Efficient Query Optimization Environment for Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Join order selection (JOS) is the problem of ordering join operations to minimize total query execution cost and it is the core NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of query optimization.
In this paper, we present JoinGym, a lightweight and easy-to-use query optimization environment for reinforcement learning (RL) that captures both the left-deep and bushy variants of the JOS problem. 
Compared to existing query optimization environments, the key advantages of JoinGym are usability and significantly higher throughput which we accomplish by simulating query executions entirely offline. 
Under the hood, JoinGym simulates a query plan's cost by looking up intermediate result cardinalities from a pre-computed dataset. 
We release a novel cardinality dataset for $3300$ SQL queries based on real IMDb workloads which may be of independent interest, e.g., for cardinality estimation. 
Finally, we extensively benchmark four RL algorithms and find that their cost distributions are heavy-tailed, which motivates future work in risk-sensitive RL. In sum, JoinGym enables users to rapidly prototype RL algorithms on realistic database problems without needing to setup and run live systems.

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The problem of "join plan enumeration" is addressed using the Partially Observable Contextual Markov Decision Process (POCMDP). The authors conducted a comparative evaluation of join order optimization methods that utilize reinforcement learning, using a set of join query plans generated with the proposed technique.

### Strengths
S1: This is a new benchmark paper for various join order optimization methods that utilize reinforcement learning (RL).

S2: The research on join query plan enumeration itself is novel. Additionally, it is valuable for estimating the cost (CCM) for each query plan.

### Weaknesses
W1: The paper will become more valuable by additionally discussing the pros and cons of the compared reinforcement learning (RL) methods and clearly outlining future research challenges.

W2: The proposal enumerates join query plans with its cost model (CCM). Since the proposal utilizes lossy table embedding, it's important to compare the accuracy of the CCM to existing methods, such as Neo (Marcus et al. 2019).

W3: Most parts of the paper heavily rely on knowledge of Markov Decision Process (MDP), which makes it difficult to read. I suggest the authors provide a preliminary overview of MDP to improve readability.

W4: The abstract seems somewhat inconsistent with the main content of the paper. For example, the authors state "key advantages of JOINGYM are usability and significantly higher throughput," but there is no description in the main content that pertains to usability and throughput.

### Summary
The paper proposes a simulator for training RL agents to perform the task of DB query optimization. The main issue that the contribution tackles is the cost of running expensive queries on real hardware which can hinder learning efficiency (from a wall-time perspective) when training deep reinforcement learning agents. This becomes even more problematic in the case of query optimization where the search space is exponential and finding fast-executing query plans is NP-hard. The simulator uses precomputed exact cardinality for each of the possible plans in the search space, which offloads the cost of evaluating plan performance (and therefore collecting a reward) to the developers of the simulator rather than the user. The authors release the queries and intermediate relation cardinality estimates which can also be used for learning cardinality estimation models. Many RL algorithms are benchmarked using this RL environment.

### Strengths
Many reinforcement learning algorithms are benchmarked against the proposed simulator and the release of the dataset along with the precomputed IR cardinalities will be of use to the database and QO research communities. The background on database query optimization and traditional QO optimizations (e.g. left-deep vs bushy) also helps contextualize the contribution to the broader machine learning community and is presented well.

### Weaknesses
With respect to the analysis of the environment and the cost models associated, the paper does not benchmark against performance of existing RL-for-QO systems, such as Neo (Marcus et. al) which do indeed use expensive execution frameworks. Additionally, more traditional cost models which approximate the IR estimates such as the Postgres cost model should be evaluated to solidify that precomputing the IR estimates manually is necessary for strong performance. Ideally, showing a curve of environment cost vs. learning performance curve would be useful (e.g. does using real execution latencies improve over the exact IR cardinalities which improves over the Postgres cost model?).

The dataset for learning supervised cardinality estimators is not benchmarked against other methods for learning cardinality estimators (both supervised and unsupervised) and should be benchmarked to better contextualize the contribution for the broader ML and systems community as to the datasets potential impact with respect to training estimators.

### Questions
Installing postgres and querying the cost model is not particularly expensive or difficult and could be packaged into software such as an OpenAI gym environment. How does the performance compare when using the postgres cost model? What about using more advanced cardinality estimators, such as NeuroCard (Yang et al) as the cost model for the JoinGym simulator?

What is the performance on JOB-Ext (Marcus et al, available https://github.com/RyanMarcus/imdb_pg_dataset/tree/master/job_extended) which are out-of-domain queries and not from the original JOB templates? 

How does the method generalize to new schemas?

### Summary
The work is related to applying reinforcement learning to decide how a join query (a query that cross-references multiple tables) can be executed most efficiently by a database system which is an NP-hard problem where existing solutions still leave a lot of room for improvement. The paper proposes a simulator/benchmark to evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning approaches and features an extensive empirical study that compares some existing approaches.

### Strengths
S1) Originality: Thorough investigation of existing reinforcement learning approaches and useful tool/benchmark for future works.

S2) Significance: Reinforcement learning is a reasonable approach for the join order problem and shedding light on what works best can contribute towards faster join execution not just in general, but also for particular data domains / systems.

S3) Presentation: The paper presents ideas clearly, particularly figures seem to illuminate concepts well and the literature review appears to be thorough.

### Weaknesses
W1) Significance: The conclusion of compared reinforcement learning approaches could be clearer in terms of which kind of predictions it enables. A non-learning baseline would also help to root the results.

W2) Originality: The work does not seem to (explicitly) propose any novel approach.

W3) Relevance: The focus of the paper seems to be less on reinforcement learning and more about a particular application of reinforcement learning in database management systems.

### Questions
Q1) What can be learned about the performance of different reinforcement learning approaches in this benchmark and how does it compare to the performance of a non-learning approach (as used in modern commercial systems)?

Q2) Do the any of the results conclude any new approach or variation of an approach that has not been previously considered?

Q3) What kind of progress does this work make in terms of reinforcement learning approaches (e.g., via trial and error) beyond measuring their empirical performance?

### Summary
This paper proposes a lightweight query optimization environment for reinforcement learning and releases a cardinality dataset based on IMDB.

### Strengths
1.This paper focus on an important problem for query optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. The title of the article is very strange and difficult to understand. The ‘query optimization’ is the background of this paper. The title may be “An efficient reinforcement learning environment for query optimization” instead of “An efficient query optimization environment for reinforcement learning”?
2. Do the ‘simulator’ and ‘environment’ refer to the same thing? Authors mention that ‘our aim is to provide a lightweight yet realistic simulator’ and ‘looking up the size of intermediate tables from join sequences’. The size or called cardinality estimation is a popular research filed in query optimization. They should compare their method to the existing query size simulators as follows.

3. Many statements of this paper are incorrect. For example, authors mention ‘runtime metrics are system-dependent and can only be obtained from live query executions’. In fact, there exists many popular works to simulate the query size and cost [1,2,3,4].
4. This article needs to be greatly improved in algorithm, experiment and writing before it can be accepted.
