## Abstract
We present a novel training approach, named Bound-and-Average (BaA) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) that leverages weight ensemble and constrained optimization, motivated by recent advances in transfer learning. Our algorithm contains two types of weight averaging: inter-task weight averaging and intra-task weight averaging. Inter-task weight averaging integrates the ability of previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight averaging enriches the learning of current task by averaging the model parameters within current stage. We also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. BaA seamlessly integrates into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Summary
This paper Bound-and-Average (BaA) for Class Incremental Learning which consists of weight ensemble and constrained optimization. The weighted ensemble contains the inter-task weight average and intra-task weight average. The inter-task weight average is proposed to maintain knowledge of previous stages and the intra-task weight average is proposed to enhance the learning of the current stage. Moreover, a bounded update technique is proposed to preserve knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed BaA can improve existing CIL methods.

### Strengths
The proposed method BaA is simple but effective, and the method can be integrated into existing methods to improve the performance without modifying their algorithm or architecture.

### Weaknesses
(1) The contribution of this paper appears to be insufficient to fully support the article. Similar EMA methods are widely used in self-supervised learning and some incremental learning methods [1,2].

(2) Lack of analysis experiments or visualization about how the proposed weight average mitigates the forgetting issue.

(3) Tables 1 and 2 show that BaA can improve the performance of certain CIL methods. Experiments on the latest CIL methods in 2023 should be done to show that the BaA can also be integrated into the SOTA methods.

### Questions
In Table 3, the results of the experiment are somewhat perplexing as the average new accuracy appears to be lower than the overall accuracy. In my assessment, the new accuracy represents the precision of classes of the current task, and the overall accuracy is expected to be lower than the average new accuracy due to knowledge forgetting.

### Summary
The paper tackles the problem of class incremental learning by proposing weight-average techniques and bounded optimization. For weight averaging, both inter-task and intra-task weight ensembles are used. It was evaluated in conventional benchmarks with some improvements.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
(2) The online ensemble of old models is efficient.
(3) The method is integrated into three methods and the performance gain is clear.
(4) The ablation study of different components is thorough.

### Weaknesses
(1) The weight-average strategies are already used in some CL methods [A, B, C], it would be good to discuss the differences and the novelty compared to these existing methods.
(2) The section of Bounded model update seems just a direct application of the existing method, the novelty is limited. The performance improvement of this section shown in the experiments is only marginal (see Table 3 and Table 7).
(3) Some sentences are unclear. for instance, the Select() operation in Eq.2 is confusing; The threshold B in Eq. 4 is not dynamically determined but fixed, which sounds weird to me.
(4) More recent related work can be considered, especially papers published in 2023.
(5) Figure 3 shows the similarity between different models, and the lowest value is 0.9, It is unclear what it means for the two figures.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method called "Bound-and-Average (BaA)" for Class Incremental Learning (CIL). BaA integrates weight ensemble and constrained optimization, reducing the forgetting of knowledge from previous tasks when learning new ones. It contains two types of weight averaging: inter-task averaging and intra-task averaging. This approach requires no modifications to existing CIL architectures or learning objectives and demonstrates performance improvements on standard CIL benchmarks.

### Strengths
1) The approach is straightforward to understand. The introduction section clearly explains the motivation of the proposed method. The illustrations and discussions are clear.

2) Ablation studies effectively showcase how each part of the proposed method contributes to its overall performance.

### Weaknesses
1) The novelty of the method is limited. The idea of model averaging is simple, following many previous ensemble methods. Furthermore, the authors claim "which can be conveniently integrated into existing CIL methods", but there are already many methods that can similarly be incorporated into past models and have achieved good results [Xu H et al., 2020, Simon C et al., 2021, Hu X et al., 2021]. The proposed method is not compared with these methods.

2) There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. From the experimental results in Table 1, when compared with newer saved sample methods, the performance improvement of this method has reduced significantly, dropping from 2.86% to 0.8%. However, Foster is not the current SOTA method. For example, [Yan S et al., 2021] and [Chen X et al., 2023] both perform much better than Foster. There is a lack of experimental results with BaA and these methods to prove its effectiveness.

3) The proposed method requires calculating the average value of all previous task models. This means it needs to store all the models from previous tasks, incurring significant amount of memory. Especially when compared with methods that do not save samples, this results in an unfair comparison.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The submission proposes to tackle the class-incremental learning problem with inter-task and intra-task weight averaging. The former facilitates the incorporation of previous knowledge so as to counter catastrophic forgetting, while the latter enhances the performance of the current task model. They further include the bounded parameter update to regularize the parameter changes, which strengthens the effect of avoiding forgetting. They validate their method on multiple class-incremental datasets and achieve competitive results.

### Strengths
- The authors propose to utilize current weight averaging and bounded model update techniques to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of comparison with a highly relevant method. [1] also proposes to utilize the previous knowledge with ‘inter-task ensemble’, while enhancing the current task’s performance with ‘intra-task’ ensemble. Yet, the authors didn’t include the method comparison or performance comparison.

- Novelty is limited. From my perspective, the submission simply applies the existing weight averaging and the bounded update to the class incremental learning problems.

- No theoretical justification or interpretation. Is there any theoretical guarantee that to what extent inter-task weight averaging or bounded update counter catastrophic forgetting?

- Though it shows in Table 3 that bounded model update mitigates the forgetting, the incorporation of bounded model update doesn’t seem to have enough motivation from the methodological perspective. The inter-task weight average is designed to incorporate both old and new knowledge, which is by design enough to tackle forgetting.
