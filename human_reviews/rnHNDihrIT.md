## Abstract
Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework. Experimental evaluations across multiple environments demonstrate the significant superiority of SORL over previous methods in extracting high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. A case in point is that SORL successfully learns strong policies with markedly distinct playing patterns from a real-world human dataset of a popular basketball video game "Dunk City Dynasty."

### Summary
This paper introduces an EM-inspired algorithm called Stylized Offline RL (SORL) to extract diverse strategies from heterogeneous offline RL datasets. Based on the learned behavior policies, the paper then applies an advantage-weighted style learning algorithm to improve their performance further. The authors demonstrated their algorithm's effectiveness with experiments on six Atari games and one online mobile basketball game, where SORL outperforms other baselines regarding quality, diversity, and consistency.

### Strengths
Extracting diverse behaviors from an offline RL dataset is an interesting problem. SORL efficiently solves the problem following an EM-based approach. The proposed evaluation criteria, considering quality, diversity, and consistency, provide a nice guideline for other researchers to follow. The algorithm also performs better than other existing baselines in multiple offline RL datasets, including the "Dunk City Diversity" dataset, which contains extremely diverse behaviors. Finally, the paper is overall well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. There is no theoretical ground for naively replacing $A^{\mu^{(i)}}$ with $A^\mu$ without importance sampling corrections. At least an empirical ablation study should be provided if it is difficult to devise a theoretical justification.

2. It isn't easy to understand the proof presented in Appendix B.

    (1) $\pi^{(i)}$ needs to satisfy the constraint $\int \pi^{(i)}(a\mid s)\,da=1$ for all $s$. The optimal solution might not be a critical point.

    (2) $A^\mu(s, a)-\lambda \mu^{(i)}(a\mid s)+\lambda \pi^{(i)}(a\mid s)+\lambda=0$ does not imply $\pi^{(i)*}(a\mid s)\propto \mu^{(i)}(a\mid s)\exp(\frac{1}{\lambda}A^\mu(s, a))$.

    (3) The normalization constant for $\pi^{(i)*}$ is ignored in (14).

3. The diversity metric proposed by the authors does not consider how different the styles are. For example, consider the case where $\pi^{(i)}(a=k\mid s)=\frac{1}{K}+\epsilon_k(s)$ where $K$ is the number of possible actions and $\epsilon_k(s)$ is a small number chosen arbitrarily. Then $\hat{p}(z=j\mid traj)$ would be determined by the values of $\epsilon_k(s)$, so $p_{popularity}$ would be close to a uniform distribution, which is the distribution that maximizes the entropy. However, the learned styles are far from being diverse.

### Minor comments:

1. How about using $\tau$ instead of $traj$? I think this notation is widely accepted.

2. The $-$ sign seems missing in (9).

3. §5.1 Off-RLMPP → Off-RLPMM (appears twice on the fourth line)

4. Appendix B: Unmatched parentheses $($ in (13) and on the first line of p.15

5. Appendix B: $exp$ → $\exp$ on the second line of p.15 and in the second and third equation of (14)

6. Appendix B: In (14), $t$ is the index of summation, but it does not appear in the summand.

7. Appendix B: Second $=$ → $\approx$

### Questions
1. §5.3 states that the character has to combat against an AI opponent. What is the strategy of the opponent? Is SORL robust to the changes in the opponent's strategy?

2. All experiments were conducted on environments with discrete action spaces. How does SORL perform in continuous action environments?

3. How was the diversity metric measured for InfoGAIL? To my knowledge, InfoGAIL does not explicitly split the policy into multiple clusters but instead learns a multi-modal policy.

4. In Appendix C, the paper states that

   > Besides, in order to ensure balanced learning among all the styles, we share the main network and use a lora module to discriminate different styles.

   The explanation on the "lora" module seems missing. Also, I recommend moving this part to the main paper.

### Summary
This paper discusses the problem of extracting diverse as well as high-quality policies from multi-modal datasets via offline reinforcement learning. The core of the proposed method lies in clustering trajectories within the dataset. Behavior policyies to induce such clusters are learned, which are later used for constraining policy learning to ensure that the offline RL policies are high-performing as well as aligning with the diverse multi-modal dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted, and results seem positive. But I still have some concerns for this paper, please refer to the weaknesses.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is straightforward and easy to comprehend.
2. Extensive experiments are conducted. Resutls on all three benchmarks show the proposed method SORL achieves balance between performance and diversity of the learned policies.
3. Procedure of SORL is clearly described.

### Weaknesses
1. Transformation from the true posterior to Eq. 2 needs more explanation. The current context is too weak. And I assume the basic assumption for this transformation is that all behavior policies $\mu_{1,..,m}$ are diverse enough, because the authors use transtion-wise action probability to replace the trajectory probability. This makes sense if behavior policies are diverse enough that they take different actions for each step. But if the policies only slightly differ from each other, the consecutive multiplication of all steps within the trajectory will make their trajectory distributions very different from each other (while the action distribution is not much different). As a result, Eq. 2 provides very inaccurate estimation of the posterior.
2. The proposed SORL needs to know the number $m$ of policy primitives constituting the dataset in order to learn the diverse policies. But it is hard to know this prior under many ciucumstances. I think there should be a study about how sensitive SORL is  to this hyperparameter.
3. How diverse are the induced policies? The case studies are great but there should be a quantitive study. My further question on this is, if we set $m$ larger than the actual number of policy primitives $\mu_{1,..,m}$, what will the resulted policies be like?
4. Some typos, e.g. line 10 in Algorithem 1: $\mu^{i}$ instead of $\mu^{1}$
5. As the author claims the induced policies are high-performing, the baselines should include some strong offline RL methods for comparison. This will also show SORL's advantage in policy diversity compared to them. The current baselines are too few.
6. How do the authors collect online user data? Where is the user agreement to collect this data? This should appear at least in the appendix.

### Questions
Please refer to the weaknesses. If the authors can address my concerns, I'm happy to increase my score.

### Summary
This paper presents a new approach, Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which seeks to derive high-quality, stylistically diverse policies from offline datasets with distinct behavioral patterns. While most reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies prioritize either online interactions or policy performance, SORL combines the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with trajectory clustering and advantage-weighted style learning to promote policy diversification and performance enhancement. Through experiments, SORL has been shown to outperform previous methods in generating high-quality and diverse policies, with a notable application being in the basketball video game "Dunk City Dynasty". The effectiveness of SORL is evaluated in various settings, including a basketball video game. Compared to other methods, SORL consistently yields better-performing policies that also maintain distinct behavior patterns. The paper's contributions include:
* The introduction of SORL, a framework that combines quality and diversity into the optimization objective, addressing limitations in both diverse RL and offline RL methods.
* Extensive evaluations showing SORL's ability to generate high-quality, stylistically diverse policies from diverse offline datasets, including human-recorded data.

### Strengths
1.	The structure of the paper is clear and easy to understand. 
2.	The idea of using the EM framework to do trajectory clustering and policy optimization is interesting. 
3.	Using offline RL to solve real-world tasks using a human-generated dataset shows the scalability of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1.	No standard Offline RL baseline compared. As quality and diversity are both metrics for evaluation, it would be good to compare the performance with other standard offline RL methods, e.g., CQL, TD3+BC, AWR. 
2.	The motivation for increasing the diversity of policy is not clear. In the related work section, the authors only discuss the importance of diversity in online RL settings, for example, encouraging exploration, better opponent modeling, and skill discovery. However, in the offline RL setting, there is no exploration problem or skill discovery since the dataset is fixed. In addition, in the preliminary section, the authors aim to “learn a set of high-quality and diverse policies” without any explanation of the advantage of learning a set of diverse policies over a single policy with diverse behaviors (e.g., using multi-modal distribution as policy distribution).
3.	Many details are missing in the experiment of the “Dunk City Dynasty”. The code does not include this experiment.

### Questions
1.	The metric for evaluating diversity seems to rely on the learned clustering p. I wonder why don’t evaluate the diversity of the learned policy? Otherwise, this metric cannot be used for algorithms that don’t learn the clustering of datasets. In addition, the goal of clustering the dataset is to learn diverse policies for online evaluation, so the diversity of the policy is what we really care about.
2.	Could the authors provide some visualization or example of the mean of the clusters in Atari games? It is not intuitive how the diverse behavior looks like in those games. Similarly, in the Dunk City Dynasty game, the visualization in Figure 3 is too simple. Could the authors plot the shooting positions of each policy? Also, besides the shooting position, are there other differences between these policies?
3.	Could the authors provide more details about the setting of the Dunk City Dynasty experiments? For example, the action space, and model structure. Appendix C only describes the structure of the first two experiments. 
4.	What does it mean by “we share the main network and use a lora module to discriminate different styles.” In Appendix C?
5.	Results in Table 3 show that SORL has a very high variance (5.3 ± 3.4) in terms of quality, which only slightly outperforms InfoGAIL (5.0 ± 0.8). Does this mean pursuing high-quality sacrifices for the performance of the policy? Then, what do we gain from the high diversity?

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of learning diverse policies based on datasets of trajectories collected by humans. This is particularly relevant in the context of video gaming, where the goal is to develop bots that are not only proficient but also exhibit varied behavioral patterns based on human player data. The authors introduce a purely offline solution that eliminates the need for environmental interaction. This approach is underpinned by a dual-step method. Initially, a clustering technique, leveraging the EM algorithm, assigns trajectories to different clusters by learning  a style-sensitive policy. Subsequently, to foster policies that are both effective and stylistically aligned, Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) is employed in conjunction with a style-regularization component based on the style-sebsitive policies. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a series of tests conducted in a simplistic environment, a handful of Atari games, and a commercial video game, all of which confirm the algorithm's capability to generate diverse and competent policies.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and will be of the interest of a large audience. The model is quite simple (clustering then offline learning) and easy to apply to different use-cases, it can be a good baseline for many future works.  More importantly, as far as I know, this paper is the first one to propose a set of experiments on a real video game and a large dataset of collected traces which is certainly where this paper has the most value and the dataset and  environment will be release (can you confirm I am right on that point ?)

### Weaknesses
The paper presents a compelling methodology, yet it notably omits a benchmark against "robust imitation of diverse behaviors," which is a reference work within this domain. Although primarily an online training paper, like infoGAIL, its principles could potentially be adapted for offline training, serving as a relevant comparison.

There appears to be an implied relationship between what the authors denote as 'style' and the rewards associated with a particular trajectory. Commonly, one might categorize trajectories by skill level, segregating expert from intermediate or novice plays. However, in such a scenario, the operation of the Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) on these distinct clusters is not thoroughly explained. The connection between the 'style' of play and the 'reward' outcome merits a deeper examination.

The simplicity of the clustering model raises concerns regarding its ability to discern more nuanced styles, such as specific repetitive actions (e.g., "jump twice"). A more critical discussion on the model's capacity to identify and differentiate between complex styles would enhance the paper.The algorithm seems limited in capturing policies that would need memory to characteriwe their styles.

Regarding the implementation of AWR, it seems to be applied to each cluster individually. This approach suggests that in a situation where ten clusters are identified, only one-tenth of the training trajectories are utilized during the AWR phase for each cluster. This potentially limits the method's scalability when dealing with numerous styles, possibly making it impractical for extensive style differentiation.

Lastly, the paper could explore the potential of employing more advanced offline reinforcement learning algorithms in the second step of the methodology. Such a discussion could provide insights into improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process in diversifying policies.
