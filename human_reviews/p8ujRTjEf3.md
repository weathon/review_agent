## Abstract
Most bandit algorithms assume that the reward variances or their upper bounds are known, and that they are the same for all arms. This naturally leads to suboptimal performance and higher regret due to variance overestimation. On the other hand, underestimated reward variances may lead to linear regret due to committing early to a suboptimal arm. This motivated prior works on variance-adaptive frequentist algorithms, which have strong instance-dependent regret bounds but cannot incorporate prior knowledge on reward variances. We lay foundations for the Bayesian setting, which incorporates prior knowledge. This results in lower regret in practice, since the prior is used in the algorithm design, and also improved regret guarantees. Specifically, we study Gaussian bandits with \emph{unknown heterogeneous reward variances} and develop a Thompson sampling algorithm with prior-dependent Bayes regret bounds. We achieve lower regret with lower reward variances and more informative priors on them, which is precisely why we pay only for what is uncertain. This is the first such result in the bandit literature. Finally, we corroborate our theory with experiments, which demonstrate the benefit of our variance-adaptive Bayesian algorithm over prior frequentist works. We also show that our approach is robust to model misspecification and can be applied with estimated priors.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The submission studied multi-armed bandits. The reward-generating process of each arm follows a different Gaussian-Gamma distribution. The submission proposed two Bayesian methods (Algorithms 1 and 2) and provided two prior-dependent regret bounds (Theorems 1 and 2). The proposed method (VarTS) is compared with seven existing methods in experiments.

### Strengths
The submission addresses the unknown reward variance. The regret is a finite-time analysis, and the bounds show how the reward variance affects the regret.

### Weaknesses
(a) Assuming Gaussian bandits would be impractical when facing realistic applications. As a complement, the analysis should discuss the cost of mis-modeling and show how to control this additional cost to obtain a meaningful regret bound. (In contrast, the experiments indeed consider distributions other than Gaussian.)

(b) The submission lacks a clarification that connects the novelty claimed in Contribution-(3) to the analysis in the appendix. This information would help evaluate and understand the technical contribution(s) of this submission.

(c) The variance-dependent bounds (Theorems 1 and 2) would be better justified if we could see curves of the proposed methods that vary according to the change of the unknown parameters in experiments.

### Questions
(d) The main paper categorizes the methods using Bayesian/frequentist approaches or the identical $\sigma$/distinct $\sigma_i$ settings. Could you please also reflect on these different baselines in the experiments, helping the reader to compare and contrast the differences between considering/not considering the prior information?

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing bandit algorithms in the context of varying reward variances. Most bandit algorithms assume fixed reward variances or upper bounds on them, leading to suboptimal performance due to the inaccurate estimation of these variances. In this work, the authors lay the foundation for a Bayesian approach that incorporates prior knowledge about reward variances, resulting in lower regret and improved performance. They specifically focus on Gaussian bandits with unknown heterogeneous reward variances and develop a Thompson sampling algorithm with prior-dependent Bayes regret bounds.

### Strengths
They introduce a Thompson sampling algorithm for Gaussian bandits with known heterogeneous reward variances and provide regret bounds that decrease as reward variances decrease. This is a significant advancement in the context of bandit algorithms.

They propose a Thompson sampling algorithm (VarTS) for Gaussian bandits with unknown heterogeneous reward variances. VarTS maintains a joint Gaussian-Gamma posterior for mean rewards and precision, resulting in Bayes regret bounds that decrease with lower reward variances and more informative priors.

The paper thoroughly evaluates VarTS on various reward distributions, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines. The results highlight the generality and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

The work distinguishes itself from prior research by providing strong finite-time regret guarantees, as opposed to asymptotic bounds.

They discuss the differences between their Bayesian approach and frequentist algorithms, highlighting the ability to leverage more informative priors in their design

### Weaknesses
The paper primarily focuses on Gaussian bandits with heterogeneous reward variances. While this is a significant step, the approach may not be directly applicable to other types of bandit problems with different reward distributions. The generalizability of the proposed method to various scenarios is not thoroughly explored.

Bayesian regret is often considered as easier than frequentist regret.

You may need to cite https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06613 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11182 as they analysed a Gaussian thompson sampling policy in a quite general setting which is related and relevant to the present paper.

I was thinking the Gaussian-Gamma prior was already used for the analysis of TS, but it seems that I am wrong since I cound not find back the ref.

### Questions
I am not convinced that this is a fundamental step in dealing with the problem of the general case of unknown variance in the case of non-Gaussian reward. Can you give more details on this ?

### Summary
The authors investigate Gaussian bandits with heterogeneous reward variances, both known and unknown. For known variances, they introduce a Thompson sampling algorithm, achieving a Bayes regret bound that decreases as variances decrease. When variances are unknown, they present the VarTS algorithm, which employs a joint Gaussian-Gamma posterior for the mean and precision of all arm rewards. They establish a Bayes regret bound for VarTS that decreases with decreasing variances and stronger priors. Extensive experiments confirm VarTS's efficacy across different reward distributions.

### Strengths
1) This paper pioneers the study of Gaussian bandits with unknown heterogeneous reward variances and introduces the VarTS algorithm, leveraging a Gaussian-Gamma posterior for the task.
2) The authors provide Bayes regret bounds that captures the effect of the prior on learning reward variances for Gaussian bandits with both known and unknown heterogeneous reward variances. The regret analysis for the unknown variance scenario is novel.
3) Numerical experiments encompass not just Gaussian but also Bernoulli and beta distributions, demonstrating the generality and robustness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1) As mentioned on page 5, the finite-time Bayes regret lower bound for Gaussian bandits remains unresolved, making the optimality of the Bayes regret bounds in Theorems 1 and 2 ambiguous. Furthermore, the current optimality discussion focuses on the order of $K, n$, but there should also be a discussion on its dependency on the prior and reward variances.
2) The algorithm design for Gaussian bandits with unknown heterogeneous rewards seems as standard as the typical TS algorithm.

### Questions
1) The detailed proof of Theorem 2 stands out as the main technical contribution in the paper. However, the current discussion on page 6 is somewhat succinct. A more in-depth exploration of the core ideas behind the proof would greatly benefit readers in grasping its implications.
2) Is it possible to derive finite-time prior-dependent regret bound for Bernoulli TS or Beta TS?

### Summary
This paper studies the two-parameter Thompson Sampling with Bayesian regret. When the variance is known, the regret bound presented in this paper scales as $\sqrt{n\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sigma_i^2}\cdot \log n$, which is optimal up to a $\log n$ factor. In the case of unknown variance, the regret bound resembles that of the known variance scenario. Experimental findings indicate that the Thompson Sampling algorithm introduced in this study outperforms other baseline methods, including UCB and traditional Thompson Sampling.

### Strengths
See summary.

### Weaknesses
However, there are certain limitations to this paper:

1. The techniques used to prove Bayesian regret have been extensively explored in previous literature and are considerably more straightforward than those for frequentist regret. More crucially, Bayesian regret is a subset of frequentist regret. This is because the latter always implies Bayesian regret, but the reverse is not true. 
2. The regret bound presented is not particularly stringent. It is a log n factor away from the optimal regret.
3. The paper omits some crucial related work such as: 
    (1) Minimax policies for adversarial and stochastic bandits;
    (2) Mots: minimax optimal thompson sampling;
    (3) A minimax and asymptotically optimal algorithm for stochastic bandits;
    (4) Prior-free and prior-dependent regret bounds for thompson sampling
    (5) Thompson Sampling with less exploration is fast and optimal. It would be beneficial to see the baselines (2) (3) and (5) incorporated into the experiments.
4. The experimental framework is anchored in the Bayesian context. It would be enlightening to witness experiments in the general setting, i.e., no prior on the means and variance of arms.

### Questions
In Bayesian analysis, regret bounds are typically derived using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) method, as illustrated in works like "Prior-free and prior-dependent regret bounds for Thompson Sampling." However, this paper presents an alternative approach. It raises the question of whether it is possible to obtain the regret bound through a UCB method.

### Summary
This work develops a new Thompson sampling algorithm and proves prior-dependent Bayes regret bounds for K-armed Gaussian bandits. It studies the problem in both settings where the reward variances are known and unknown. The algorithm can achieve lower regret when the
reward variances are low, which indicates the trade-off of the learner’s performance (regret) versus the prior parameters and reward
variances. The authors evaluate their new algorithms with numerical experiments comparing with other baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well organized. The presentation is unambiguous.
2. The paper provides a new regret bound dependent on reward variances and informative priors.
3. The paper conducts numerical experiments to justify the main results.

### Weaknesses
1. The variance aware regret bound depends on the summation of the variance across all the arms $\sum_{i=1}^K \sigma_i^2$. This can 
 reduce the dependency of the number of arms $K$ to a variance-dependent result. However, the standard method to deal with large $K$ is to use function approximation. I feel confused about the relationship of these two methods. Can the result in this work be generalized to the bandit problem with function approximation?
2. The Bayesian regret studied in this work is usually weaker than the frequentist regret.
3. Algorithm 2 is under the standard Thompson sampling framework, and the posterior sampling updates seem similar to previous works, for example, [Zhu & Tan., 2020].  Are there any novel techniques in the algorithm design, or do the new results come from the analysis?
4. There are some mistakes in the literature review. In the study of $d$-dimensional linear contextual bandits, they did not always keep the fixed variance across the arms. For example, in [Kim et al., 2022] and  [Zhao et al.,2023] mentioned in the paper, the stochastic noise at time step $k$, $\epsilon_k$, is a random variable dependent on $\mathcal F_k = \sigma(x_1,\epsilon_1,\ldots,x_{k-1},\epsilon_{k-1}, x_k)$ with $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_k | \mathcal F_k] = 0$ and $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_k^2 | \mathcal F_k] = \sigma_k^2$. They do not assume the variances are fixed across arms.
5. Some typos: should the bound in page 7 be $\tilde O(C\sqrt{n})$?

=============== Post Rebuttal ===================

Thanks for the response for the authors. After reading what the authors mentioned in the response, I still believe that there is no need to make such assumptions on the fixed variance across the arms. The notation $\sigma _ k ^ 2$ means the variance in round $k$, which can change when the selected arms are different (otherwise, the conditional expectation on $\mathcal F_k = \sigma(x_1,\epsilon_1,\ldots,x_{k-1},\epsilon_{k-1}, x_k)$ is meaningless.) I agree that assuming the fixed variance across the arms is a common practice. But for completeness, I suggest the authors mention the possibility of dealing with more general cases. I greatly appreciate the effort the authors made.  However, after careful consideration, I remain unconvinced about the paper's novelty, leading me to keep my scores.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to deal with distributions other than the Gaussian-Gamma prior distribution?
