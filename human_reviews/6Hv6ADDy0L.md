# Physics-aware Hand Object Interaction Denoising

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
The credibility and practicality of a reconstructed hand-object interaction sequence depend largely on its physical plausibility. However, due to high occlusions during hand-object interaction, physical plausibility remains a challenging criterion for purely vision-based tracking methods. To address this issue and enhance the results of existing hand trackers, this paper proposes a novel physically-aware hand motion de-noising method. Specifically, we introduce two learned loss terms that explicitly capture two crucial aspects of physical plausibility: grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility. These terms are used to train a physically-aware de-noising network. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both fine-grained physical plausibility and overall pose accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art de-noising methods.

### Summary
This paper proposes a physically-aware hand motion de-noising method to address the challenge of physical plausibility in hand-object interaction tracking. The method introduces two loss terms that capture grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility, which are used to train a physically-aware de-noising network. Experiments show that this approach outperforming other de-noising methods.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a dual hand-object interaction (HOI) representation for training a model that improves the physical plausibility of refined hand poses. The proposed representation combines holistic hand pose information and fine-grained hand-object relation, bridging explicit hand mesh vertices and physics-related knowledge learned by neural loss terms.

### Weaknesses
* The presence of numerous empirical settings in the two losses is observed, accompanied by a noticeable absence of a well-defined physical basis.

* It should be noted that certain significant references are missing, such as the reference for the HO-3D dataset. Red color and blue color are not defined in the caption or in the main text. 

* The degree of novelty exhibited by this paper appears to be limited. The sole introduction of two loss terms, resulting in marginal improvements in MPJPE, constitutes the primary contribution of this work. Penetration depth metric is also used in previous papers.

### Questions
* How to balance the data prior and physical constraint in the two-stage training process?

### Summary
Given a sequence of noisy hand poses, this paper aims to recover a noise-free and physically plausible hand motion. To this end, the authors propose a two stage pipeline with the first stage is a denoising auto-encoder trained with GT hand pose similar to that from TOCH (Zhou et al. (2022)). The second stage aims to refine the results with two novel physics-aware loss: grasp credibility loss and manipulation feasibility loss. The former aims to sloves the hand object penetration problem. And the latter measures ''whether the given hand-object contact can feasibly move the object along its trajectory''. The paper provides experimental results on synthetic dataset created by adding Gaussian noise to GT hand pose and test the generalization on one real dataset.

### Strengths
The motivation of leveraging the force analysis to account for the physically feasibility of the HOI is very interesting. The proposed two losses are also novel.

### Weaknesses
- The writing of the paper is not very clear.
   - Section 3.1 second paragraph, the first sentence is not a valid sentence.
   - Section 3, the first paragraph, about the notation in $\tilde{H}=(\tilde{H}^{i})_{1\leq i \leq T}$, There are two issues here. Firstly, maybe I am wrong, but I do not think such definition of using brackets $( )$ are mathematically meaningful. Is it to define a set, if so it should use { }.  Secondly, ${1\leq i \leq T}$ defines a continuous variable from 1 to T not a discrete one.
  - Section 3.2, page 5 second paragraph, according to the context, a physics-aware neural network is trained to mimic the penetration depth metric (PD). After it is trained, how is it used? I believe it has been used to train the second stage, right? The same for section 3.3.
  - It seems all the inline references used in the paper are not in parenthesis. I believe the authors miss used \citet when there should be \citep.

- I am not convinced by the setup of the task. From my understanding, it only refines the hand pose regardless of the object pose. However, the object poses produced by the RGB based methods such as the one used in this paper (Hasson et al. (2020)), are also very noisy. The two proposed losses highly rely on the object poses. Will the noisy object pose affects the final results?
    - Given a noisy hand motion, should the denoising process be deterministic especially when the noise level is high?

- In tuitively, it is hard to understand the proposed losses especially for the manipulation expense metric (page 6).

- As to the experiments, it would be better to also evaluate on other real-world datasets like DexYCB with more recent hand-object pose estimation pipelines to predict the inital hand-object poses.

### Summary
Authors proposed the physically-aware hand-object interaction de-noising framework combining data and physics priors. To support the framework, differentiable neural physical losses are provided to model both grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility. Also, the proposed method generalizes well to novel objects, motions, and noise patterns. In experiments, GRAB and HO-3D datasets are used to prove the superior performance.

### Strengths
It seems interesting to develop the denoising framework considering the physically-aware hand object interaction
New loss functions based on grasp credibility and manipulation feasibility were proposed.

### Weaknesses
The quality of Figure 2 could be improved. For example, it is nor clear what the frame in Fig 2 means (between training epoch or video’s frame). Also, it is unclear the right side of Fig. 2 is denoting the frames in videos or changes obtained during the optimization process.
Not clear which dataset was used in Table 3.
Technical novelty looks rather weak. Only few loss functions are proposed.
The accuracy gap to TOCH looks rather impressive; while the results presented in the ablation study is confusing. While the loss is the main contribution of the paper; the results obtained are not supporting the importance of them.
Should additionally show the ablation study on the HO-3D

### Questions
How d and p are defined when m is equal to 0? (In the case when there is no hand point corresponding to the object points).
In Table 3 and Table 4(b), when using losses, the accuracy seems gradually reduced. What is the reason for this?
What is the exact structure of the mapping network?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to denoise hand-object interaction sequences in a physically plausible manner. The proposed method follows a denoising autoencoder approach and employs two physically-aware loss terms to enforce physical plausibility while minimally perturbing the input poses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in two different hand-object interaction datasets, including a cross-dataset experiment that exhibits good generalization.

### Strengths
This is a solid work that tackles a challenging problem. Clearly a lot of work has been invested towards achieving the presented results. The problem is inherently hard given its discrete nature. This is mentioned in the introduction in the sentence reading "due to the intricate and
non-differentiable process of verifying the plausibility of hand motions". Taking this argument one step further, one can argue that it's the discrete nature of the hand-object interaction (contact vs non-contact) that imposes the difficulty on the verification process. This is also the reason others have relaxed the problem by considering small proximity fields near the contacts and similar relaxation strategies.

Further strong points include the generalization obtained across datasets and the wide applicability of the tackled problem.

### Weaknesses
Despite being rather well written overall, there are some points that in my opinion are hard to follow, and would benefit from a restructuring/rewriting. Specifically, in my opinion the whole paragraph describing the intermediate representation should be restructured for readability, in its current state it is hard to follow. I realize that this mostly describes the implicit field representation by Zhou et al, but it would still be beneficial for this work to adequately describe it since it forms a core part of the employed representation. Furthermore, but not as importantly, you may also want to consider reordering the subsection order in the methodology Section. This will allow to first present the two proposed losses, and then use them to describe the training process, this might aid the overall readability of the section.

Consider stating fairly early in the paper (even perhaps in the abstract) that a *rigid* object is assumed -- this is of course fine, the problem is already hard enough even before considering deformable objects. Nevertheless I believe it would be beneficial for the interested reader that this assumption is explicitly stated early on.

Another criticism point arises from multiple empirical values used throughout the work, such as the object mass (although I realize this is essentially up to a scale), the friction coefficient, and several thresholds representing physical distances such as the contact threshold. Although the values seem reasonable, it might make sense to meta-optimize them or otherwise justify them in a more consistent manner.

To the best of my understanding, the intermediate mapping layer \phi is not explicitly described, apart from describing it as a "projection layer". Is this a single linear layer? Is a non-linearity used? Perhaps an MLP of short depth? Please clarify

Regarding the penetration depth metric, the paragraph defining it concludes "Compared with previous works .... , our metric better reflects deep penetration cases". Intuitively, how is this achieved? Are there any experiments to back this claim?

Another point that requires some attention is the perturbation strategy of the MANO parameters in the end of Section 3.2. This may need some attention, depending on what parameters are perturbed. MANO consists of pose and shape parameters, which may be further processed using PCA to reduce their total number. Where exactly are you applying the perturbation? How did you determine the (maximum) noise variance?

Finally, the tackled problem has a long history and is still very actively researched. Space permitting, consider also citing the following related works:
