## Abstract
We present a diffusion-based image morphing approach with perceptually-uniform sampling (IMPUS) that produces smooth, direct and realistic interpolations given an image pair. The embeddings of two images may lie on distinct conditioned distributions of a latent diffusion model, especially when they have significant semantic difference. To bridge this gap, we interpolate in the locally linear and continuous text embedding space and Gaussian latent space. We first optimize the endpoint text embeddings and then map the images to the latent space using a probability flow ODE. Unlike existing work that takes an indirect morphing path, we show that the model adaptation yields a direct path and suppresses ghosting artifacts in the interpolated images. To achieve this, we propose a heuristic bottleneck constraint based on a novel relative perceptual path diversity score that automatically controls the bottleneck size and balances the diversity along the path with its directness. We also propose a perceptually-uniform sampling technique that enables visually smooth changes between the interpolated images. Extensive experiments validate that our IMPUS can achieve smooth, direct, and realistic image morphing and is adaptable to several other generative tasks.

### Summary
This paper presents a diffusion-based image morphing approach aiming to produce smooth, direct, and realistic interpolations given an image pair.  The authors interpolate in the locally linear and continuous text embedding space and Gaussian latent space. An "adaptive" bottleneck constraint based on a relative perceptual path diversity score that automatically controls the bottleneck size and balances the diversity along the path with its directness. Experiments verify the effectiveness to some extent. Though the method is clearly described, there exist some issues with both motivations and experiments.

### Strengths
* Image morphing in computer graphics is useful. Image morphing of nature images seems visually interesting to me.
* The method of image morphing with perceptually-uniform sampling using diffusion models is clearly described.
* The paper is OK to read.

### Weaknesses
* The motivation for image morphing of conceptually different nature images is not clear to me. Why should we study the image morphing of natural images without any human involvement? To my understanding, it may be reasonable to morph images for a certain purpose, e.g., continuously changing the poses or colors, via human involvement. However, how can we guarantee the generated images fit our purpose without any human involvement?
* The perceptually-uniform sampling is not reasonable to me. If I am right, morphing should be that given a uniform sequence in time-space, e.g., [0,1], and generating images "uniformly" changing between start and end images. In perceptually-uniform sampling, can we obtain the images corresponding to a given middle time?
* The authors argue "adaptive" bottleneck constraint. However, I can not see how the rank is adaptively learned.
* More discussion on the perceptual path diversity is encouraged. For example, why should we use this to measure the diversity? Why use the formulation in Eq. (8)? Does large $\gamma$ imply higher diversity?
* It would be better to provide an algorithm for both fine-tuning and inference.
* To show the superiority of the proposed method, more baseline approaches should be compared in experiments, such as the image morphing approaches in the related works.

### Questions
* In Eq. (5), $\nu$ is a distribution, why it should belong to the data manifold $\mathcal{M}$ which should be the set of samples?
* The embedding space of CLIP is locally linear. Since the two semantically distinct text embeddings are not in the global linear space, does it contradict the linear interpolation between the optimized embedding spaces?
* What is the logic for "the diffusion process between $\bf x_0$ and ${\bf x}_T$ can be seen as an optimal transport mapping, therefore, we apply spherical linear interpolation"?

### Summary
This paper presents an image morphing approach using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. The key idea is to interpolate text embeddings and latent states of two images following low-rank adaptation of model weights. The intuition is that the fine-tuned model exposes a more direct morphing path, yielding more perceptually convincing interpolations. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are performed to assess several key aspects of the proposed method. Overall, the method achieves superior morphing results compared to baselines and further supports interesting applications.

### Strengths
- The method makes use of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for image morphing. The data prior captured by the diffusion model naturally constrains the morphing path on the image manifold, allowing perceptually convincing interpolations.

- The paper provides a helpful discussion on the tradeoffs in model adaptation. It discovers that LoRA creates an effective bottleneck to reduce overfitting, and further devises a simple strategy to calculate LoRA ranks based on sample diversity along the morphing path.

- The paper introduces an effective approach for perceptually uniform sampling. It is based on adaptive step size selection and yields smooth and visually pleasing morphing results. 

- Several metrics are defined to evaluate different aspects of image morphing, namely smoothness, realism and directness. The method outperforms baselines in qualitative and quantitative experiments, and shows potential for several interesting applications.

### Weaknesses
- Despite the impressive results, there are some vague claims between the lines which need further clarification.

a) Equation 5 formulates image morphing as walking on the geodesic path in the 2-Wasserstein sense. However, the actual implementation amounts to linear interpolation of CLIP text embeddings, which in no way reflects the theoretical formulation.

b) For the interpolation of latent states, the paper cites an early work saying x0 and xT forms an optimal transport mapping. How does this justify the slerp interpolation between xT(0) and xT(1)?

- The method only compares to Wang and Golland (2023), another diffusion-based method for image morphing, yet there are numerous methods that are not based on diffusion (or even not learning-based). I am curious about how the method compares to, for example, frequency domain morphing methods, and what are their typical failure modes.

### Questions
- It would be helpful if the authors can comment on the robustness of their method relative to the hyper-parameters in model adaptation and sampling.

- Most of the image pairs used for experiments seem to have certain degree of spatial alignment. It would be helpful to know the rule of thumb for the selection of these image pairs.

### Summary
This paper proposes IMPUS, a diffusion-based image morphing method that can synthesize smooth and realistic transitions between two images. It employs a latent diffusion model with distinct conditional distributions for each image and interpolates in the locally linear and continuous text embedding space and Gaussian latent space. The method employs an adaptive bottleneck constraint based on a novel relative perceptual path diversity score to yield a direct path and suppresses ghosting artifacts in the interpolated images. Extensive experiments confirm IMPUS's effectiveness in image morphing and its potential for other image generation tasks.

### Strengths
The idea of applying diffusion models on image morphing task is interesting and promising;
The proposed evaluation criterion Smoothness,  Realism and Directness are reasonable and effective;
The presented techniques are effective and the overall method is able to generate high qulity results;
Ablation studies are thorough and abundant, which fully reveals the function and influence of each components of the model

### Weaknesses
In the comparison section, the proposed method is only compared with one previous method, which seems to be not comprehensive.  Also, there's only qualitative comparison, while quantitative criterion and user study would better convey the difference.
In the realism criteria and section3, the authors discussed about manifold and distribution several times, but gave no illustration or discussion in the experiment section.

### Questions
Why is data manifold and data distribution discuessed in methodologies but not covered in experiments? Would it be possible to visualize the data manifold or distribution with figures or give quantitative experiment resutls?
Why is the proposed method compared with only one existing diffusion based image interpolation method? Are there other similar works, can they be compared in fair experiment settings and criteria?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method to generate smooth and realistic image morphing results using diffusion models. The method starts with a baseline approach based on textural embedding interpolation and latent interpolation. To advocate direct and plausible interpolation results, authors fine-tune the diffusion model based on the image pairs with a bottleneck constraint implemented by LoRA to retrain the mode coverage along the morphing path. The rank is selected adaptively based on a metric that measures the density along the morphing path. To produce a smooth morphing, interpolation parameters are adaptively determined to ensure uniform perceptual transition. The proposed method demonstrates improved image morphing results compared to the prior work, especially when the semantics of the image pairs differ a lot.

### Strengths
- The method proposes several effective techniques to improve the prior diffusion-based baseline, yielding smooth, realistic and direct morphing results. The method works well on challenging cases as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the main text and Figure 2 in the Appendix, which are indeed impressive. Notably, these are achieved without auxiliary knowledge such as pose guidance as used in prior the method.

- The proposed techniques are simple yet effective. The LoRA finetuning effectively improves the plausibility of the interpolation results without mode collapse to training data. The perceptually uniform sampling based on the LPIPS difference is a quite useful technique and will benefit the following works in this area.

- The paper proposes novel metrics to measure the morphing quality in terms of directness, realism and smoothness. The quantitative comparisons are solid and sufficiently prove the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
- While the proposed method is effective, I think the contribution of the paper is relatively incremental. The framework is mostly built upon Wang and Golland 2023. Using LoRA to derive an input-aware diffusion model is relatively straightforward. And the proposed metrics are mostly based on prior work. Also, the LoRA rank adaption is heuristic and cannot be regarded as a major contribution.

- The physical meaning of the relative perceptual path diversity (rPPD) score is not clear. Why the score is a ratio that divides the
perceptual difference of the endpoint images? Moreover, the accumulated LPIPS difference cannot properly reflect the semantic difference of the input image pair. For example, the morphing for two bears that change a lot in location may be much easier than the morphing for two objects that differ significantly in semantics. To properly choose the LoRA rank, a much simpler metric that depends on CLIP score difference seems to suffice.

- Some of the proposed techniques only bring marginal improvement. As shown in Table 2, the best model is more likely not to be the one with adaptive rank. And in Figure 4, the difference between (n) and (o) is not significant.

- There is no quantitative study for the effectiveness of separate LoRA for unconditional score estimation. Also, there is no smoothness measure for perceptually uniform sampling.

### Questions
The rank adaption based on relative perceptual path diversity (rPPD) seems not effective enough. Is it possible to use much simpler heuristics based on CLIP score difference?

The techniques proposed in the paper do not make a significant difference when used independently, but the visual difference relative to the prior work (Figure 2) is impressive. It will be useful to show the qualitative results that show how the result progressively evolves by adding each technique one by one. Such analysis will let the readers understand which component plays the role at most.
