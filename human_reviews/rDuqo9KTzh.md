# Meta-Knowledge Extraction: Uncertainty-Aware Prompted Meta-Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Conventional meta-learning typically involves adapting all meta-knowledge to specific tasks, which incurs high computational costs due to the adaption process. To address this limitation, we introduce a more efficient gradient-based meta-learning framework called Uncertainty-Aware Prompted Meta-Learning (UAPML). Instead of adapting the entire meta-knowledge, we introduce a meta-knowledge extraction paradigm inspired by the success of large language models. In this paradigm, we freeze the model backbone and employ task-specific prompts to extract meta-knowledge for few-shot tasks. To construct the task-specific prompts, a learnable Bayesian meta-prompt is employed to provide an ideal initialization. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the posterior uncertainty of the Bayesian meta-prompt aligns with that of the task-specific prompt, which can be used to modulate the construction of task-specific prompts. Accordingly, we propose two ways, i.e., the soft and hard way, to automatically construct task-specific prompts from the meta-prompt when dealing with new tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the meta-knowledge extraction paradigm and highlight the significantly reduced computational cost achieved by our UAPML framework without the degradation of performance.

### Summary
A Bayesian prompt tuning approach is introduced to MAML for a few-shot image classification task. The main idea is to leverage prompt to fast adapt input to the fixed meta-leaner (feature extractor), instead of computing nested gradients on the whole model, in order to improve learning/inference efficiency. Experiments on four benchmark datasets were provided under two simple backbone models (4-conv layer network and ResNet12) compared with a series of strong baselines.

### Strengths
- It is interesting to introduce prompt tuning to the MAML framework. Leveraging prompts to adapt input space accounting for the shared meta feature extractor is also orthogonal to the previous MAML-based methods. 
- The proposed meta prompt is well-motivated and developed. While lacking strong empirical evidence (see weaknesses), the Bayesian treatment of prompt learning is provided and seems to work in practice. 
- The experiment is designed well with a series of relevant baseline methods, a detailed ablation study, and necessary model discussions.

### Weaknesses
- While the motivation for introducing the Bayesian meta-prompt is clear and reasonable, the current experimental results cannot fully support it due to the lack of a large meta-feature extractor network (backbone). The main goal of this work is to leverage prompt tuning to avoid inefficient nested gradient calculation on large models; yet the backbones used in the experiment are too small to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. *Table 2* also exacerbates the above concern, where all the methods actually report a comparable training/adaption time. 
- The prompt poster is inconsistent through Eqs (1), (4), and (6). It remains confusing 1) where the meta prompt is sampled from and 2) what parameters are used in optimizing the prompt posterior. Is $p(s)$ in (1) the prompt prior or the posterior, or should it be written as $p(s|D)$? In meta-training, should the method sample prompt from the prior or the learned posterior? Comparing (4) and (6), is $q(s)$ optimized through $\phi$ or $\theta$?
- It lacks strong empirical evidence to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian meta-prompt. From Table 3, the probabilistic formulation of the meta-prompt did not show a significant improvement. How about directly learning $s$ through a MAML approach? 
- The lit review is insufficient. Some relevant works, e.g., Probabilistic Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, should be clearly discussed in the paper.

### Questions
Please refer to the questions in the `Weaknesses`. Plus, the reviewer is curious about the following questions:
- Can the proposed method be applied to large models? Such as ResNet101, ViT-L/14, etc. 
- How does the proposed method choose the prompt prior? Is the proposed method sensitive to prior choice? 
- Can the paper show some visualizations of how the prompt uncertainty changes across different tasks?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel efficient gradient-based meta-learning framework that freezes the model backbone and only updates task-specific "prompts" to extract meta-knowledge for few-shot tasks. The task-specific "prompt" is constructed through the meta learning bi-level idea again based on a learnable Bayesian meta-"prompt". Experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is clear.
2. The presentation is good and not hard to follow.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical novelty might not be enough. Although the paper claims that the idea is inspired from prompt tuning of LLM, it is still to meta-learn part of model parameters (the majority of model parameters are freezed), so that the training becomes efficient. Similar papers are:
[1] Rapid learning or feature reuse? towards understanding the effectiveness of maml, ICLR 2019
[2] Boil: Towards representation change for few-shot learning, ICLR 2020

2. minor issues: one ")" is missed in Eq.10.

### Questions
I am still not convinced by the connection between prompt tuning and the idea in the paper. The idea of this paper is more close and similar to ANIL and BOIL [1,2], and I did not find a similarity with prompt tuning, technically speaking. Since the authors use many spaces to explain prompt tuning, I assume I missed their connection. If the authors could explain this connection and key difference from ANIL and BOIL in the response, I am open to raising the rating.

### Summary
The manuscript proposes a meta-learning method that is based on meta-knowledge extraction, where prompt learning is used to link the general knowledge and task-specific knowledge.  The task-specific prompts are used to extract meta-knowledge for few-shot tasks, and a Bayesian meta-prompt provides a better initialization for them (like the task-specific parameter and the initialization of the model parameter in model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)). The manuscript proposes two gradient-based update rules to update the task-specific prompts from the meta-prompts using the uncertainty captured by the standard deviations of the posteriors of the meta-prompts (hence why the proposed method is called uncertainty-aware prompted meta-learning). The proposed methods are compared with multiple meta-learning methods on several few-shot learning datasets.

### Strengths
Overall, the manuscript is well written and explains the motivation for using of the prompt learning with sufficient background.  

As a prompt learning method (the knowledge extraction), the proposed methods may provide a way to improve the computation load that meta-knowledge adaptation methods would have.

### Weaknesses
The main proposed methods (for constructing the task-specific prompts from the meta-prompt) look ad hoc, although the authors claim to provide the theoretical analysis supporting the methods. I understood that the proposed two gradient-based update rules (in eq. (11)) are not designed to directly optimize the something derived from a full Bayesian model including the meta-prompts and task-specific prompts (like eq. (6)). The fact that the two update rules takes different inputs from the posteriors of the meta-prompts (the hard modulation takes the means and the standard deviations, but the soft modulation takes only the standard deviations) makes both update rules look more ad hoc. 

I think the manuscript could be improved in presentation. There are missing details and typos in the main text. For example:
1)  The exact definition of the Gaussian distributions for the meta-prompts is not given in the main text. (as well as the definition of the standard deviation of d-th dimension of the meta-prompt, \sigma_d). I could find some descriptions in the appendix, but I think these descriptions should be included in the main text for easier reading. 
2) In Section 5.2 (RQ2), the figure and table are referenced incorrectly (Figure 1 and Table 1?); what is the exact definition of the (weighted) KL-term considered in this section? Could it be eq. (4)? What is the exact meaning of the removal of the Bayesian treatment?        

Minor comments:
Figure 1 is not directly mentioned in the main text? 
The symbol \mathcal{L} was introduced as a loss function but also was used as the lower bound (which should be maximized) in eq. (6). Please also check eq. 5 (the relationship between the loss function and the likelihood).

### Questions
The manuscript states that one of the main motivations (of using the prompt learning) is to improve the computational inefficiency of the meta-knowledge adaptation. However, in the experimental result section, the improvements in the computation time do not look significant compared to the baseline (e.g., MAML) for the choice of the backbone network (e.g., Conv4). This could lead to the misunderstanding that the improvements reported in the experimental results are a matter of implementation (e.g., code optimization). The datasets may not be large enough to contrast the improvements in the computation time of the methods? 

In Section 5.2 (RQ2), what did you intend to show the performance changes in the dimension of the meta prompts? It does not clear from the text. How can we understand this pattern in terms of Bayesian learning? In the current version of the manuscript, the figures just say that the dimension of the meta prompts is also the hyperparameter to be tuned by the users.
