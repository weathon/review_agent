## Abstract
We rigorously study the joint evolution of training dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the spectra of empirical Hessian and gradient matrices. We prove that in two canonical classification tasks for multi-class high-dimensional mixtures and either 1 or 2-layer neural networks, the SGD trajectory rapidly aligns with emerging low-rank outlier eigenspaces of the Hessian and gradient matrices. Moreover, in multi-layer settings this alignment occurs per layer, with the final layer's outlier eigenspace evolving over the course of training, and exhibiting rank deficiency when the SGD converges to sub-optimal classifiers. This establishes  some of the rich predictions that have arisen from extensive numerical studies in the last decade about the spectra of Hessian and information matrices over the course of training in overparametrized networks.

### Summary
Background: Empirical findings in [1] show that the iterates of SGD, used for training deep learning models for classification, converges to a neighborhood of a tiny subspace of the parameter space - in particular to the eigenspace of the top eigenvalues of the Hessian and the covariance matrix of gradients - which justifies why deep learning algorithms does not suffer the curse of dimensionality.

Summary: This manuscript rigorously proves that this observation should hold in multi-class logistic regression and 2-layer neural networks trained on Gaussian mixture models. Moreover, they also show that this alignment between the SGD iterates and the top eigenspace of the Hessian holds layer-wise and does not depend on the model's success.

### Strengths
* It provides theoretical evidence for an important observation. 

* Although the previous studies considered the single and/or multi-index models [1,2] suggest that such alignments are expected, this work goes beyond them and proves more, such as the layer-wise alignment, and that alignment occurs even if the model fails to learn the ground truth.

* Overall, it is a very good work! (However, there are some minor mistakes in the proof. Please see the Questions section)

### Questions
* I checked the proofs corresponding to Theorems 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 carefully.  There are some minor mistakes (which should be fixable):
   - In Eq. (C.10), the second term in the RHS should not be correct.
   - In Eq. (C.8), you missed the case b \neq a = c.
   - In the fifth equation on Page 26 in Appendix, (the one starts with \langle \nabla_c H, \nable_a R_aa^{\perp} \rangle), I think you missed a term in the RHS.
   - In the equation above (C.14) (the one starts with \nabla_c H \otimes  \nabla_d H), I think many terms are missing in the RHS. Please check that part carefully.
   - Because of the previous point, Eq. (C.14) should be incorrect, which eventually makes the correctness of the correction terms in Theorem 5.7 questionable. Can you check this part again as well?

* I skimmed through the rest of the proofs. I could not see a major mistake.

* As the last question for the authors: Your results crucially depend on the high-dimensional limit for SGD proven in [1]. In that work, it was shown that there is a critical learning rate that causes additional correction terms in the limit. Can you comment on how the existence of the correction terms affects your results?

### Summary
This paper looks at the task of classification for high-dimensional gaussian mixtures using 1 or 2-layer neural networks. The authors show that the SGD trajectories rapidly aligns with the low-rank outlier eigenspaces of the Hessian and gradient matrices.

### Strengths
There has been many previous papers that study the empirical Hessian during the training process of SGD. It has been observed that the hessian spectrum can often be separated into a bulk component depending on the network architecture, and outlier eigenvalues which depend on the data. For a simple Gaussian mixture model, this paper gives a rigorous proof of this phenomenon for SGD.

Overall I think this is a strong theoretical result that characterizes the implicit bias of SGD and explains some of the previous empirical observations about the empirical Hessian.

### Weaknesses
Overall I found this to be a very solid work. I did not find any major weaknesses.

### Summary
This manuscript investigates the alignement of one-pass SGD trajectory with the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian in the high-dimensional limit. In particular, it shows that for two different tasks:
 1. multi-class logistic regression on a k-Gaussian mixture model;
 2. classifying a XOR Gaussian mixture with a two-layer neural network   

for sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, the SGD trajectory of the model parameters approximately lies in the span of the top eigenvectors of the test Hessian after a number of steps which is linear in the input data dimension.

### Strengths
Characterising the geometry of SGD, and in particular finding the relevant subspaces where the low-dimensional subspaces where the high-dimensional trajectory lies is an important problem. In many theoretical setups, the relevant subspaces can be guessed from symmetries of the problem, and can be used to derive low-dimensional scaling limits for the projection of the trajectory in these subspaces - an approach that has been employed in many works old and recent works in the literature, c.f. [Saad & Solla 1995a,b; Goldt et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2019; Refinetti et al. 2021; Veiga et al 2022; Ben Arous et al. 2022; Paquette et al. 2022; Arnaboldi et al 2023; Shuo & Vershynin 2023]. However, an important limitation of this approach is that it is hard to generalise to more general setups where the relevant statistics are less clear to guess. This work proposes a roadmap to overcome this limitation, consisting of taking the spam of the top outlier directions in the Hessian/G-matrix, and shows this correlates with the standard summary statistics for these examples. If this proves more general, it could open up an important new theoretical tool in the study of SGD.

### Weaknesses
The main limitation is that the two classification tasks have a particular structure. Indeed, in both the linear case and the two-layer case considered here, the Hessian/G-matrix of the first layer weights is proportional to $Y\otimes Y$. For a Gaussian mixture $Y = y\mu + Z_{\lambda}$, indeed the relevant subspace spanned by the means will naturally pop as an outlier of this matrix when the SNR $\lambda$ is large enough: this is the classical BBP transition. Therefore, it is not surprising this also happens at the level of the Hessian/G-matrix. Maybe proving this requires a tour de force, but it is fair to doubt on the generality of the conclusion. For instance, it would be desirable to show a similar result for tasks where the structure is on the labels, and not on the inputs, e.g. teacher-student models.

### Questions
- **[Q1]**: In Thm 3.1, how does the critical variance $\lambda_{0}$ for SGD alignement compares with the BBP threshold for the recovery of the means $\mu_{a}$ from $Y = y\mu + Z_{\lambda}$?

- **[Q2]**: In both examples considered here, the timescale for the trajectory to correlate with the outlier subspace is linear in the dimension. How general should we expect this to be? For instance, would be authors expect this to hold in problems where escaping a fixed point would take longer than linear time in the dimension?

- **[Q3]**: On the same spirit of the question above, would the authors expect the theorem to remain true at longer timescales? In general, should we expect these subspaces to be stable or the SGD trajectories to eventually escape these subspaces?

- **[Q4]**: From the statement of the results, it seems they hold for both the G-matrix and the Hessian. Is there any reason for looking at the Hessian instead of the computationally simpler G-matrix? Are the subspaces spanned by the top eigenvectors of both matrices equivalent, e.g. in the sense of Def. 2.2?

- **[Q5]**: Are the authors aware of converse examples to their result. For instance, a problem where the underlying target function does depend only on a few relevant directions, but that the outliers in the Hessian/G-matrix are not necessarily aligned with it?  

**Minor comments**

- The reference in the top of Page 2:
> "*Liao & Mahoney (2021) studied Hessians of some non-linear models beyond generalized linear models, also at initialization.*"

is misleading. The main result in Liao & Mahoney (2021) concerns the Hessian of a loss function of the type (see eq. 3):
$$L(w)=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\ell(y_{i}, w^{\top}x_{i})$$ under the assumption $y_{i}\sim f(y|w_{\star}^{\top}x_{i})$ (see eq. 1). Despite their unusual choice of terminology for this model ("G-GLM"), this is mostly commonly known as a generalized linear model in the literature... when just not simply refereed to as "linear model".

- The following references:
> *ODE limits of the SGD training with single layer networks have been derived and numerically solved in Mignacco et al. (2020); Loureiro et al. (2021).*

are not accurate. Indeed, Mignacco et al. (2020) and Loureiro et al. (2021) study the classification of Gaussian mixtures with a single layer networks. However, they derive exact expressions for the training and test errors of the minimiser of the empirical risk. Indeed, this should correspond to the asymptotic performance of one-pass SGD when $t\to\infty$ of the example considered in Section 3.

- The figures in the manuscript are not very readable. First, even if this is described in the caption, it would be good to label the (x,y)-axis for clarity. Second, they are small, and since the format is not vectorial they get pixelated when zoomed over. Third, what does the colour scheme means? Maybe add a colour bar?

- I understand the authors might not want to dwell 30 years of literature on SGD scaling limits. But I would encourage them to mention at least some of the recents works on this line which are contemporary to [Ben Arous et al. 2022] to represent the diversity of this literature, see e.g. the list below.

### Summary
The paper investigates the interplay between the training dynamics of one-pass SGD and the spectral decompositions of the Hessian matrix and G-matrix. The authors study this interaction on two high-dimensional classification tasks with cross-entropy loss. 

The authors start with the classification of k-component Gaussian mixture models by a single-layer network. The outlier-minibulk-bulk structure is shown by deriving limiting dynamical equations for the trajectory of summary statistics of the SGD trajectory. The authors also study a specific case where means are orthogonal and show the one-pass SGD aligns with the largest outlier eigenvalue.

The authors further study the classification of the XOR problem on the Gaussian mixture model via a two-layer network. It is shown that the alignment between SGD and outlier eigenspaces is present in each layer. The results match the spectral phase transition in spiked covariance matrices.

### Strengths
- Provide theoretical understandings of the interaction between training dynamics of one-pass SGD and the outlier-bulk structure of Hessian matrix and G-matrix.
- Detailed explanations help understand the theory and make the manuscript easy to follow.
- Numerical experiments verify the theorems.

### Weaknesses
- Comparison and contribution over the prior works are not very clear.
- Some technical part is hard to parse, it might be helpful to introduce the intuition for the main proof steps.

### Questions
I would like to ask the following questions to the authors:

- Is it possible to extend the theory based on cross-entropy loss to general function class?
- The authors mention that SGD finds the subspace generated by the outlier eigenvalues for any uninformative initializations with norm $O(1)$ in Section 3.2, does the similar property hold for XOR-type mixture models via two-layer networks?

### Summary
This paper studies high-dimensional SGD by examining the alignment between the SGD iterates with the emerging outlier eigenspaces of the Hesian and gradient matrices. It is shown that after a short period of training, the SGD iterates start to align with the low-rank outlier eigenspace with the empirical Hessian and empirical G-matrices, and that the alignment may happen layer-wise for multi-layer architectures. The main results are proved for two settings: 1) learning a Gaussian mixture model with linearly independent classes by a single layer neural network, and 2) learning a Gaussian mixture model version of the XOR problem. Numerical evidence is also provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

### Strengths
This paper is well written and easy to follow. The results are novel and solid, and the presentation of the technical results are very clear with  the numerical illustrations of the theoretical predictions.

### Weaknesses
- The results are proved for two somewhat restricted settings, and it seems not clear how to extend the argument to more general settings. It would be helpful if the authors can comment on the limitations of the current proof.

- It seems that the main technical tool is from Ben Arous et al. (2022). It would be helpful to add some discussion on the technical novelty.

- The results are valid for online SGD. It is worth a comment whether this is necessary, as well as what happens for multi-pass SGD.

- A small typo: In the sentence above Theorem 4.1, "principal direcitons" -> "principal directions"

### Questions
- The learning rate $\delta = O(1/d)$ seems to be on a very small scale, especially for large $d$. Could the authors comment on this requirement for the learning rate?

- The main theorems state that the alignment happens for $\ell \in [T_0\delta^{-1}, T_f \delta^{-1}]$. What's the corresponding generalization performance of the model on the test data?

### Summary
This paper studies SGD applied to two problems, namely multi-class logistic regression and XOR classification with a two-layer network. It is shown that in both scenarios, the training trajectories of SGD aligns with both the hessian and the Fisher information during training. Moreover, for the XOR problem, the alignment occurs in both layers of the network.

### Strengths
- The results of alignment are technically strong.
- The reasoning is solid and convincing.

### Weaknesses
1. The major weakness of this work is that the motivation of studying the evolution of the Hessian/Fisher information is not super clear. According to the introduction and the related works, from my perspective, the best thing we know about the relationship between the Hessian and the effectiveness of SGD is that "this common low-dimensional structure to the SGD and Hessian matrix may be key to many classification tasks in machine learning" (Gur-Ari et al., 2019). From my point of view, there is no solid evidence indicating that the main results of this work imply an advantage or a disadvantage of SGD. I will consider raising my score if this question is properly settled.
2. Figure 3.3  and Figure 4.3 are a bit confusing without legends.
3. In the paragraph following Theorem 4.2, the terms "GOE" and "Wishart matrix" may appear unfamiliar to many.
4. In the notation of covariance matrix $I_d/\lambda$, the $\lambda$, which is typically a weight decay parameter, is used as the inverse of variance, causing some confusions to me.

### Questions
- I'm trying to understand Theorem 3.1. Intuitively, as $\varepsilon$ approaches 0, $T_0$ should grow larger. Is it possible that $T_0$ becomes so large that the theorem becomes vacuous, i.e., $T_0>M/d$?
- Is there a counterpart of Theorem 3.3 for the XOR setting?
- Is there any specific reason why the authors study the Hessian and Fisher information that is obtained from the **test data** instead of from the **expectation w.r.t. the data distribution**?
