# Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Active Exploration

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in reinforcement learning where direct evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. A notable recent example arises in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on large language models. For many applications of RLHF, the cost of acquiring the human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback in order to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize this as an *offline contextual dueling bandit* problem. We give an upper-confidence-bound style algorithm for this problem and prove a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We then provide empirical confirmation in a synthetic setting that our approach outperforms existing methods. After, we extend the setting and methodology for practical use in RLHF training of large language models. Here, our method is able to reach better performance with fewer samples of human preferences than multiple baselines on three real-world datasets.

### Summary
This paper studies active learning in comparison-based contextual bandit. The authors propose a new approach for choosing contexts and actions effectively in order to learn a policy that has low suboptimality in the worst context. A theoretical guarantee on the suboptimality of the basic version of the algorithm (AE-Borda) is provided under RKHS. Extensive empirical results are provided for a DPO version of the algorithm (AE-DPO), including some experiments on Llama-7B.

### Strengths
The paper contains a theoretical result as well as extensive empirical results. The theoretical section offers a new perspective about RLHF with the Borda function. The plots are nicely made.

### Weaknesses
It would be nice if there is more discussion about why the proposed algorithm has better performance than existing algorithms (e.g., provide some intuition).

In Section 5.1, AE-DPO is compared with US-DPO, DPO, SFT. Among these baselines, DPO and SFT are really offline methods with uniform samples and not active learning methods, so US-DPO is the only active learning method that can compete with AE-DPO. Comparison with only one other active learning method seems slightly insufficient. Is there any other active learning algorithms in the existing literature that can be compared to?

### Questions
- Algorithm 1 relies on $\Phi_t$. How do we compute this quantity that depends on $r_A$, which I don't think is accessible in this setting?

- Many existing comparison-based algorithms learn the reward function first and then use it to construct the policy. In contrast, Algorithm 1 chooses to learn the Borda function. What is the advantage of learning the Borda function over learning the reward function?

- Both the abstract and Section 3 say the problem is offline contextual bandit, but I don't think the learner can freely query contexts and actions in the offline setting. In fact, wouldn't the ability of freely querying contexts and actions make this problem too simple? In this setting, the problem is just learning a function with a dataset chosen by the learner; the only difficulty is the data is pairwise comparisons.

- In Section 5.1, the authors observed that on Jeopardy! dataset, the policy trained with AE-DPO is able to abstain when it is not expected to know the correct answer, in contrast to policies trained with other baseline methods. Should this reduction in hallucination be attributed to your algorithm or just the objective you are using (Equation (2)), which is also supposed to make the learned policy behave more prudently and abstain when it is likely to answer incorrectly?  

I'm open to raising my score after reading the clarification from the authors and their discussion with other reviewers during rebuttal.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes an adaptive exploration method for RLHF. The method is based on a UCB style approach which selects the context that maximizes the gap between optimistic and pessimistic estimations of the Borda function. The paper then performs LLM experiments to justify the advantage of the adaptive exploration method.

### Strengths
The paper has good writing and is easy to follow. The theoretical formulation is clean and the result is solid.

### Weaknesses
1. One weakness is the theoretical part is less related with the LLM experiments. The theory is associated with Borda function and RKHS, but in the LLM part both concepts are removed. And while AE-Borda is a value-based algorithm, the LLM part switches to a policy-based algorithm instead. The only shared idea is both algorithms select the context which maximizes some optimistic gap. But the link between theory and experiment is still weak. 

2. In Figure 4, the result of AE-DPO tends to have a higher variance compared with other baselines. This fact could make the paper's claim less convincing as it's possible that the plot happens to choose the good seeds, given that the result is so noisy.

### Questions
For the Jeopardy dataset, one may find that the null rate for incorrect answer starts to decrease when the number of samples further goes up, which means that large sample size is not always helpful. This is very different from the conclusion of the theory part. Any comments on this fact?

### Summary
This paper studied an interesting problem: how to actively collect data during reward model learning. The authors cast the problem into a contextual dueling bandit problem and proposed an algorithm with regret bound. Some experiments are conducted for the full LM case. 

Overall, I feel this work studied a timely topic but was not well executed. The current context may not be sufficient to be accepted at a top-tier ML conference. I evaluated this work from two aspects: theoretical contribution and empirical contribution.

For theoretical contribution, I feel it is rather limited. First, contextual dueling bandit has been studied for a while in the bandit community. If one only cares about worse-case simple regret bound, any algorithm that enjoys a cumulative regret guarantee can be turned into a simple regret minimization algorithm, for example, "Optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Preference Bandits". Second, Assumption 2 is quite strong. It is very hard to satisfy for large action space which is the case for LM. The theory largely benefits from this assumption. I do not believe any interesting LM application can satisfy this.

Second, the algorithm proposed in Section 5 is very different from the one in previous sections with guarantee and the algorithm is very heuristic. The authors seem to use ensemble dropout to estimate the standard deviation. This is very doubtful if dropout can estimate the variance well for an autoregressive transformer. As far as I know, there has been no study on that before. More importantly,  none of the win-rate is statistically significant, especially. for the Anthropic dataset. It is hard for me to trust any conclusion from such a noisy result. 

Minor: 1. Why the win-rate is far below 0.5 in Figures 9 and 10? I suppose the baseline is uniform sampling.
2. The term 'offline' contextual bandits is very misleading. I think you are doing online learning: actively collect human feedback. Offline problem usually refers to the case the dataset is given.
3. In Algorithm 1, the second action is drawn uniformly random. This is weird and why it could work? Will this benefit from Assumption 2 as well?
4. DPO also has experiments on the Anthropic dataset. You should at least report or discuss the win-rate matched in their setting to make sure if the implementation is correct. 
5. How do you generate multiple completions?

### Strengths
1.	The studied problem, i.e., offline contextual dueling bandit with human feedback, is well-motivated and models the RLHF training of large language models.
2.	The paper provides extensive experimental results in both synthetic and practical LLM settings.

### Weaknesses
1.	The techniques used in the proposed algorithms, e.g., the estimation of the Borda score by uniform sampling, active learning and confidence intervals, are well-known. The authors should elaborate more on the technical novelty.
2.	The procedures of Algorithms 1 and 2 are not clear. It would be better to specify the definitions of $\mu_t(x,a)$ and $\sigma_t(s,a)$ in the main text. The notation $\sigma_t(x,a)$ is overlapped with the notation of link function $\sigma$.
3.	Can the authors compare their algorithms with the MLE method for learning the reward model, and discuss the advantages of their algorithms?
4.	It seems that Algorithms 1 and 2 need to compute the argmax operation over the context space $\mathcal{X}$ and the action space $\mathcal{A}$. Can these algorithms be extended to the large context and action space setting? In LLMs, the spaces of contexts and actions are often large.

**---After Rebuttal---**

Thank the authors for their rebuttal. I read the authors' rebuttal and other reviewers' comments. 

In my opinion, while the authors consider a stronger (variant) notion of suboptimality, the theoretical part (Section 4) of this paper is not novel, since the ideas of estimating Borda score and selecting the option with the maximum uncertainty is well-known in the dueling bandit and active learning literatures. I think the more interesting contributions of this paper are the well-motivated problem formulation which is applicable to LLMs, and the experiments on LLMs with the proposed algorithm. However, to some degree I agree the comments of Reviewers 7uH1 and aHAt, i.e., the algorithm in Section 5 is heuristic and a little disconnected with the theoretical results in Section 4. The algorithm design and empirical results for LLMs (Section 5) seem to lack the theoretical supports.

I tend to keep my score 5, and will listen to the opinions of other reviewers and AC during the discussion period.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies RLHF in a setting where one is allowed to choose contexts in which feedback can be obtained. The authors develop an upper-confidence-bound style algorithm in this setting that enjoys a regret guarantee. They also show favorable empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets in aligning language models.

### Strengths
- The paper makes empirical improvements toward an important topic of increasing the efficiency of RLHF, which is relevant, particularly for LLMs.
- Empirical evaluations show improvements in efficiency compared to prior work.

### Weaknesses
- Novelty in problem selection (i.e., the setting where the contexts can be chosen instead) and the algorithm design are limited. 
- Theoretical contribution of the paper is limited to strong assumptions and the analysis techniques exist in prior works.
- The main algorithm requires uncertainty quantification for the policy, which is difficult for LLM policies. A method based on dropout is used for such uncertainty quantification; however, why this method is used over alternatives is not discussed.
