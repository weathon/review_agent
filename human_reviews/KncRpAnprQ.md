## Abstract
Deep learning has made tremendous progress in the last decades; however, it is not robust to adversarial attacks.  
To deal with this issue, perhaps the most effective approach is adversarial training at a high computational cost, although it is impractical as it needs prior knowledge about the attackers.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can train a robust network only through standard training
with clean images without awareness of the attacker's strategy. Essentially, we add a specially designed network input layer,
which accomplishes a randomized feature squeezing to greatly reduce the malicious perturbation. 
It achieves the state of the art of robustness against unseen ${l_1,l_2,\text{and }l_\infty}$-attacks at one time in terms of the computational cost of the attacker versus the defender through just 100/50 epochs of standard training with clean images in CIFAR-10/ImageNet.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a new plug-in module, which can help the model against adversarial attacks. After using such a model, only standard training can fulfill the robust requirement.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a random module to defend against various adversarial attacks.

2. The proposed module is lightweight without introducing too many parameters.

3. The authors consider different model structures cooperating with the proposed method.

4. There are EOT experiment results, which is important for a randomization-based defense.

### Weaknesses
1. Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) have been proposed for many years, which are not a novel approach to defend against adversarial attacks. Therefore, I think the authors overclaim their contribution.

2. The authors do not mention any related works under the topic of SNNs or other stochastic methods. I am not sure whether the authors are on purpose or not. But the Related Works should mainly discuss the most related papers.

3. The authors do not compare any SNN baselines, which causes unfairness in the experiments. For example, I can simply find a paper [1] from Google Scholar, which discusses SNN in adversarial defense. In experiments, they compared various stochastic methods, which I cannot find in this paper. This unfair comparison causes a false contribution.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of adversarial attacks on deep learning models. The authors propose an approach that enhances network robustness without knowledge of the attack strategy. They introduce an input layer that reduces the impact of malicious perturbations, achieving robustness against various attack types through standard training with clean images on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

### Strengths
- The authors focus on an important topic, namely adversarial training to robustify deep neural networks. 
- The idea of an approach that requires no prior knowledge of attacks is interesting. 
- The approach is straightforward. 
- The authors evaluate their approach on ImageNet.

### Weaknesses
- Trivial technical contribution: The manipulation of early or other intermediate features has been proposed various times in the literature. Most of these defenses have also been defeated. 
- The authors do not provide any ablation studies to justify their design choices. 
- The title is chosen too general and is vague. 
- The writing is poor: 
	- Some parts of the paper are incomprehensible. 
	- The introduction is written like a related work section
	- The contributions are not clearly explained and distinguished to previous works
	- A proper explanation of the proposed approach  
- I can't grasp what Figure 2 is supposed to show. 
- While the authors evaluated with AutoAttack I am wondering how this method performs against the PGD-attack. 
- The authors might encounter obfuscated gradients here. Hence the authors should follow the guidelines in [1] and [2] and evaluate with BPDA. 
- Did the authors try if their approach also works for vision transformer models?

### Summary
This paper proposes a input preprocessing method for defending against adversarial examples. The method works by _squeezing_ the input into the range $[0, 1]$ by first performing a simple (linear + thresholding) transformation followed by a random shift and a random scaling. Finally a sigmoid activation is used to squeeze the input to $[0, 1]$. With this simple preprocessing function, this paper reports stunning performances against strong adversarial attacks.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a preprocessor that obtains very strong performance on adversarial examples while not training on adversarial examples at all. This is a very surprising result if it is able to withstand thorough empirical evaluation.

### Weaknesses
1.	Gradient Masking and Suppression: The paper has many well-known signs of gradient masking, which is a phenomenon where estimating gradients of a classifier might be error-prone. In this paper, there are two components that might be causing this: (1) the random shift and scaling, (2) sigmoid squeezing. Further, Table 1 shows that the performance of the proposed method barely decreases under the strong auto attack ($\ell_infty, \ell_1$) as well as square attacks. This typically indicates some issues with the underlying evaluation [1].


2.	Evaluation on Black Box Attacks: Interestingly, the paper does provide an evaluation on the black box Square attack, which is considered to be a strong black box attack. However, the evaluation is subject to concern, as the performance barely dips below the benign performance after attack. A simple test to check any problems with the evaluation would be to intentionally inject adversarial examples and check if the performance is still retained [2].


3.	Code for the method and evaluations: Since the authors report stunning performance increases, in light of the above concerns, it would be easier to believe the claims if well documented code would be provided for each of the evaluations.


4.	Writing: The writing is loose and informal in some parts of the paper.
	1.	P3: Step 1: What is mean, std?
	2.	“$\delta$ is a uniform one” -> “$\delta \sim {\rm Unif}([0, 1])$", etc.
	3.	Sec 4.3: It seems that the adversarial examples are generated for one realization of the network, and tested on another. This is not standard practice. 
	4.	P5: EOT — it would be useful to mention the exact parameters over EOT is performed, and how those parameters were chosen. 
	5.	Figure 2: Please show the RGB in the first column, all rows — it is hard to understand what is going on by looking at R,G,B channels separately. Even then, what are we supposed to take away from this figure?

### Questions
In addition to the concerns raised above, 

1.	What is the robustness vs accuracy curve? When does it dip below the benign performance, for each of the attacks tested? At what perturbation does it go to zero? At this perturbation, how does a human perform?


2.	What is the role of each of the components of the preprocessor towards the final robustness, in that what happens when each of them are replaced by an identity transformation? (1) Sigmoid, (2) Random scaling, (3) Random Shift

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper introduces a specialized input layer to improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. Each pixel in the normalized images goes through a perturbation and multiplication process, and then are fed into a Sigmoid function before proceeding with the rest of the network. Evaluations on CIFAR10 and Imagenet-1k in the white-box setting demonstrate that the resulting networks are robust to various $\ell_p$ bounded perturbations generated using AutoAttack.

### Strengths
The proposed input layer design introduces virtually no computation overhead while improving the adversarial robustness of the network in the while-box setting, against gradient-based attacks. Empirical evaluations are performed on CIFAR10 as well as larger dataset such as Imagenet. Visualizations presented in Figure 2 are helpful in understanding the effect of the proposed input layer.

### Weaknesses
Figure 2 shows that the output of proposed input layers are mostly 0's and 1's, which are towards the saturation range in the sigmoid function. This means that the robustness improvement comes mostly from obfuscated gradients [1]. In other words, the network is having trouble finding effective adversarial perturbations, rather than being truly more adversarial robust compared to the baselines.

### Questions
A simple test to verify the obfuscating gradient behaviour is to measure whether the perturbation, found based on the attack methods in the paper, indeed reaches the specified radius of the $\ell_p$ ball.
