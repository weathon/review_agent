## Abstract
Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) play a vital role in using quantum resources for supervised machine learning tasks, such as classification. However, current methods are strongly limited in terms of scalability on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)  devices. In this work, we propose a novel approach called the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) enhanced QSVM. This is built upon our idea of utilizing the variational quantum linear solver  to solve system of linear equations  of a Least Squares-SVM  on a NISQ device.  The implementation of our approach is evaluated by an extensive series of numerical experiments with the Iris dataset, which consists of three distinct iris plant species. Based on this, we explore the effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a classifier capable of classification in a feature space ranging from one to seven dimensions. Furthermore, we exploit both classical and quantum computing for various subroutines of our algorithm, and effectively mitigate challenges associated with the implementation. These include significant improvement in the trainability of the variational ansatz and notable reductions in run-time for cost  calculations. Based on the numerical experiments, our approach exhibits the capability of identifying a separating hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space. Moreover, it consistently demonstrated strong performance across various instances with the same dataset.

### Summary
The authors propose a so-called variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) enhanced quantum support vector machine (QSVM) to determine the hyperplane of classification problems. The essence of the proposed algorithm is to utilize the Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA) to solve classification problems. Numerical results on the tailored Iris dataset are provided.

### Strengths
The overall structure of this paper is ok.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is too simple and outdated. The essence of this paper is utilizing HEA to solve classification problems which are widely studied in the previous literature [1,2]. Using HEA to solve such a problem is quite trivial and there seems no supremacy in using HEA to solve this kind of problem. There is also literature using Quantum Architecture Search to design problem-specific ansatz for classification problems [3,4]. 
2. This paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the expressivity and the trainability of the proposed quantum ansatz.
3. The tailored Iris dataset is too simple. The authors only conduct experiments with 3 qubits and a very small kernel, which seems no big difference from the toy dataset. The authors constantly mention that the main advancement of this paper is that they use real-world datasets, but results at this level are clearly not enough (with much larger scaling on MNIST [2]). 
4. Poor arrangement with lots of important information in the appendix, leading to difficulty in understanding the paper.
5. **Including acknowledgment in the paper is a clear violation of the double-blind rule of ICLR which should be desk rejected.**

### Rating

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors are motivated by the possibility of applying large-scale quantum support vector machines (QSVM) to real-word problems on near-term, noisy quantum hardware. They propose to use variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) to substitute expensive matrix inverse (done with HHL) in the original approach.

The submission is an interesting but very preliminary work on implementing QSVM using NISQ processors.

### Strengths
The authors assess their approach through a set of numerical experiments using the Iris dataset, which comprises three distinct iris plant species. They evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness by building a classifier capable of handling feature spaces ranging from one to seven dimensions.

Both classical and quantum computing are harnessed by the authors for various parts of their algorithm, effectively mitigating implementation challenges. These improvements include enhancing the trainability of the variational ansatz and reducing runtime for cost calculations. Based on the numerical experiments, the authors' approach demonstrates the ability to identify a separating hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space and consistently delivers strong performance across different instances of the same dataset.

### Weaknesses
The authors do not present any new analytical studies to support their conclusions. The work presented by the authors is entirely numerical. It is not known how the approach will scale with the number of qubits required in the setup. The paper presents only very small numerical examples (3-4 qubits). The method works in that regime but it is not clear how it will behave for qubit counts required to utilize quantum advantage. To remedy the situation, the authors could present large-scale numerical examples or attempt to derive analytical result that would give an argument for favorable scaling.

The authors noted that matrix A may, in general, require exponentially many terms in the decomposition in Eq. (2). [As a side note, they incorrectly called it an eigen decomposition.] That may be a problem that ruins the entire approach. The authors did not present a scalable approach to solve that issue. They propose to perform SVD on the matrix A that improve their results. This is not a scalable solution and introduces other problems such as finding circuits that perform unitary evolution given by V and W in Eq. (5).

Overall, it is hard to be convinced by their results that their work “takes us one step closer to realizing possible practical applications of QSVM on a quantum computer in the NISQ-era”.

### Questions
- The authors could present large-scale numerical examples that would give an argument for favorable scaling under realistic noise models.
- The authors could attempt to derive analytical results to support the feasibility of running QSVM in the NISQ era.

### Summary
The paper proposes to leverage the variational quantum linear system solver (VQLS) in the quantum support vector machines (QSVM), called VQLS-enhanced QSVM. It uses VQLS to obtain a solution to a least-squares problem, which represents a separating hyperplane in QSVM. The design makes use of the advantage of variational algorithms on NISQ devices. The paper then provides an empirical case study on noiseless quantum simulators with a classification dataset in computer vision and a toy dataset. The authors employ a classical SVD process before running the VQLS-enhanced QSVM to reduce the sparsity of the Hamiltonian and improve the performance.

### Strengths
The use of SVD to regularize the data is clever and shows good performance. 
The experiments are described in detail, demonstrating the impact of different subroutines of the proposed procedure.

### Weaknesses
The motivation for using VQLS to obtain a solution to the hyperplane is to have a robust solution on NISQ devices where noises play the main role and obstruct the original HHL subroutine in the QSVM. However, theoretical analysis and experiments in the paper do not provide enough evidence to support the fact that the proposed method mitigates the effects of noise. The theoretical analysis only considers perfect implementation and the experiments are conducted on an ideal circuit simulator. The suggested robustness of the method might be severely limited in the subroutines requiring precise control of the quantum system, e.g., the Hadamard test. The evidence in the paper does not convince me of the necessity of substituting VQLS for HHL in the QSVM in the first place.

The use of SVD to regularize the data seems not scalable. One of the benefits of QSVM is the ability to deal with high-dimensional data, while the classical SVD regularization can only be performed in small cases. This fact limits the scenarios where SVD might be useful. 

The comparison with other quantum machine learning methods is also minimally discussed. The VQLS-enhanced QSVM is compared with only QSVM and SVM in only one example, where the performance of the VQLS-enhanced version seems much poorer than the other methods when the condition number is small.

The SVD regularization is also applicable to QSVM and SVM, while in the experiments it seems that SVD is not applied to the other methods. I believe these are essential to have a fair comparison of the methods.

The lack of consideration of noises also weakens the claims on the effectiveness of SVD. Are the noises affecting the performance of SVD?

### Questions
According to the weakness, several questions are poised:
* How do noises affect the performance of VQLS-enhanced QSVM and HHL-based QSVM?
* How scalable is the SVD regularization?
* What are the performance of other methods in the experiments, with SVD regularization applied?
* How do noises affect the performance of SVD?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new quantum support vector machine (QSVM) based on a variational quantum linear system solver. This method formulates the SVM as a linear programming which is equivalent to solving a system of linear equations (Chua 2003, Robentrost et al. 2014). Then, the system of linear equations is solved with a variational quantum linear system solver due to Bravo-Prieto et al. (2019). The performance of this method is demonstrated on noise-free IBM-Q simulators with 3 qubits (so the dimension of the feature space is $2^3=8$). The numerical experiment uses the Iris dataset. The numerical results show that this new QSVM serves as a good classifier when the condition number of the kernel matrix is small.

### Strengths
The formulation of this work seems reasonable and the preliminaries are written clearly. In previous works (Havlicek et al. 2019, Li et al. 2022, Zhang et al. 2022, Ezawa et al. 2022), a similar variational approach was considered but the numerical experiments were conducted to solve a toy-model problem with only two features. This work conducted numerical experiments with a slightly larger problem (8-dimensional feature space) from the Iris dataset.

### Weaknesses
The method proposed in this paper appears to be a simple combination of two existing subroutines (the least square formulation of SVM and its equivalence to solving linear systems & variational quantum linear system solvers), which does not seem novel. To implement the variational quantum linear system solver, the authors apply SVD to the feature matrix $A$ to get a simpler Pauli decomposition -- this approach seems to be *ad hoc* and not scalable to higher dimensions. The numerical experiment is small (the experiment was simulated using noise-less IBM-Q simulators, not with real quantum hardware) and the results are weak (this new method is not as good as classical ones when the condition number is large).

### Questions
To achieve quantum speedup using a variational quantum linear system solver, the matrix $A$ must be represented as a sum of Pauli (or more generally, unitary) operators. However, in the setting of this paper, the input data (i.e., the matrix $A$) is given as a classical matrix. For ease of implementation, the authors used SVD to get a simple Pauli decomposition of $A$. Using classical SVD to pre-process the data is not scalable, as the cost grows superlinearly with the size of the matrix $A$ (the quantum speedup comes from the assumption that we can represent the matrix $A$ using poly-log quantum resources). In other words, without an efficient data-loading procedure, I do not think the method proposed in this paper would achieve a significant end-to-end quantum advantage on a real NISQ device.
