## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become more similar to artificial neural networks (ANNs) to solve complex machine learning tasks. However, such similarity does not bring superior performances but loses biological plausibility. Moreover, most learning methods of SNNs follow the pattern of gradient descent used in ANNs, which also suffer from low bio-plausibility. To address these issues, a realistic delayed spiking neural network (DSNN) is introduced in this study, which only considers the dendrite and axon delays as the learnable parameters. And a more biologically plausible exponential time-dependent plasticity (ETDP) algorithm is proposed to train the DSNN. The ETDP adjusts the delays according to the global and local time differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes, and the forward and backward propagation time of signals. These biological indicators can surrogate the time-consuming computation of descents precisely. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSNN trained by ETDP achieves very competitive results on various benchmark datasets, compared with other SNNs.

### Summary
This paper proposes a spiking neural network model with only synaptic and axonal delays as variables, and derives an exponential time dependent plasticity learning algorithm. Experiments on several small datasets verify the effectiveness of the method.

### Strengths
This paper considers the important role of synaptic/axonal delays, which is an significant feature of SNNs that is often neglected.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper highlights the biological plausibility, but models with only synaptic and axonal delays as variables are not biologically realistic at all. There are excitatory and inhibitory synapses and the E-I balance is one of the most important features in biological neurons. This paper totally abandons weights and takes them as 1, which is far from reality. While temporal delay is an important feature for SNNs, there is no reason to abandon weights.

2. This paper claims that the proposed ETDP is biologically plausible. Is there any reference, e.g., evidence in neuroscience, supporting such claim? As far as I know, we have no detailed evidence on how biological neurons learn delays as models for learning weights such as STDP. There are also previous methods to learn delays and the comparison between the proposed method and these methods is not discussed.

3. In the paper, it is claimed that “these foundations can be easily generalized to the DSNN with multiple hidden layers by simply updating the forward and reverse timing terms”. However, this seems highly non-trivial. For multi-layer networks with gradient-based supervised learning, it usually involves backpropagation across layers for credit assignment, which is often considered biologically implausible. It is unclear how the proposed method can solve such problem.

4. The experiments are toy and results are relatively poor. The proposed model and algorithm do not reach better STDP results. It is unclear what is the advantage of the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper introduces a Delayed Spiking Neural Network (DSNN), focusing on dendrite and axon delays as the primary learnable parameters. These delays have been observed in natural brain systems, showing their direct impact on spike timings. The DSNN is trained using a novel Exponential Time-Dependent Plasticity (ETDP) algorithm that adjusts delays based on certain biologically-inspired parameters, specifically time differences between different types of spikes and signal propagation times.

### Strengths
The paper is interesting as the proposed method removes the need for the resource-intensive gradient descent calculations traditionally used in ANNs and some SNNs. Experimental findings indicate that the DSNN trained using ETDP not only performs comparably to other SNN models but also maintains a high degree of biological accuracy.

### Weaknesses
There are certain key weaknesses of the paper: The main contribution of the paper seems to be proposing a biologically plausible SNN method. 

Also, the authors point out in the introduction that "The main obstacle to SNNs is the lack of effective learning
algorithms." It seems the motivation of this work was to create a more efficient learning method with which we can achive better performance than simple ANN-to-SNN conversion. However, the performance of this proposed method seems to be worse off than current LIF SNNs with STDP learning. It would be interesting if the authors could give some more motivation and intuition of using such delayed SNNs and ETDP and why that will be better than current methods

Finally the experiments done in the paper are shown in simple datasets (XOR, Iris), and the proposed method fails to outperform current methods on these simple datasets too. This again raises the question of why we need this method in the first place.

### Questions
1. As stated before, it would be good if the authors could give some more motivation as to why this work is important other than biological plausibility as the notion of dealy dependent SNNs itself is not novel [1-3]

2. The authors want to make the model more biologically plausible, but it seems they are using gradient descent to learn the dendrite and the axon delay, which defeats the entire point of unsupervised learning using ETDP/STDP

3. The authors use dendrite and the axon delay in the SNN - it would be good to show the ablation study of the role each of these two delays independently play. 

4. It would be interesting if the authors could add a discussion on what new modes of computation/ advantages this proposed method brings to the table.

5. I know it's difficult, but it would make the paper much more stronger if you could show the results on some datasets which leverages this new delayed SNN/ETDP model where the current models fails.

### Summary
The study presents a Delayed Spiking Neural Network (DSNN) that focuses on dendrite and axon delays as the primary learnable parameters, emphasizing biological plausibility. To train this DSNN, an Exponential Time-Dependent Plasticity (ETDP) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm adjusts delays based on time differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes and signal propagation times. The DSNN, when trained with ETDP, achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets while retaining a high degree of biological authenticity.

### Strengths
The paper's contributions lie in the novel DSNN design, the biologically plausible ETDP training algorithm, and the demonstrated performance on machine learning tasks.

### Weaknesses
1.	While the authors have proposed ETDP for the training of SNNs, based on Eq.7, this method seems to assume \tau=1, implying that it is only applicable to IF neurons. However, the IF neuron is a highly simplified neuron model, which does not align well with the biological plausibility that the authors claim for this method.
2.	Although the authors claim that this approach can easily be extended to deep architectures of DSNN with multiple hidden layers, there is no experimental evidence to support this.
3.	The experiments are quite basic, and the results are not very convincing. The authors have only conducted experiments on the XOR problem, IRIS dataset, and the MNIST/FashionMNIST datasets. For the FashionMNIST dataset, only the accuracy is reported in the paper, without any other benchmark results for comparison. An accuracy of 96.6% on the MNIST dataset is not very compelling, especially when, as the authors mention in Tab.2, previous works have achieved better accuracy than ETDP. Additionally, under the same experimental settings, ETDP's performance is also inferior to GD.

### Questions
1.	In Eq.1, what is \kappa?
2.	In Fig.1, although I can gather information about this figure from the related description in Section 3, the figure does not intuitively convey to readers what its elements represent, especially the relationship between i-1, i+1, and i. Are they neurons from different layers or something else?
3.	I understand the relationship between Section 3 and Section 5, but when Section 4 discusses the non-linearity of spiking neurons, I'm not clear on how this relates to the main theme of the paper.
4.	In Tab.1 and Tab.2, the authors should highlight the method with the best performance, not their own. Highlighting their method can mislead the readers. Also, I suggest separating the results of the proposed method from other methods with horizontal lines.
5.	Given that gradient information is used and BP performance surpasses ETDP, what are the distinctions and advantages of ETDP over BP?
6.	For the XOR problem and the results on FashionMNIST, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis and supporting materials to increase the reader's confidence. This will also offer a more intuitive understanding of the method's performance, rather than just briefly mentioning accuracy in the paper.
