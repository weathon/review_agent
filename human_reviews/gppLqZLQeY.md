- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Subgraph GNNs are provably expressive neural architectures that learn graph representations from sets of subgraphs. Unfortunately, their applicability is hampered by the computational complexity associated with performing message passing on many subgraphs. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning to select a small subset of the large set of possible subgraphs in a data-driven fashion. We first motivate the problem by proving that there are families of WL-indistinguishable graphs for which there exist efficient subgraph selection policies: small subsets of subgraphs that can already identify all the graphs within the family. We then propose a new approach, called _Policy-Learn_, that learns how to select subgraphs in an iterative manner. We prove that, unlike popular random policies and prior work addressing the same problem, our architecture is able to learn the efficient policies mentioned above. Our experimental results demonstrate that _Policy-Learn_ outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of datasets.

### Summary
This paper is motivated by the high computational cost of subgraph GNNs and the bag-of-subgraph contains many redundant information and proposed a learnable method to efficiently select a fixed number of subgraphs for downstream prediction. The proposed method achieves a good balance between the cost and the expressive power. It obtains reasonable performance across various datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper is overall sound and easy to follow. 
2. The motivated CSL example is clear.
3. The proposed method achieves reasonable results across various datasets.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of the paper lie in its insufficient theoretical analyses and experiment validation. Specifically:
1. The proposed method is overall an extension to the 1-MLE method in the OSAN, which is not a big problem to me. However, what I would expect is a more in-depth analysis of the proposed method. The authors only use a single category of graphs (CSL and its $(n, l)$ extension) to show that the proposed method is more powerful than a random policy and OSAN, which is trivial from my perspective. Instead of comparing it with random policy, a more interesting question would be: How well does the proposed method compare to the full-bag version? Can it achieve the same expressive power as the full-bag version and in how much $T$ can it be from a theoretical perspective? 
2. To distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is only the first step towards an expressive GNN. Can the model successfully encode the structure information like counting cycles play a more important role in real-world tasks. Full-bag versions of subgraph GNNs have a much better ability to encode sub-structures [1]. I am wondering can the proposed method maintain its ability to encode sub-structures.
3. Some commonly used synthetic datasets for comparing expressive power are missing (e.g. EXP [2], CSL [3]). This could be part of the answer to weakness 1.
4. Some commonly used synthetic datasets for evaluating the counting power of GNNs are missing [1]. This could be part of the answer to weakness 2.
5. The main contribution of the subgraph sampling is its lower computational cost compared to the full-bag version. However, the authors only show a simple comparison of the inference time using one dataset where the full-bag version is OOM (Table 7). I believe a more comprehensive comparison between the full-bag version and the proposed method is required. What is the time and memory cost of the proposed method compared to the full-bag version in both the train and the test? How does the cost vary if we increase the $T$?

### Questions
1. The current method only works for node-based subgraphs. Could the proposed method be generalized to other policies like edge-based [1] or node-tuple-based [2] subgraphs?

### Summary
The paper focuses on learning effective subgraph selection policies for subgraph GNNs. In particular, it is inspired by an observation that only a small number of subgraphs are needed to differentiate a family of non-isomorphic graphs called the CSL graph. Based on the observation, it constructs a learning-based subgraph selection policy and surpasses previous works on various benchmarks.

### Strengths
Generally speaking, I like the efforts on subgraph sampling since the efficiency of subgraph GNNs limits them from being applied in real-world scenarios. In addition, the work is generally motivated and well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. Most subgraph sampling strategies face a problem: they cannot guarantee permutation invariance, i.e., generate the same representation for the same graph no matter how the graph is permuted. It seems that the proposed method also cannot guarantee such property as well.

2. I appreciate the efforts in distinguishing the CSL graphs. However, CSL graphs are just a family of regular graphs that cannot be differentiated by 1-WL. Have you analyzed some other families, for example, the strongly regular graphs proposed in (Bodnar et al, 2021b) or some pairs of graphs that are mentioned in (Wang and Zhang 2023)?

3. It seems that the time evaluation is only provided in Table 7, where the time of the full subgraph GNN is not provided due to OOM. I recommend adding time evaluation on more datasets, and reporting the time of "policy learn", "random selection", the full subgraph GNN, and MPNNs. For example, you can report the time of GIN, OSAN, FULL, RANDOM, and POLICY-LEARN on ZINC.

### Questions
Definition 2 and Theorem 1 could possibly lead to some misunderstandings. For example, from my perspective, if the multiset $\\{k_i| i\in \\{1,\dots, l \\}\\}$ is the same, then $CSL(n,(k_1, …, k_l))$ should be isomorphic to each other. The observation should be pointed out, since the definition now seems that the sequence of k_i might also lead to non-isomorphism. In addition, the fact that $CSL (n, k)$ is isomorphic to $CSL (n, n-k)$ would also influence the isomorphism between graphs, which also need to be mentioned.

### Summary
**TLDR**: The paper proposes a learnable subsampling policy to reduce the number of sampled subgraphs in subgraph GNNs.

Subgraph GNNs refer to the family of message-passing graph neural networks which sample subgraphs to improve their expressive power. The paper introduces a new subsampling strategy, _Policy-Learn_ which aims to reduce the number of subgraphs needed for subgraph GNNs. _Policy-Learn_ consists of two subgraph GNNs, one selection network $f$ and one policy network $g$: $f$ learns a distribution over the nodes of the input graph to select which subgraph to sample next, $g$ takes the sampled graphs as input and performs a prediction task. The paper motivates _Policy-Learn_ by considering the graph class of $(n,\ell)$-CSL graphs, where one instance consists of $\ell$ disconnected, non-isomorphic CSL graphs on $n$ nodes. For $(n, \ell)$-CSL graphs, _Policy-Learn_ only needs to sample $\ell$ subgraphs in comparison to random subsampling and the existing subsampling strategy OSAN. In an experimental evaluation, _Policy-Learn_ outperforms OSAN and is, on average, competitive with the presented baseline methods.

### Strengths
* The proposed subsampling strategy _Policy-Learn_ is well-motivated and novel.
* _Policy-Learn_ can provably sample subgraphs such that non-isomorphic instances can be distinguished for one specific graph class ($(n, \ell)$-CSL graphs) on which 1-WL fails.
* In the experimental evaluation, _Policy-Learn_ is competitive with most baseline methods and outperforms OSAN

### Weaknesses
* Theoretical limitations: While the presented theoretical results are novel and interesting, they also appear to be limited. The artificially constructed graph class $(n, \ell$)-CSL is 1-WL indistinguishable; however, higher-order models and GNN variants are able to distinguish them. A more comprehensive analysis of the expressive power of _Policy-Learn_ could strengthen the contribution significantly.
* Clarity: Although the paper is generally well-written, more precise language would improve readability:
     * "[...] preventing the applicability of Subgraph GNNs on important datasets" -> What datasets are important?
    * "Contributions: [...] An experimental evaluation of the new approach demonstrating its advantages." -> It would be more informative if the advantages are specified.
    * " [...] which includes feature aggregation in light of the alignment of nodes [...]" -> Could you specify what that means
    * "[...] and demonstrate that our framework performs better on real-word datasets" -> Better than what?

### Questions
1. **Expressiveness**: _Policy-Learn_ can distinguish non-isomorphic instances in the graph class $(n, \ell)$-CSL, which are indistinguishable by 1-WL. What about the opposite? Can you characterize graph classes whose non-isomorphic instances are provably indistinguishable by _Policy-Learn_? Are there graph classes where OSAN is stronger than _Policy-Learn_? Is _Policy-Learn_ limited by higher-order WL?
2. **Assumption in proof of Theorem 4**: Is the (necessary) assumption that $f$ has $n$ layers feasible for larger graphs? Do you have experimental results on $(n, \ell)$-CSL graphs?
3. **Extension of theoretical results**: Have you thought about extensions of your theoretical results, e.g., other graph classes where marking any node in a graph is sufficient or where marking a limited number of nodes is sufficient?
4. **Experiments**:

    a. How did you choose the values for $T$ (2 and 5 in Tables 1 and 3, 2 and 20 in Table 2)?

    b. In Section 7, paragraph ZINC: "Notably, OSAN performs worse than our random baseline due to differences in the implementation of the prediction network". Could you elaborate on the differences and why this affects the performance?
5. **Time comparison**: How does _Policy-Learn_ compare with respect to time vs. prediction performance in comparison to more expressive GNNs (e.g., GSN, CIN)?

### Summary
Subgraph GNNs generally refers to GNN methods that run GNNs on several subgraphs obtained from the input graph. Recently, a variety of such methods, differing from each other in the subgraph selection policies, are proposed. Of particular relevance to the current paper is the OSAN framework by Qian et al, in which the subgraph selection policy is learned. In the current paper, a more expressive GNN architecture DS-GNN is used (rather than a classical GNNs) of the subgraph selection policy. This DS-GNN provides a distribution from which is sampled using standard Gumbel softmax trick. It is shown theoretically the approach can be more powerful than the OSAN approach.

### Strengths
1. Research in how to learn subgraph selection policies is highly relevant in view of the popularity of subgraph GNN approaches.

2. Related work is well described.

3. The policy learn method is well designed.

4. Theoretical guarantees over special classes of CSL graphs are presented. In particular, it is argued that the proposed approach can be stronger than a previous approach.

### Weaknesses
1. It is not clearly described what gives the proposed method more power than e.g., OSAN.

2. The method seems to depend on a subgraph GNN method (DS-GNN) which high computational cost.

### Questions
**Q1** Could you explain the histograms in Figure 1 after labeling one vertex? 

**Q2** What is the ingredient of the method which results in more power than say OSAN?

**Q3** Is the proposed method at least as powerful as OSAN or incomparable? What about comparisons with other subgraph formalisms?

**Q4** A number of subgraphs are selected in order to reduce complexity. However, the DS-GNN method used for selection policy relies on all subgraphs? What is the overall complexity of the method?
