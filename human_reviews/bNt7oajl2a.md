# Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models with Hypothesis Refinement

- Decision: Accept (oral)

## Abstract
The ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and then generalize to novel situations---known as inductive reasoning---is central to human intelligence. Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through $\textit{iterative hypothesis refinement}$, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal $\textit{hypothesis proposers}$ (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling $\textit{inductive reasoners}$, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.

### Summary
This work examines the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs, decomposing this process into two distinct stages: hypothesis proposal and rule application. The results suggest that LLMs are often able to propose reasonable hypotheses, but less reliable at applying those hypothesized rules. A neurosymbolic approach is proposed in which LLM-proposed hypotheses are symbolically implemented, improving performance on multiple inductive reasoning tasks.

### Strengths
- Diverse set of tasks
- Thorough evaluation, evaluating range of hyperparameters, metrics, and base models
- The proposed approach, hypothesis refinement, is interesting and yields improved performance across multiple tasks. The approach also has interesting connections to human reasoning.
- The distinction between hypothesis proposal and rule application generates useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of reasoning in LLMs.

### Weaknesses
- The results would be more informative if compared directly with human performance. Do any of these benchmarks contain human performance measures (e.g. I believe that there is already human behavioral data for miniSCAN in the original paper)?
- The results on noisy rule induction are especially difficult to interpret without a human baseline. The authors cite a paper indicating that humans are somewhat robust to noise when inducing rules, but the amount of noise and the specific tasks will matter a lot. 
- Throughout the paper, the authors appeal to intuition concerning putative human performance on the benchmarks they consider (e.g. in considering the potential for human reasoners to show a discrepancy between hypothesis generation and rule application), but intuition is not always a reliable guide regarding human performance. It would be good to qualify these statements a bit more (or, to the extent possible, to include a direct comparison with human performance).
- The 'task accuracy' measure seems designed to emphasize the consistency of the symbolic rule application. When looking at raw accuracy, the differences between symbolic and LLM rule application don't look nearly as large. I think this somewhat undermines the claim that their rule application abilities are so much worse than their hypothesis generation abilities. 
- It should be emphasized more that miniARC, unlike the other tasks, is a distinctly visual task, in that it requires understanding visual concepts like 'objectness'. It is somewhat unsurprising that a text-only model would show special difficulty on such a task.
- Do the authors have any explanation for why the hypothesis refinement approach achieves worse performance on miniARC relative to the baselines? Given the visual nature of the task, it's not surprising that it doesn't help much, but I was surprised that it actually seems to impair performance.
- The familiarity analysis seems to confound two very different issues: 1) The presence of the same exact problems in the LLM pretraining data (a significant possibility, given the use of pre-existing datasets), and 2) the use of familiar vs. unfamiliar words (e.g. pseudowords). I think it's important to dissociate these concerns. This can be done by creating a new dataset with similar properties, e.g. by replacing the specific pseudowords and colors in miniSCAN (but maintaining the same general pseudoword -> color structure). 
- Is the interaction between iid vs. ood and IO vs. hypothesis refinement (figure 2) statistically significant? Also, the text describes the hypothesis refinement results as demonstrating superior robustness to this ood setting, but for miniARC the ood accuracy is actually higher for the IO baseline (even though the difference between iid and ood performance is larger for IO). This should be clarified in the text.
- Were the language model and human hypotheses systematically compared in any way, or only qualitatively inspected? Did the strength of the language model hypotheses correspond to performance on the task? Were there cases where the model performed well on the task despite providing unhuman-like hypotheses?

## Minor comments:
- What setting was used for the 'top p' parameter in GPT-4?
- It would be helpful to either include the variable names in figure 1, or to have a separate figure illustrating the overall flow of the model with the corresponding variable names.
- It would be good to say a bit more about how this work differs from Wang et al (2023). This is concurrent work, so there is no concern about novelty, but it would still be useful to have more discussion of the relationship.
- I found the description of the approach somewhat confusing. Based on the abstract and intro, I was expecting that the hypotheses would be articulated in natural language, and this would somehow be translated into code which is then symbolically executed. It is explained later on (in section 2.2) that the LM also carries out this translation step for list functions and miniARC, but it would be good to provide some hint that this is the case earlier in the section describing the approach. My understanding is that for the other tasks, the LM is prompted so as to ensure hypotheses in a particular format, which can then be automatically parsed, is that correct? It would be helpful to clarify this (in section 2 it says that the hypotheses are 'constrained', but it's not immediately clear what that means).
- I found this sentence, 'However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules)…' to be confusing, because it seems to say that LLMs are bad at proposing rules, even though it was just stated that they are good at this. This also seems misaligned with the results. It seems like this sentence should instead emphasize the rule application specifically (though, as mentioned above, it's not clear how significant this discrepancy really is).
- The authors might consider citing this related work on analogical reasoning (a special case of inductive reasoning) in LLMs: Webb, T., Holyoak, K. J., & Lu, H. (2023). Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models. Nature Human Behaviour.

### Summary
The paper explores the inductive reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through iterative hypothesis refinement. The key ideas are:

- Inductive reasoning involves proposing hypotheses to explain observations, selecting the best hypothesis, and refining it based on new examples. This process mirrors
human inductive reasoning.
- The authors test LLMs on this through:
    1. Using the LLM to propose rule hypotheses based on examples
    2. Testing the rules using symbolic interpreters or LLMs as rule appliers on new examples
    3. Providing feedback to the LLM to further refine the rules
- Experiments on 4 datasets show LLMs are phenomenal at proposing plausible hypotheses when combined with symbolic interpreters. Iterative refinement significantly improves
performance.
- However, LLMs display counter-intuitive inductive behaviors compared to humans:
    - They struggle to apply their own proposed rules
    - They are brittle to minor perturbations in examples
    - Their induced rules differ in content and form from human-proposed rules

### Strengths
- Well motivated, clear and flows well. I really enjoyed reading the paper.
- The paper tackles an important problem in reasoning, reasoning inductively by proposing hypotheses.
- The domains are well defined and the content is diverse.
- The human experiments are insightful - comparing induced rules reveals qualitative gaps between LLMs and human reasoning.
- The paper makes an important contribution in carefully evaluating both strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for inductive reasoning.
- The analysis is thorough, spanning different models, datasets, and evaluations.
- The limitations, scope and results are clearly defined and discussed.

Overall, this is a clearly written, rigorous, and impactful study that advances our understanding of inductive reasoning in LLMs. The paradoxical findings are intriguing and point to promising future directions.

### Weaknesses
- An analysis of the complexity of the rules used to generate the data would be interesting. Comparing the complexity of the hypothesis across tasks and domains might give some insight into the model performance.
- Similarly, the complexity of the human induced and LLM induced rules might be interesting to analyze.
- How were the number of examples seen by the model chosen across domains? What is the minimum number of examples needed to learn a rule?
- An open source model would make the evaluations more comprehensive.
- A separate evaluation for LLMs as symbolic interpreters of rules would help tease apart the rule-proposing / application componenets more. More on complexity: LMs might be bad appliers of complex rules.
- Can LLMs apply rules induced by humans?
- Is there a change in the types of rules induced if the prompt is changed to encourage communication (since this was what humans seemed to do)? Change prompt to emphasize communication?

### Summary
This paper investigates the inductive reasoning capacities of language models on a set of tasks, in terms of hypothesis proposal, selection, and refinement and then analyzes how the hypotheses differ from human ones.

### Strengths
Although the tasks are somewhat toy, the paper demonstrates its claims, is well-written, and is relatively comprehensive. They perform a novel analysis of the kinds of hypotheses and the model's ability to apply them. This is (in my view) a clear contribution, and I have no substantial criticisms.

### Weaknesses
A few of the experiment setups feel a bit contrived - for example, randomly perturbing a set of items in a small set of experiments, of course, makes the task harder for a language model since it also requires it to infer that the noise is noise and not itself a deterministic part of the rule. The section on familiarity of exemplars should also likely mention Dasgupta et al.'s "Language models show human-like content effects" there.

### Questions
I'm curious about how this paper squares with some results like that in the after-submission-deadline "Large Language Models Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet" from Huang et al. (2023). The point there was that language models, given the opportunity to revise their reasoning, will often make it worse. In practice, did you see this when refining hypotheses? It would be interesting to see how the number of revisions affects performance, similar to Table 2 in the concurrent "Hypothesis Search" paper from Wang et al. I see there is some version of this in this paper's Table 2, but given the emphasis that this paper places of hypothesis refinement, I'd expect a bit more detail. Especially given the self-consistency, it would be valuable to understand the tradeoff between more attempts and more revisions.

### Summary
The paper focuses on evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of large language models. Given input examples, the authors propose a three-stage process that first asks LLMs to propose hypotheses about the task, and then use a domain-specific interpreter to evaluate hypotheses on input examples, finally, hypotheses that pass most input examples are used to apply to unseen examples for testing.  The authors also propose to leverage interpreter results of hypotheses as feedback to refine the hypotheses. Experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on 4 inductive reasoning datasets. The authors then show various differences between humans and LLMs through additional experiments such as asking LLMs to apply rules without interpreters and perturbing part of input examples. These experiments demonstrate the behavior difference between humans and LLMs on inductive reasoning tasks.

### Strengths
- The author proposes an effective approach that disentangles the inductive reasoning task into the process of proposing a hypothesis and interpreting the hypothesis that shows strong performance compared with recent approaches that use various types of prompting without external interpreters.
- The proposed method is validated on multiple large language models by comprehensive experiments on 4 datasets of different domains, showing the generalizability of the method.

### Weaknesses
My concern mainly lies in Section 4:

- For the example perturbation experiment in section 4.2, there are no studies on how well humans can actually perform on perturbed tasks. It is hard to judge how big the performance drop of LMs is compared with humans.
- Experiments in 4.1 and 4.2 are conducted with simple prompting which may not be the most effective method to elicit this type of reasoning from the model.
- The generalizability of the findings in 4.3 is doubtful because only one type of prompt is used to generate rules from LM. According to the appendix, example rules on List Fn and MiniARC are generated from LM with a prompt that contains no format instruction. It is unknown whether LMs can generate human-like inductions with more guidance or provided with human-induced rules as few shot examples.

Overall, I believe the main contribution of the paper is an effective inductive reasoning pipeline using LMs. So these are not significant flaws of the paper. So I still recommend acceptance. However, I strongly encourage authors to provide more rigorous evidence when making claims in Section 4.

### Questions
- What are the prompts used to generate the Python program from rules for List Functions and MiniARC?
- In Table 2, on MiniScan, T=3, N=1 yields higher raw accuracy and task accuracy than T=3, N=5, which means that fewer hypotheses considered lead to worse performance. Is there an explanation for this?
- In Section 2, the authors claim to evaluate models on “OOD” examples by generating longer or larger examples than those in the original datasets. This is a bit confusing. Are authors actually fixing the seen examples and only changing the unseen examples for testing?
- When asking LMs to write Python programs given the hypothesis, are the seen examples also provided in the prompt?
