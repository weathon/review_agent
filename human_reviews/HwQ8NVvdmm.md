- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Continual learning is a desirable feature in many modern machine learning applications, which allows in-field adaptation and updating, ranging from accommodating distribution shift, to fine-tuning, and to learning new tasks. For applications with privacy and low latency requirements, the compute and memory demands imposed by continual learning can be cost-prohibitive for resource-constraint edge platforms. Reducing computational precision through fully quantized training (FQT) simultaneously reduces memory footprint and increases compute efficiency for both training and inference. However, aggressive quantization especially integer FQT typically degrades model accuracy to unacceptable levels. In this paper, we propose a technique that leverages inexpensive Hadamard transforms to enable low-precision training with only integer matrix multiplications. We further determine which tensors need stochastic rounding and propose tiled matrix multiplication to enable low-bit width accumulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on several human activity recognition datasets and CIFAR100 in a class incremental learning setting. We achieve less than 0.5% and 3% accuracy degradation while we quantize all matrix multiplications inputs down to 4-bits with 8-bit accumulators.

### Summary
This paper try to deal with two important subjects in deep learning field at the same time. - Quantization and Continual learning.
Quantization is a promising way to reduce costs of deep neural networks inference. Furthermore, there is a way to reduce training cost that is much more huge than inference cost by using low bit numerical formats, which is called FQT (Fully Quantized Training). CL (Continual learning) is a research field that try to handle a realistic scenario; the number of categories are not fixed and new categories and data can be added while previous ones aren’t available. 

However, FQT and training under CL scenarios are both harmful to the performance of networks. Thus, it is obvious that executing FQT under CL scenarios leads to unacceptable performance degradation. That’s why it is hard to find a trial to deal with both subjects simultaneously, even though these two topics are much important in practice.

To solve this problem, the paper introduces Hadamard transform, which is an inexpensive operation, in the training process. By applying Hadamard transform and stochastic rounding to the backward pass of training process, the proposed method make FQT possible under CL scenarios, with little to no sacrifice in performance.

### Strengths
- This paper is the very first work that trying to solve FQT and CL simultaneously.
- There is little performance degradation, despite that FQT is executed under continual learning scenarios.

### Weaknesses
- Previous CL works that the paper cites were presented years ago, and the paper doesn’t address recent works.
- The paper doesn’t show experimental results that use larger and more realistic datasets, such as ImageNet.
- The formula of Hadamard transform is wrong; $H_k = [H_k  \quad H_{k-1};   H_{k-1} \quad  -H_{k-1}]$ -> $H_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [H_k    \quad H_{k-1};   H_{k-1} \quad -H_{k-1}]$
- There are some figures that are hard to recognize.
    - In Figure 2, the first three rows compare standard quantization and Hadamard quantization, and the last row is an ablation study of quantizing tensors in the backward pass and accumulator quantization. However, because they aren’t properly distinguished, it seems that the last row also shows a comparison between standard quantization and Hadamard quantization.
    - Likewise, in Figure 4, the first three rows and the last row should have been distinguished.
- In Table 2, a 4-bit input and 12-bit accumulator for previous works is critical to compare the proposed method with other works. However, those results aren’t provided.

### Questions
- There already is a previous work that applies the Hadamard transform to quantization. What’s different between the previous work and the proposed method?
- It seems too harsh to apply FQT and CL simultaneously. Can an example of a scenario that should apply FQT and CL together be provided?
- It helps understand how effective the proposed method is if results about FQT under CL scenarios without Hadamard transform are provided. Can the results be provided?

### Weaknesses
1. The introudction of Hadamard Domain is missing. Readers unfamiliar with the field are confused with its application in this submission.
2. Introducing extrac matrix H brings in more parameters for training. Besides, how to determine the parameter H (trainable or pre-calculated) is not mentioned.
3. The proposed algorithm is not connected to Class Incremental Learning (CIL).

### Summary
This paper introduces a technique using Hadamard transforms for low-precision training with integer matrix multiplications, addressing the accuracy degradation issue of aggressive quantization. Also, the authors further determine which tensors need stochastic rounding and propose tiled matrix multiplication to enable low-bit width accumulators. With this, the proposed method, proven on human activity recognition datasets and CIFAR100, achieves accuracy degradation of less than 0.5% and 3% and quantizes all matrix multiplication inputs to 4 bits using an 8-bit accumulator.

### Strengths
* This work is clearly written and proposes a principled and efficient method of solving the non-uniformity of gradients during backward propagation.
* Whereas previous works have proposed log scaling of values, this is impractical to implement efficiently on hardware. Also, it is difficult to guess the necessary value range beforehand. The Hadamard transform is both efficient to implement and is ideally suited to removing gradient spikes while preserving information. As such, there is potential for Hadamard domain backpropagation in reduced-precision training. 
* In the backpropagation process, utilizing HDQT allows setting the input and accumulation bit-width to 4 and 8 bits, respectively, showcasing improved energy efficiency compared to conventional CIL methods.
* The authors present promising results on image datasets (CIFAR100) and human activity recognition datasets (DSADS, PAMAP2, HAPT), demonstrating a degradation of ≤ 2.5% through quantization in vision tasks.

### Weaknesses
* It is difficult to understand the motivation for connecting continual learning with integer valued training. While edge devices have fewer resources for training, they would not be expected to perform much training or have it completed quickly. Therefore, it would be difficult to justify the additional expense in both software and hardware when the same result can be obtained simply by waiting for a few more hours. 
* More experiments on different domains are necessary to support the claims of the efficacy of Hadamard domain quantization. For a fairer comparison, there should be a comparison using other methods used in fully quantized training when applied to continual learning. Moreover, there should be a comparison with previous methods when training from scratch, not just during continual learning.
* The method proposed in the paper would be difficult to implement due to the requirement for stochastic rounding, which cannot be easily implemented in hardware, integer-based or otherwise. Even if such hardware could be implemented, this would require custom circuitry solely for that purpose.

### Questions
* In Section 4.4, when discussing the energy estimates derived from the accelerator cost model for HDQT application, there is a concern that if the training time increases due to HDQT, it may consume more energy than conventional methods. Can the experiments include a comparison of training times when applying HDQT?
* When examining the results for CIFAR100 in Table 1, the accuracy degradation appears to be relatively higher compared to other datasets. It seems that the trend may vary depending on the dataset or network architecture. Have there been results applying the method to more complex network architectures or larger datasets?
* While there are advantages to performing matrix multiplication as integer-arithmetic units through HDQT, it is likely that the overhead for Quantization and Stochastic Quantization cannot be ignored, especially as the batch size increases. I am curious about the energy efficiency, including the overhead for Quantization and Stochastic Quantization, as the batch size becomes larger.

### Summary
This paper applies fully-quantized training (FQT) to class incremental learning (CIL) by representing activation, weight, and gradient using reduced precision. The paper employs the Hadamard transform for more efficient bit utilization during quantization, applies stochastic rounding to quantization-sensitive activation and gradient in the backward pass, and utilizes tiled quantization for minimal error during partial sum accumulation. The proposed approach enables efficient CIL with 4-bit matrix multiplication and 8-bit accumulation, minimizing performance degradation.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a comprehensive background and overview of the proposed approach.
- This paper is the first to apply low-performance degradation FQT to CIL, and it presents results through extensive comparisons with various CIL techniques and existing FQT methods.
- The paper demonstrates the hardware advantages of the proposed 4-bit integer FQT over 16-bit operations through an energy table.

### Weaknesses
- This paper lacks novelty. While it introduces FQT to CIL, it is unclear whether the proposed method offers something significantly new compared to the existing FQT with Hadamard transform [1]. Also, the explanation regarding one of the paper's contributions, tiled matrix multiplication, does not provide sufficient details such as hyperparameters like tile size, which are essential for both accuracy and hardware cost. Additionally, the paper does not explain any distinctive aspects compared to chunk-based accumulation proposed in other existing FQT methods [2].
- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the overhead incurred by Hadamard transformations in the training process. Furthermore, in [1], Hadamard transformation was used effectively to manage outliers occurring in specific channels of the Transformer model. However, this paper lacks a clear explanation of why the Hadamard transformation is particularly necessary for CIL. In Section 3, the direct relevance of being 'more efficient in using available quantization levels' to performance is not well-established.
- The rationale behind using stochastic rounding is unclear. In Figure 2 (right), the sensitivity of activation and gradient quantization in the backward pass to unbiased quantizers lacks a clear bridge of explanation. There is a lack of description regarding which factors among bias and variance make gradient and activation quantization in the backward pass challenging.
- The hardware comparison is unfair. While this paper emphasizes the retention of performance with fewer accumulation bits compared to other FQT methods, the hardware evaluation is conducted against hardware using 16-bit activation/accumulation. This makes it difficult to intuitively understand how reducing the accumulation of bits benefits the hardware.

### Questions
- What are particular characteristics of CIL (distinct from NoCL) that require innovation for existing FQT? 
- Is it possible to achieve a practical speed-up through the proposed method? Additionally, I'm curious about the overhead incurred by Hadamard transformation.
- I'm curious about the hardware benefits of using 8-bit or 12-bit accumulation with 4-bit input compared to 16-bit accumulation.
- In Table 2, HDQT in BiC exhibits both high accuracy and a high forget score. I'm curious if this is simply a result of overtraining the model or if it has achieved better performance than other methods.
- As depicted in Figure 1, it seems that the input and weight undergo a process of quantization-transformation-quantization when used in the backward pass. I wonder about the impact of double quantization like this.
