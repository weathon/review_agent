## Abstract
Large discrete action spaces (LDAS) remain a central challenge in reinforcement learning. Existing solution approaches can handle unstructured LDAS with up to a few million actions. However, many real-world applications in logistics, production, and transportation systems have combinatorial action spaces, whose size grows well beyond millions of actions, even on small instances. Fortunately, such action spaces exhibit structure, e.g., equally spaced discrete resource units. With this work, we focus on handling structured LDAS (SLDAS) with sizes that cannot be handled by current benchmarks: we propose Dynamic Neighborhood Construction (DNC), a novel exploitation paradigm for SLDAS. We present a scalable neighborhood exploration heuristic that utilizes this paradigm and efficiently explores the discrete neighborhood around the continuous proxy action in structured action spaces with up to $10^{73}$ actions. We demonstrate the performance of our method by benchmarking it against three state-of-the-art approaches designed for large discrete action spaces across three distinct environments. Our results show that DNC matches or outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while being computationally more  efficient. Furthermore, our method scales to action spaces that so far remained computationally intractable for existing methodologies.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors present an approach for learning in environments with large, discrete action spaces. Specifically, they learn policies in a continuous space that can be mapped to the discrete actions. The mapping the propose leverages structure in the discrete space in which it performs a localized search to efficiently perform the mapping.

### Strengths
**Originality:** The work presented in this paper is novel as far as I know. They propose an approach that has not been done before that attempts to mitigates drawbacks exhibited by other algorithms.

**Quality:** The problem is well-motivated and the drawbacks of current SOTA approaches for the problem are identified and the authors describe sufficiently how their approach attempts to tackle one of these issues. While I have not delved thoroughly into the appendix to check every bit of the theory, the sketched out lemmas seem sound. The experiments conducted were reasonable and thorough enough (I appreciate the ablation study performed.)

**Clarity:** Easy to read and understand.

**Significance:** I believe this work could be impactful to others in the area.

### Weaknesses
My one issue is with the first set of experiments in the maze. The results do not really demonstrate that DNC actually provides any advantage over the other baselines. While the second set of experiments do, I think maybe adding another domain may support performance claims by the authors. Alternatively, if the argument is that the performance of DNC is competitive to other SOTA, what other benefits may it provide (better wall-clock time, memory usage, etc.)?

### Questions
Tiny nitpick: The second sentence in Problem Definition --- it would read better to describe the states and actions in the order you introduce them.

### Summary
Given the need in fields like inventory management, an efficient method for RL with structured large discrete action spaces (n-dimensional lattices) is proposed. First a continuous action is generated and discretized, then through simulated annealing with perturbation defined by other actions on the lattice with low hamming distance, a final proposed discrete action is obtained. This avoids the necessity of constructing extremely large nearest neighbor graphs, or solving a linear program on every forward pass. The convergence for the action selection process is proven, and the method is evaluated in two simulated domains with strong results over baselines.

### Strengths
- The method is well-motivated
- Results are strong over baselines in Figure 3
- Components are ablated

### Weaknesses
I should first couch my review by noting I'm not the most familiar with the literature in this area, so this is an educated guess:

- The maze domain seems a bit too trivial to be useful, it is informative for a demonstration of the method, but unlike the inventory management environment, I'm not sure what the real-world justification might be. I would prefer to have at least one more grounded and complex environment (perhaps a video game with many different possible actions, perhaps a multi-agent setting? I'm not the most familiar with the domains in this subfield).
- Perhaps this is my unfamiliarity with the domain, but sometimes the text is quite hard to follow. I think part of this is the reliance on lots of acronyms (LDAS, SLDAS, MILP, SA), but also the claim in Section 2 "we formulate the task of finding a Q-value maximizing a as a mixed-integer linear program" was a bit confusing on first read, as really the authors are proposing an approximate solution, so saying this upfront might be a bit more clear.
- Would be nice to see MILP results in Figure 5 against the proposed method and other baselines in Figure 3, and the discussion at the end of Appendix B is informative and it may be nice to have a note in the text

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of reinforcement learning in large discrete action spaces, which vanilla techniques typically cannot handle, and require adaptations. The authors propose a technique that, similarly to other works, outputs a continuous action, which is then mapped to a valid discrete action that is executed in the environment. Their proposal applies for action spaces that are regularly structured (e.g., an equally-spaced grid), which allows the method to circumvent needing to store the valid actions in memory. Instead, to map to a discrete action, a simulated annealing search is proposed, that is shown (via reasonable assumption and a standard analysis technique) to yield actions that improve the (estimated) Q-value. The method is evaluated in environments with an exponential number of actions, showing similar performance with prior methods in regimes with less actions, and better performance in regimes with more actions.

### Strengths
**S1**. The proposed technique is simple, elegant, and rigorously analyzed. It is also shown to work well empirically in environments that satisfy the required conditions.

**S2**. The writing of the paper is excellent and clear.

### Weaknesses
**W1**. My primary criticism is that the considered environments and scenarios where the technique applies are somewhat contrived. If one is faced with such a huge decision space, we would typically expect to spend the time in the modelling stage of the problem to design an action space that is substantially more manageable. For example, in the maze environment, we could design a discrete set of actions (move left, etc.), with the actual execution being handled by lower-level control primitives. Indeed, this needs to be performed for each individual problem (as the authors do mention).

**W2**. I also have some concerns about the evaluation:

- Firstly, for the maze environments, the variability of the techniques is such that the confidence intervals overlap substantially, and it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from these figures alone. Would this still happen with substantially more seeds (e.g. 50+)? Alternatively, would another procedure (e.g., running many episodes with randomly initialised positions) yield more reliable (i.e., with non-overlapping CIs)?
- The simulated annealing search procedure must introduce a computational overhead compared to picking the best action greedily (e.g., as in DNC w/o SA). This is not mentioned, and the impact on runtimes is not analyzed or discussed. This needs to be addressed, accompanied by measurements.

### Questions
**C1**. The paper refers in several places to approaches for "unstructured" LDAS (abstract, intro, figure 1, etc.). This is somewhat of a misnomer since these problems *do* exhibit structure (i.e., the action space is such that actions that are close in embedding space yield similar Q-values and lead to similar outcomes when actuated in the environment). I think a better term would be *irregularly* structured. Similarly, the proposed method applies to *regularly* structured action spaces.

**C2**. Related to the second point of W2 above, the paper mentions the use of "SA to efficiently search across different and potentially better neighborhoods" (Discussion on p6). While this statement potentially applies for the memory efficiency, it certainly doesn't in terms of time, and should be qualified. SA in general is not computationally efficient.

**C3**. Small nitpick: "Constraints 2" -> "Constraint 2", etc. in the text at the end of Section 2.
