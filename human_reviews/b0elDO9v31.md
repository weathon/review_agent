## Abstract
Rephrasing the convolution operation from Euclidean to non-Euclidean domains, such as graphs and surfaces, is of great interest in the context of geometric deep learning.
By elaborating on closing a theoretical gap between an existing framework for the parametric construction of non-Euclidean convolutions and a sound theoretical definition for intrinsic surface convolutions, motivated by differential geometry, we show that existing definitions for surface convolutions only differ in their prior assumptions about local surface information.
In the course of our efforts we found a canonical prior that allows for a theoretical definition of the class of Intrinsic Mesh CNNs, which captures the CNNs that operate on surfaces.
This class combines the practical advantages of the framework for the parametric construction of non-Euclidean convolutions with a substantiated theory, that allows for further theoretical analysis and interesting research questions.
Eventually, we conduct an experimental investigation of the canonical prior, the results of which confirm our theory about its canonical nature.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors relate three special cases of intrinsic convolutions on surfaces to the generic formulation in terms of gauge and template functions.

They further show how different choices of templates can influence the features learnt in conjunction with the weighting function, naming these choices prior as they may encode assumptions made about the surface properties the network can learn.

From the formulation of Monti, they introduce a Dirac distribution prior taken as the zero variance limit of Gaussian functions. They characterise the set of learnable features for the Dirac prior and claim it is more general than others as it is "not limited by an integral".

Finally, the authors conduct experimental evaluations using different choices of priors, taken to be the density functions of several usual probability distributions. In the experimental setting of learning dense point correspondences, they show the Dirac prior outperforms the other choices.

### Strengths
The paper relates three milestone formulations of intrinsic convolutions on surfaces to the general theory of convolution in the tangent space with a choice of gauge. The authors introduce a partial order to the set of priors through a notion of what prior is more powerful - i.e., can a prior learn the same features as another.

### Weaknesses
The authors focus on a limited body of work in the geometric deep learning literature, namely, three early formulations of intrinsic convolutions. Furthermore, they only cite one reference regarding all the theoretical framework of gauge equivariant CNNs, Bronstein et al., 2021. Combined, these two factors mean the paper ignores important references on gauge equivariant CNNs published before (Cohen et al.) or at the same time (Weiler et al.) the book cited, as well as other related works on convolutions for surfaces and 3D shapes (e.g., Tangent Convolutions for Dense Prediction in 3D in CVPR 2018, MeshCNN, and others).

The mathematical derivations contain typos (the limit of Gaussian functions for decreasing variance should be for n -> 0 not n -> +oo), and the use of the notation $\Delta_{\theta}$ and $\Delta_{\theta, w}$ should be introduced. The authors should introduce the change of integration domain from [0, 1]^n to BR(0) before Theorem 1. The theorem itself is a direct application of Fubini's theorem and as such is not a particularly strong theoretical result of the paper.

As noted by the authors themselves, the Dirac distribution is not a function. This weakens the link with the theoretical results presented before.

The authors claim to "we show that existing definitions for surface convolutions only differ in their prior assumptions about local surface information". It is known in the community, and the authors show it for the formulation of Monti only, who had already shown their formulation encompasses the previous Geodesic CNN and Anisotropic CNN.

Finally, the experimental evaluation yields important questions (detailed below).

### Questions
Can the theoretical framework be strengthened by reformulating it in terms of distributions and extended to the class of test functions?

The network architecture used in the experiments uses angular max pooling. Can the authors clarify why this is needed?
Isn't it a step backwards compared to the work of Monti, or other mesh CNNs such as FeastNet that do not require angular max pooling?

How did the authors choose the priors compared against the Dirac prior?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes unifying the intrinsic spatial convolution on manifolds from Bronstein et al 2021 with the spatial convolution and patch operators in Monti et al 2017. The authors show that there is an implicit prior by connecting the two formulations and propose a class of intrinsic CNNs with different priors.

### Strengths
The authors describe previous work (Masci et al 2015, Boscaini et al 2016, Monti et al 2017) in detail and provide a good background of the different patch operators.

### Weaknesses
-My primary concern with this paper is that it’s not clear to me why it is called a prior and how using a different prior helps. It simply seems like different instances of the patch operator, akin to the Gaussian in Masci et al. 2015. 

-If the Dirac prior is the most expressive, why should one consider other priors? The results don’t seem to show much difference between the other priors.

-Are the shot descriptors orientation invariant? Does a global gauge exist?

-Why was a gauge-equivariant method such as [1] not considered? It seems very relevant to the proposed method and has the advantage that the output transforms accordingly with the gauge transformations.

### Summary
The authors attempt to make new connections between prior works on convolutions on meshes. They explore a novel parametrization of the convolution operation, and find that it performs worse than the typical parametrization.

### Strengths
- I appreciate the attempt of drawing new connections between prior works.

### Weaknesses
I am afraid I do not understand the point of this work.

Any linear map from a scalar signal $s: M \to \mathbb R$ on a $n$-manifold, to another scalar signal can be represented by a function $w : M \times M \to \mathbb R$, via the integral $(s \star w)(x) = \int\_M w(x, y)s(y)dy$. Typically, for a convolution-style operator, one does not want the parameters to depend on $x$, so one chooses a frame/gauge $\omega$ on the manifold and arrives at the "intrinsic manifold convolution" of def 1 of the manuscript, with a parameter $t: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$.

Monti et al (2017) [4] recognize that the gauge can not be chosen uniquely, so choose $J$ frames apply a convolution on each of choice of frame, with different parameters each. In other words, they choose a parameter function $t : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^J$.
The alternative approach suggested by [2,3] is to be equivariant to the choice of frame, leading to constraints on the parameters (and typically the use of non-scalar features such as vectors).

However, what's done in theorem 1 in the equation of $(s \star t)\_{\Delta \theta, w}(u)$, is very different from any of the above. Instead of computing the output signal at one point by a single integral (over either the manifold or over the tangent plane), the authors compute a convolution as two integrals over the tangent plane.
Also, they use one parameterization $\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$, and another parametrization $\mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$.

The authors appear to suggest that this is similar to what Monti et al (2017) [4] does, but this appears to me as very different. As the authors themselves note in theorem 1, this notation is completely redundant and can be reduced to a single integral. In fact, the equation for $(s \star t)\_{\Delta \theta, w}(u)$ appears to do two convolutions, with different parameters, which should indeed reduce to a single convolution. In the rest of sec 3, the authors make the unsurprising observation that if one of the two convolutions contain a Dirac delta, that convolution is an identity operation, and the double convolution reduces to just the second convolution.

So what's the point of analyzing the double convolution, which no one uses? It's very different from what [4] proposes, so how does it bridge a gap between anything?

In section 5, the authors are considering parametrizations of the double convolution different from the Dirac prior (thus the single convolution) and find that they perform worse. Also, as they involve a double integral, I suspect that they are much slower to compute.

In short, the authors didn't make any new connection between prior works, and proposed a different parametrization of the convolution that performed worse. In case I completely misunderstood the work, I look forward to your clarifications and will reconsider my opinion.

Other points:
- The authors cite [1] for the gauge equivariant convolution. This should be a citation to [2] and also [3] in the context of meshes.
- The authors should compare to [3] in their experiments. Those authors found close to 100% correspondence at 0 geodesic distance for the the FAUST experiment, much better than the numbers reported in the present manuscript.
- It's very confusing to use $w$ (w) and $\omega$ (omega) in the same equation, the first referring to weights and the latter to the gauge. Please choose an alternative notation.

### Confidence

### Summary
The paper builds a connection between a practical implementation of mesh CNN (Monti et al., 2017) to Intrinsic Mesh CNN (Bronstein et al., 2021). By defining a template, Intrinsic Mesh CNN reduces to the mesh CNN defined by Monti et al. with a Dirac prior. The paper later experiments with different choices of priors and show that Dirac prior leads to better results.

### Strengths
- The paper connects a practical model with the theoretical framework of Intrinsic convolution on meshes.
- The intuition behind the idea is straightforward and easy to understand.
- The paper proves that a partial order exists for comparing these priors.
- The paper shows some quantitative results to compare the difference between different priors.

### Weaknesses
- Although by defining priors the paper builds a connection between theory and practice, the resulted model is not that useful. In particular, the Dirac prior, which corresponds to Monti et al., 2017, is still the best solution at least in the experiments in the paper.
- Indeed, instead of decoupling $w_t(\cdot)$ (the  into $w(\cdot)$ (the prior) and $t(\cdot)$ (the template) and learning the template, one may simply treat $w_t(\cdot)$ as the learnable parameter. If we are allowed to discretize $w_t(\cdot)$ with sufficient amount of parameters, parametering $w_t$ is flexible enough. Making a (not quite accurate) analogy to regular Euclidean CNNs: it seems to me what the paper presents is to pre-convolve some handcrafted $H$ with the original convolutional kernel $K$, with $H$ being something very restrictive in the sense of both capacity and optimization. It therefore does not surprise me too much that the Dirac prior (equivalent to directly parametering $w_t$) is better than all other variants.
- Continuing the point above, I believe there is no reason not to learn the priors at the same time. And doing this may lead to some additional benefits in optimization.
- The presentation seems a bit messy in the experiment section. Many descriptions can be simplified: for instance, I do not think one needs to write down the exact formula of cross entropy (I guess it is well known by the majority of the audience).
- The benchmark seems to be quite toy. I feel that if the paper includes empirical results on the tasks presented by MeshCNN, it will be much more convincing.

### Questions
- How much time does the propose implementation with non-Dirac priors consume, compared to Monti et al., 2017?
- How much difference does it make to change the hyperparameters, including the ones for the GPC coordinate systems and template discretization, in Table 1?
