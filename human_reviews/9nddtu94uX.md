## Abstract
The unparalleled performance of closed-sourced ChatGPT has sparked efforts towards its democratization, with notable strides made by leveraging real user and ChatGPT conversations, as evidenced by Vicuna. However, due to challenges in gathering conversations involving human participation, current endeavors like Baize and UltraChat aim to automatically generate conversational data. They primarily rely on ChatGPT conducting roleplay to simulate human behaviors based on instructions rather than genuine learning from humans, resulting in limited scope, diminished diversity, and an absence of genuine multi-round conversational dynamics. To address the above issues, we target human questions extracted from genuine human-machine conversations as a learning goal and train a user simulator called Socratic to produce a high-quality human-centric synthetic conversation dataset. Subsequently, this dataset was used to train our assistant model, named PlatoLM. PlatoLM achieves the SOTA performance among 7B  models (including  LLaMA-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B) in both Vicuna-Bench and pairwise comparison in MT-Bench; the effectiveness of PlatoLM is also evidenced by manual evaluation.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method to train large language models (LLMs) using a trainable user simulator called "Socratic" to synthesize high-quality conversational data.

- Authors train a "Socratic" model on human questions from ShareGPT to mimic the questioning skills of real users. Socratic Can have free conversations or conversations which start from seeded example questions.
- Authors generate dataset "SocraticChat" via conversations between Socratic and ChatGPT. 
- Authors fine-tuned PlatoLM (like Plato) on SocraticChat as the system agent. 
- Authors performed some analysis on the quality of the fine-tuned PlatoLM and the generated dataset SocraticChat.

### Strengths
The paper has a clean presentation, and it's easy to follow the authors' ideas.

### Weaknesses
- **Problem Motivation:** The goal of the current work is to make it easier and cheaper to produce synthetic dialogues for fine-tuning language models for chat applications. The specific approach here is to replace the human side with an LM trained on human queries. This trained LM then interacts with ChatGPT to bootstrap more data. While the approach can produce interesting artifacts such as the dialogue dataset, I don't think the research goal -- making bootstrapping data from ChatGPT easier -- is a scientific problem. 
- **Performance**: After reading the paper, it's unclear to me whether there are real gains from first training a human query simulator and then using its simulated data. For instance, in Table 2 with the same number of examples, PlatoLM-7b doesn't outperform Vicuna-7B with 10k examples for MT-bench. 
- **Understanding**: After reading the analysis section (Sec 5), it's still unclear to me that if there's a benefit from using Socratic simulated data, what would be an intuitive reason for that? I can imagine the technique useful when the number of total human queries is small, where fine-tuning on human queries helps the query model learn the style. The pretrained base has a lot of knowledge; thus the fine-tuned query model can produce much more diverse query content. But small human data setting is not explored.

I read the author response and have updated my score.

### Questions
For vicuna-7b, authors should clarify the exact version, i.e., is it v1.3 or v1.1, or something else.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach where they train a user simulator called 'Socratic' using real user data. They use 'Socratic' to generate synthetic user-system conversation data when interacting with ChatGPT. The resulting dataset is then used to train their system model, PlatoLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other models, including Vicuna and UltraLaMA, in both Vicuna-Bench and pairwise comparisons in MT-Bench evaluations. This method shows promise for enhancing the quality and diversity of end-to-end models trained for conversational systems.

### Strengths
- Using Real User-System Data: The paper's approach of training the user simulator 'Socratic' with real user-system data is one of its strength. This approach ensures that the generated synthetic conversation data is grounded in actual human interactions, contributing to the effectiveness of the dataset and, by extension, the performance of PlatoLM.

- Thorough Experimental Evaluation: The paper's experimental evaluation is comprehensive, encompassing both automatic and manual assessments. The inclusion of manual evaluation provides a more nuanced understanding of the model's capabilities, as it incorporates human judgments.

- Promising Evaluation Results: Authors report promising results in the automatic and manual evaluations, with PlatoLM outperforming other models in the Vicuna-Bench and pairwise comparisons in MT-Bench. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their Socratic-based synthetic dataset when fine-tuning a system agent model.

### Weaknesses
- Limitations in Domain Transfer: The paper acknowledges limitations when transferring 'Socratic' to new domains. Specifically, it uses a seeding mechanism for domain transfer, which may not be the most flexible or scalable approach. The transferability of 'Socratic' could potentially be improved by instructing it through prompts or other means, making it more adaptable to new domains.

-  Narrow Focus on Backbone Architectures: The paper primarily focuses on performance of PlatoLM with LLaMA backbone, but it does not explore how PlatoLM's performance might vary with different backbone architectures. Examining how PlatoLM performs with various backbone architectures could provide valuable insights into their synthetic dataset generation effectiveness when training models with different backbone architectures.

### Questions
1. Could a fine-tuned GPT-3.5(4)-based model enhance 'Socratic' as the user simulator? Have you considered the possibility of using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model as the user simulator? This approach may potentially improve the diversity of generated dataset and result into a more generalizable PlatoLM.

2. Is 'Socratic' suitable as a prompt/policy generator for a ChatGPT-based user simulators? Exploring this avenue may lead to more flexible and generalized user simulator.

### Summary
This paper proposed to train a user simulator called "Socratic" using genuine human-machine conversations from ShareGPT to produce a high-quality human-centric synthetic conversation dataset. This dataset is then used to train a dialogue agent named "PlatoLM", which achieves the SOTA performance among 7B models.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and clear. The authors have provided sufficient details about their approach, making it easy for others to understand and replicate their work.

2. The authors have conducted extensive experiments to validate their approach. The results show that their assistant model, PlatoLM, outperforms several baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B models on MT-Bench.

3. The authors will release the code and dataset, which is beneficial to build a more powerful dialogue agent.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some doubts about the validity of the method in this paper. It's not clear where the performance improvement comes from. Please refer to the "Questions" for details.

2. Some writing issues. 

   (1) The experimental results in Appendix F are not mentioned in the main text.

   (2) The direction of the quotation marks at the top of page 2.

### Questions
1. Scalability: Is there a performance bar for sample increasing? Table 2 uses 50K data, but the scaling in Figure 4 only achieves 30K, can you explain the reason for doing this? In addition, can more data maintain the effect of Scaling?

2. The experimental results in Appendix F are not mentioned in the main text, which happens to be an interesting experiment. In this regard, I have the following questions:

   (1) Are there any qualitative performance trends for user simulator and assistant model using the same or different backbone? For example, different backbones have a better performance than the same backbones.

   (2) The "overly clever LLaMA-2 backbone" mentioned in Appendix F needs to be further proved by using the LLaMA-1-13B model.

   (3) Will there be better results when the user simulator is more complex than the assistant model? For example, use LLaMA-2 as the user simulator and LLaMA-1 as the assistant model.

   (4) Will there be better results when the user simulator is used as the initialization checkpoint of the assistant model?

3. How does the performance of using Vicuna as the backbone of user simulator and assistant model? This means that we don't need to train an additional user simulator.

4. Is the difference between the middle and right subgraphs in Figure 1 only the user simulator? Is the way the dataset is generated the same?

5. Would this framework still work on a dataset generated by a stronger model, eg. alpaca-gpt4?

### Summary
This paper proposes using a trained language model rather than a general-purpose language model as a user simulator to generate a synthetic conversation dataset. The dataset is then used to train pre-trained language models. The authors train an assistant model called PlatoLM on the synthetic conversation data generated by the trained user simulator. They show that PlatoLM outperforms models trained on synthetic conversations produced by a general-purpose language model.

### Strengths
1. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of training a user simulator model for generating synthetic training data to improve language models. The approach of training a user simulator could be broadly applied across domains when curating datasets to train language models.
2. The comprehensive experiments present promising results when training language models with synthetic conversation datasets produced by the proposed approach of using a trained user simulator model. The trained models outperform those trained on synthetic data generated by a general-purpose language model.
3. The authors curate a high-quality, human-like multi-turn conversation dataset using the trained user simulator model. The dataset will be open-sourced.

### Weaknesses
The proposed approach of training a user simulator model to generate synthetic training data, while logical, may lack sufficient novelty. Using a trained language model as a user simulator aligns with prior work on conversational agents and data augmentation. The straightforward nature of training a user simulator model makes the technique intuitive, but also means the work is incremental.

### Questions
1. In section 5.3, what could be the possible reason for the unstable performance increase when scaling up training samples
2. A minor typo in section 3.2.1, ChaTGPT should be ChatGPT
