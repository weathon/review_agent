## Abstract
Data contamination, i.e., the presence of test data from downstream tasks in the training data of large language models (LLMs), is a potential major issue in measuring LLMs' real effectiveness on other tasks. We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination at the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses wider contamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ "guided instruction:" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the completions from guided instruction compared to a "general instruction" that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learning prompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of the corresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human experts. Further, our findings indicate that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a method for assessing data contamination in models by prompting the model to complete instances of a given dataset. The generated responses are evaluated using either overlap (via ROUGE-L / BLEURT) differences between prompts with/without the dataset specification, or a GPT-4 based few-shot classifier. The instance level information is then used to decide on the partition (train/test/val) / dataset level.

### Strengths
- The method can be applied to black-box models hidden behind an API with little model interaction.
- The study of data contamination, particularly with respect to commonly used evaluation datasets, is an important area.
- An attempt is made to validate the method by fine-tuning on a given downstream dataset

### Weaknesses
- The aggregation from instance to partition level seems to be rather ad hoc (contaminated if at least 1 or 2 instances are contaminated); and a proper ablation regarding these hyperparameters is missing.
- Experiments are performed only with black-box models; using open models with known training details would have supported a more reliable evaluation, since (more of) their training details are known.
- The comparison of Alg. 2 (GPT-4 ICL) with human judgments seems to be rather biased, since the same human annotators created the ICL examples.

### Questions
- The first paragraph of Section 3.1.1 is quite confusing: the text makes it difficult to understand which components it refers to.
- Given your observations in Section 5, (3) that the `ChatGPT-Cheat` method fails due to GPT-4's safeguards being triggered when trying to retrieve examples from these datasets, I wonder how these safeguards would also affect the results you get with your prompt templates.
- For unpaired instances, a random-length prefix is displayed in the prompt; how is this random length sampled? And what is its effect?
- (minor comment): typo: page 2, first paragraph, last sentence: "obtains"  -> "obtained"

### Summary
The paper offers a fresh perspective on assessing the capabilities of LLMs in terms of potential dataset contamination. The authors introduce two novel methodologies to measure these aspects. The first method uses BLEURT and ROUGE-L evaluation metrics, while the second leverages GPT-4's few-shot in-context learning prompt. A significant part of the evaluation revolves around identifying potential data contamination issues, and the results are compared against a baseline method, ChatGPT-Cheat. The findings underscore the nuances and intricacies in effectively evaluating LLMs and the paper serves as a guide to understand their limitations and potential.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper offers a fresh perspective on assessing the capabilities of LLMs in terms of potential dataset contamination. The methodologies introduced, especially the use of GPT-4's few-shot in-context learning, is innovative.
Quality: The research appears thorough with detailed evaluations using two different algorithms. The results are well-tabulated, and the comparison with ChatGPT-Cheat offers a clearer understanding of the proposed methods' effectiveness.
Clarity: The paper is structured coherently, and the methodologies, evaluations, and results are presented in a clear and organized manner, making it easier for the reader to follow.
Significance: Given the increasing utilization and reliance on LLMs in various applications, understanding their limitations and behaviors is crucial. This paper addresses this need, making it a significant contribution to the field.

### Weaknesses
Scope: The paper focuses primarily on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. A broader range of LLMs could provide more generalizable insights.

### Questions
How do the proposed methods scale when evaluating even larger LLMs or when considering different architectures beyond GPT?
Could the authors provide insights into the trade-offs between the two algorithms, especially in terms of computational cost and reliability?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a method to detect dataset leakage/contamination in LLMs first at the instance level before they bootstrap to the partition (test, valid, train). At the instance level, they do so via a guided prompt that was crafted to bias the model towards outputting data in a format that is likely to overlap with the dataset example. Once a candidate dataset and partition is flagged, the authors mark it as leaked if either the overlap between reference instances is statistically significantly higher when using guided peompts compared to general prompts or is determined to be an exact or near match using a GPT-4 based classifier. The best classification models match with 92-100% accuracy the labels provided by human experts.

### Strengths
- Intuitive guided and general prompts to detect instance level contamination.
- Approximating human expert classification for exact and approximate match using GPT-4 as a classifier, i.e. approximating semantic match.
- Validation on a known contaminated LLM.

### Weaknesses
- The authors rely on the algorithm to begin with when deciding what partitions were not leaked and should be added during fine-tuning. This has a circular dependence/assumption. (This point was addressed during discussion with the authors as a writing/explanation issue rather than a true circular dependence).
- Different levels of data leakage is not considered. For example, would GPT-4 be detected as having seen paritions of datasets that follow well-known formats seen from other datasets if it sees only a metadata description of a new dataset? (This limitation is now acknowledged in a footnote with additional details on metrics as well as below in the discussion with the authors).

### Questions
My main question/concern is on the reliability of the instance level contamination detection. Specifically, if a dataset follows a well-known and observed in other dataset format, if a model such as GPT-4 sees the dataset description and meta-data, would it generate sufficiently many near matches to appear as contaminated with a new dataset, despite observing only metadata?
I understand that this work relaxes the prefix match from Sainz et al., but I wonder if this is likely to generate false signal in models that show an ability to generalise from few examplea and/or metadata.

### Summary
The paper investigates data contamination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this issue, the paper suggests a novel approach where a random-length initial segment of the data instance is used as a prompt, along with information about the dataset name and partition type. The paper then assesses data contamination based on the LLM's output. This evaluation can be done by measuring the surface-level overlap with the reference instance or by leveraging GPT-4's few-shot prediction capabilities.
Based on the results, the paper suggests that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets.

### Strengths
The proposed method is straightforward and adaptable to a wide range of datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. I have concerns regarding the soundness of the paper's evaluation methodology.
The proposed method hinges on the assumption that a data instance is contaminated in an LLM if the LLM can complete the instance based on its prefix. The paper's evaluation primarily revolves around how well the proposed methods are compared to human experts under this assumption However, these concerns raise doubts about whether the underlying assumption holds for several reasons.
(1) The inability of an LLM to complete a reference does not necessarily imply that the instance was not used during training. It could be attributed to model forgetting or the model's failure to memorize surface-level features while still having learned the semantic-level features of the data instance. This could lead to a high false negative rate in the evaluation.
(2) An LLM may have encountered the input of a data instance without having seen the actual data instance itself. For instance, in sentiment classification tasks, text can be included in the LLM's training set as long as its label is not provided alongside the text. The ability to complete the input text does not necessarily indicate data contamination in LLMs, potentially resulting in a high false positive rate.
(3) The unavailability of training data details for ChatGPT and GPT-4 due to their proprietary nature prevents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. The current evaluation primarily focuses on how closely the proposed model aligns with human guess about data contamination, in cases where the actual training data is undisclosed. It seems essential to assess the method on models with publicly accessible training data, such as OpenLlama.
2. There's a potential fairness issue in using GPT-4 to evaluate the prediction from itself.
