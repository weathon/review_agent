# Time Fairness in Online Knapsack Problems

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
The online knapsack problem is a classic problem in the field of online algorithms. Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric.  We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments.

### Summary
The authors study time fairness in online knapsack problems (OKPs). Since time-independent fairness is not achievable in OKP, they study the theoretical trade off between competitiveness and fairness with the notion of alpha-conditional time-independent fairness (alpha-CTIF). Several deterministic and randomized algorithms (including some proposed by the authors) are discussed. Numerical experiments comparing these algorithms are conducted on three OKP instances.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and the results are technically sound. The notion of alpha-CTIF is new. In the deterministic case, both a lower bound on the achievable competitive ratio and an alpha-CTIF online deterministic algorithm achieving this lower bound are given.

### Weaknesses
1. The definition of alpha-CTIF does not come naturally to me. Since this definition is new, I would appreciate more motivation behind its use.
2. Numerical experiments are conducted on a limited number of instances, and therefore not very informative.

### Questions
The authors mention that the notion of alpha-CTIF can be potentially adaptable to other online problems. How should one genearlize this notion to other problems? Can they give some examples?

### Summary
This paper considers a variant of the online knapsack problem in which items arrive online, and the algorithm does not know the weight and value of the item before it arrives. Upon each arrival, the algorithm must make an irrevocable decision to either accept or reject the item. The goal is to accept a set of items such that (1) the total weight of the accepted item does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack; (2) the total value of the accepted items is maximized. By observing that the algorithm for the online knapsack problem may not be fair for each item, the authors include a fairness constraint to the problem, which leads to a new variant of the problem.
The main contribution is a fairness notation, and they show that such a fairness notation is too strong to admit a bounded competitive algorithm. They then relax the constraint and propose a deterministic algorithm that is Pareto optimal on fairness and efficiency. In addition, the authors also consider the learning-augmented algorithms. This work also includes some numerical experiments.

### Strengths
1.The studied problem is generally well-motivated, i.e., it aims to include the fairness constraint to the online knapsack problem. The motivation is clear, although I think the example given in the paper is not convincing. See the weakness below.
2.The paper is solidly technical. Although the basic idea of the algorithm comes from the classical threshold algorithm of OKP, the proposed algorithm contains sufficient new ideas and analysis.
3.The results included in the paper are rich. The authors provide a lower bound for the studied problem. In addition, the authors show that randomness can further improve the ratio. Furthermore, the learning-augmented algorithm is also considered in the paper.

### Weaknesses
1.The main weakness is that the motivation of the definition of \alpha-CTIF is not clear. I agree that \alpha-CTIF is a well-defined definition. I have taken a quick look at the proof of Theorem 4.3, and I also understand that such a definition plays an important role in the analysis. But the practical meaning of such a relaxation is not clear. For example, when \alpha=0 or epsilon, what does \alpha-CTIF stand for? This part is important since the main purpose of the work is to make the OKP’s algorithm fair. Thus, finding a suitable fairness notion is critical.
2.It seems that the authors try to claim that fairness is important in the online knapsack problem by Example 1.1. But Example 1.1 is just a typical example of the online knapsack problem, and it does not reflect the importance of fairness. One may need to find another example to convince people about the importance of fairness.

### Summary
This paper studies the online knapsack problem (OKP) from the perspective of fairness. In particular, the authors are interested in competitive algorithms that don’t discriminate items based on when they appear in the sequence of observed items. First, they formalize the notion of time fairness. Second, they observe that previous OKP algorithms with good competitive ratios are not time-fair. Third, they show that randomization can be used to reach Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness and competitiveness. Pareto optimality here, means that neither measure can be increased without decreasing the other. Fourth, they run empirical experiments, which show poor performance of the randomized algorithm. The authors liken this to the results of Reineke in 2014, where similarly poor empirical performance was observed on theoretically strong randomized algorithms for caching.  Fifth, they show that learning-augmented algorithms can be used to improve both fairness and competitiveness. Finally, they show the superior experimental performance of the learning-augmented algorithms.

### Strengths
Originality: Online knapsack is well studied, but this paper is the first to study the fairness aspect of the problem under adversarial sequences.

Result Quality: The investigation is thorough. The authors combine ideas from mathematics, economics, and experimentation effectively to produce nice theoretical contributions that are driven farther and validated by experimentation.  

Writing Quality / Clarity: I am a non-expert in this field. I found the paper well-written. I was especially pleased with the clear introduction.

Significance: The result is a good quality contribution for ICLR.

### Weaknesses
Originality:  If I understand correctly, there are previous papers that study fairness in OKP when the sequence is not adversarial. Not necessarily a weakness of this paper, but an observation that is relevant about the originality of the study.

Significance: Like most papers at ICLR, this paper is probably of interest to a small subcommunity at the conference. I believe this is true of most papers at the conference, so it is not a negative comment towards a paper.

### Questions
Are there any Pareto-optimality claims to be made about the learning-augmented algorithms that you describe in the later part of the paper?
