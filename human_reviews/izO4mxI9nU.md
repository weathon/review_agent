## Abstract
The intricate dynamics of human-AI collaboration presents an ongoing chal- lenge. While recent research incorporates human behaviors into machine learn- ing model design, most utilise single global confusion matrix or human behavior model, disregarding potential personalization to user. To address this gap, we propose HAICO-CN, a human-AI collaborative method that enhances human-AI joint decision-making by training personalized models using a novel cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique. During training, HAICO-CN first identifies and clusters noise label patterns within the multi-rater data sets, followed by a cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation method that generates enough data to train a collaborative human-AI model for each cluster. During inference, the user fol- lows an onboarding process, allowing HAICO-CN to select a cluster-wise human- AI model based on the user’s noisy label patterns, thereby enhancing human-AI joint decision-making performance. HAICO-CN is simple to implement, model- agnostic, and effective. We propose new evaluation criteria for assessing human- AI collaborative methods and empirically evaluate HAICO-CN across diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10N, CIFAR-10H, Fashion-MNIST-H, and Chaoyang histopathology, demonstrating HAICO-CN’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art human-AI collaboration approaches.

### Summary
- To address this gap between the AI models and humans, the authors propose a human-AI collaborative method referred to as HAICO-CN that enhances human-AI joint decision-making by training personalized models using a novel cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique.
- During training, HAICO-CN first identifies and clusters noise label patterns within the multi-rater data sets, followed by a cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation method that generates enough data to train a collaborative human-AI model for each cluster.
- During inference, the user follows an onboarding process, allowing HAICO-CN to select a cluster-wise human-AI model based on the user’s noisy label patterns, thereby enhancing human-AI joint decision-making performance.
- The author also proposes new evaluation criteria for assessing human-AI collaborative methods and empirically evaluate HAICO-CN across diverse datasets to validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
(+) The proposed HAICO-CN is a human-AI collaborative ensemble method that enhances human-AI joint decision-making by training personalized models using a novel cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique.

### Weaknesses
- (-) The proposed method uses a noisy-label augmentation technique. However, there are no interpretations of noise level and its performances.
- (-) The model could work on user clusters that are sensitive to user bias. The user cluster selection would lead to leaking group information.

### Questions
- How about the cluster-wise final performances? Some cluster-wise performance plots would help understand the HAICO-CN and the role of clusters.
- What makes the model robust to noise? To show the robustness, additional interpretation would be needed using input perturbation.
- The performances seem to depend on cluster bias—an additional interpretation of clusters such as an ensemble of clusters and individual cluster-wise performances.

## Human Reviewer 2

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Proposes HAICO-CN, a human-AI collaboration algorithm that trains personalized noisy-label correction models to enhance collaborative decision-making. Specifically, it first clusters user noise label patterns, and then onboards a user to assign them to a cluster. Then the cluster-specific model is used to combine and refine the human and model predicted label. Results are presented using several multi-rater datasets, demonstrating improvements over baselines.

### Strengths
– The problem setting is interesting and of real-world importance

– The proposed method is simple, intuitive, and appears highly effective while being reasonably efficient

– The paper does a good job of reviewing and comparing to prior work

– The set of metrics defined are useful, and the experimental results are comprehensive

### Weaknesses
– While the paper considers its experiments on CIFAR-10N, Fashion-MNIST-H, and Chaoyang as “real-world”, I’m not entirely convinced that is appropriate since even for these, it simulates a test set for each new user by estimating a noise transition matrix. I agree that the CIFAR10N to CIFAR10H is more  “close to the real world” as the paper acknowledges – I would recommend an expanded discussion of the actual realism of the experimental setup, including the underlying assumptions, and cases wherein these may not hold. 

– Unless I missed it, the paper lacks a few important ablations eg. what is performance without performing noisy label augmentation?

– The paper does not provide a principled way to select the number of clusters K. It claims that fuzzy K-Means is robust to this, but this claim is not validated. In the paper’s real-world experiments, K=3 simply works well because of a reduction in the number of users/cluster to train a cluster-specific model, which is simply an artifact of the experimental design. It would be helpful to see i) what K values work well with more data ii) what a principled way to select K might be, and if Fuzzy KMeans is indeed robust to this choice.

– I found the presentation of the approach rather complex and difficult to follow. For instance, Eq. 2 presents a complex per-user feature vector construction strategy without any particular justification/intuition. Similarly, it would be helpful to summarize the intuition behind the crowdlab consensus labeling strategy employed in Eq. 1. 

– The paper would be strengthened by a deeper analysis of the noisy label patterns learned for the real-world data – while the results presented in Fig 5 are helpful, it would be nice to qualitative visualize examples of some of the labeling biases identified by the user clustering and corrected by the algorithm.

– It would be interesting to also discuss the applicability of the proposed method to settings beyond multiclass classification eg. would a similar method be applicable in a multilabel setting, where each image has multiple possible latent labels?

### Summary
The paper introduces HAICO-CN, a human-AI collaborative method aimed at enhancing joint decision-making by personalizing models to individual user noise patterns. Utilizing a cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique, HAICO-CN trains models tailored to specific user groups identified within multi-rater datasets. The method's effectiveness is validated empirically across different datasets, outperforming current human-AI collaboration approaches.

### Strengths
1. **Targets on an interesting problem**:
The author chooses to focus on an important issue. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, human-machine collaboration becomes critical and may have many applications.

2. **Focus on Personalization**: The authors' approach to personalizing AI models to individual users is a significant strength of the paper. Personalization is key to the next generation of AI tools, and the authors' work targets how this can be achieved in the context of noisy data and decision-making.

3. **Simplicity and Effectiveness of the Proposed Method**: The simplicity and intuitiveness of the HAICO-CN method are notable strengths. The authors have developed a technique that does not rely on overly complex algorithms or require extensive computational resources, which enhances its accessibility and potential for widespread adoption. 

4. **Quality of Writing**: The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand. The authors have structured their arguments logically, making the paper accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise in the field.

### Weaknesses
1. **Insufficient Experiments for Comparative Analysis**:
   The paper could be strengthened by including a more comprehensive set of experiments that compare HAICO-CN with popular baselines known for their effectiveness in learning with noisy labels For example, DivideMix (ICLR20), ELR (NeurIPS20), CausalNL (NeurIPS21), C2D (WACV23), and UNICON (CVPR22). The absence of such comparisons may lead to questions about the thoroughness of the evaluation and the generalizability of the proposed method across different noisy label learning scenarios.

2. **Lack of Comprehensive Review on Learning with Noisy Labels**:
   Given that the paper addresses the challenge of noisy labels, it would be beneficial to include a thorough review of existing methods for learning with noisy labels. This review should cover the spectrum of strategies employed to mitigate the impact of label noise and how these strategies compare to the proposed HAICO-CN method. By situating HAICO-CN within the broader context of the field, the paper would provide readers with a clearer understanding of the novelty and significance of the proposed method. Moreover, such a review could highlight how HAICO-CN contributes to or diverges from established theories and practices in noisy label learning.

3. **Potential Limitations in Technical Contribution**:
   While the paper introduces a novel cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique, its technical contribution may appear limited if it does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing work. For example, the paper could benefit from discussing the recent findings from "Identifiability of Label Noise Transition Matrix" (ICML23), which also employs a cluster-based approach to infer clean labels from noisy ones. 

4. **Reliance on Accurate Clustering of User Noise Patterns**:
   The effectiveness of HAICO-CN is predicated on the precise clustering of users based on their noise patterns. However, this process may be fraught with challenges. Firstly, it is possible that the clustering assumption does not hold. Specifically, even if it is satisfied, it is unknown when the cluster can be identified, and whether the proposed method can successfully identify them.  There is also the concern of temporal dynamics—users' labeling patterns may evolve due to factors such as learning, fatigue, or changes in the task context. If HAICO-CN cannot adapt to these changes, the performance of the personalized models may degrade.

### Questions
- Could the authors elaborate on the decision to exclude certain established baselines for learning with noisy labels such as DivideMix (ICLR20), ELR (NeurIPS20), CausalNL (NeurIPS21), C2D (WACV23), and UNICON (CVPR22) from the comparative analysis?
   - How does the approach of HAICO-CN to handling noisy labels differ from or improve upon these existing methods?
   - Could the authors clarify the novel aspects of HAICO-CN's cluster-wise noisy-label augmentation technique in relation to similar approaches, such as the one presented in "Identifiability of Label Noise Transition Matrix" (ICML23)?
   - What are the unique contributions of HAICO-CN that distinguish it from other cluster-based methods for inferring clean labels from noisy data?
   - How do the authors ensure the accuracy of clustering users based on noise patterns in HAICO-CN?
   - Could the authors discuss the generalizability of HAICO-CN across different domains and types of data beyond the datasets evaluated in the study?
   - How does HAICO-CN account for the temporal dynamics of user behavior, such as learning or fatigue, which might alter their noise patterns?
   - Is there a component of continuous learning or a feedback mechanism in HAICO-CN that allows for the models to be updated in response to evolving user labeling patterns?
