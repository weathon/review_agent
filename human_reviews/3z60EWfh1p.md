## Abstract
Transfer learning is a crucial technique for handling a small amount of data that is potentially related to other abundant data. However, most of the existing methods are focused on classification tasks using images and language datasets. Therefore, in order to expand the transfer learning scheme to regression tasks, we propose a novel transfer technique based on differential geometry, namely the Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder (${\it GATE}$). In this method, we interpret the latent vectors from the model to exist on a Riemannian curved manifold. We find a proper diffeomorphism between pairs of tasks to ensure that every arbitrary point maps to a locally flat coordinate in the overlapping region, allowing the transfer of knowledge from the source to the target data. This also serves as an effective regularizer for the model to behave in extrapolation regions. In this article, we demonstrate that ${\it GATE}$ outperforms conventional methods and exhibits stable behavior in both the latent space and extrapolation regions for various molecular graph datasets.

I would like to thank the authors for the detailed rebuttal.
After reading the rebuttal and other reviewers point, I would like to increase the original score.

### Strengths
- Experiment demonstrates superior performance of GATE in extrapolation tasks, with 14.3% lower error in scaffold split compared to conventional methods.
- This paper shows stable underlying geometry of GATE's latent space and robust behavior in the presence of data corruption.
- This paper provides ablation studies and further analysis to understand the role of distance loss and the stability of the latent space.

### Weaknesses
- The experiments are based on 14 molecular datasets and most counts are limited (largest one contains 73k count, while smallest only has 241). This limits the generalization of such method on other large dataset.
- Lack of analysis on the computational efficiency or scalability of the GATE algorithm.
- The proposed method, in abstract, is an encoder-decoder-based method, which is kind of trivial in the transfer learning setup.

### Questions
- The distance loss is simplified as equation 12, which is basically Euclidean distance. This is contradict to the manifold setup. Can the author discussed more about the distance loss, which seems to be the major difference the author proposed compared with other existing methods.
- The ablation study shows that the problem is an overfitting problem. So it basically means the data is not enough/ early stopping should help. So the real contribution of such method is slightly not distinguishable. 
- Some tiny piece: 
  - 80-20 split of train and test, is not 4-fold cross-validation. 
  - Figure 3 shows GATE as circle, does this mean all equal or it takes GATE as reference?

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of inductive transfer learning in regression tasks. Assuming that the latent vectors of the model lie on a smooth Riemannian manifold, the paper suggests that for effective transfer learning, source and target tasks need to be mapped to regions with large overlap. The paper describes how diffeomorphisms between pairs of tasks can be learned using parametric encoders and decoders, such that individual data points are confined to a locally flat frame in the overlap region. This is a local Euclidean approximation that helps simplify distance calculation when only small perturbations are concerned.

The proposed method (GATE) adds 3 losses to the regression loss: an auto-encoder loss for the choice of diffeomorphism modeling, a consistency loss that pivots points on the overlapping region, a mapping loss that enforces predictions to be preserved through the transforms, and a distance loss that forces distances between pivot points and perturbations to be equal across tasks. The distance loss can be viewed as a regularizer.

The proposed method is evaluated on a transfer learning task for molecular property prediction and is shown to outperform alternatives in a majority of the transfer tasks considered. The overall RMSE is also significantly lower than the baseline methods.

### Strengths
Originality and significance: The Riemannian view of the latent space is likely not new to this work, but two of the loss functions are novel to this work (to the best of my knowledge). The empirical improvement over the baselines in the studied task of molecular property prediction is significant.

Quality and clarity: The paper is overall well motivated. The descriptions are accompanied by formulas and helpful schematic diagrams. The empirical analysis covers several aspects of the proposed solution, including ablation studies to gauge the effect of each part of the loss function.

### Weaknesses
Even though the method is likely applicable and useful in other domains, the paper only studies it on the molecular property prediction task. This significantly cuts into the impact of the paper as the results cannot (in good faith) be extrapolated to a completely different domain of tasks.

With a single model architecture for molecular property prediction as the only domain, a more detailed description is missing from the main body of the paper (e.g. input/output/latent dimensions, range of values, SMILES format, DMPNN layers, etc.). The paper is not self-contained when it comes to model components.

The paper is hard to follow in parts, as the overall picture takes more than 4 pages to be completely laid out. I think an overview of all the losses can be included earlier in the paper to help with the flow and clarity of the paper.

Since the heavy machinery of Riemannian geometry is not really used in the paper (apart from freedom for choice of local coordinates and the overall smoothness assumptions), IMO the elaborate dive into the nuances of dealing with geodesics in an arbitrary metric space is unnecessary, if not needlessly confusing. There is no point introducing the Christoffel symbol just to scare off a reader that might think a nice closed-form solution is possible in the generic case. I’d suggest removing derivations and definitions that do not contribute to the flow of the paper.

### Questions
Notes and questions:
- The typo in equation 7 was particularly hard to resolve while reviewing this paper. The choice of notation might have contributed to this.
- It’s not clear what you mean by "stable characteristics" in section 5.2. Please elaborate on what makes MTL relatively unstable in this case.
- Lower bounds are not shown in Figure 6.

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach to improve multi-task learning by training separate learners for each task but transferring latent representations between them under the assumption that the latent spaces can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds.  This is accomplished by introducing encoders and decoders between the latent spaces of the source and target task, and training by use of the original loss function plus a cycle consistency loss for the encoder-decoder pair for each direction, and a distance loss based on perturbations to the input to ensure that the latent space mapping from source to target preserves the local metric.  The resulting method, GATE, is applied to a set of molecular prediction tasks, and compared to existing methods such as single-task learning, multi-task learning, transfer learning, knowledge distillation, and global structure-preserving knowledge distillation.

### Strengths
This paper proposes an interesting approach to transfer learning, and the contribution of each proposed feature (consistency loss, distance loss) is analyzed in an ablation study.  It is very interesting that the distance loss can prevent overfitting.  The choice of a dataset with 14 different tasks is suitable for a multi-task setup.  The use of two different random splits shows careful consideration of the testing setup.  The graphical check of the latent space across tasks helps builds confidence in the method.  The results are reported in detail in the appendix which allows deeper analysis by interested readers.

### Weaknesses
The idea of enforcing cycle-consistency is not new, and it seems appropriate to cite related literature on cycle-consistency within transfer learning such as CyCADA (Hoffman et al. 2018).

I found it difficult to follow the notation introduced to explain the method given the lack of explanation on the notations.  More details are needed to describe the method precisely.

It is not clear to me how distance loss helps prevent overfitting.  A toy example would help with the intuition.

The fact that only chemistry applications were considered limits the generality of this paper to folks working in other domains.

It is not clear how much the concepts of Riemannianian geometry actually add to the paper (what surprising results or insights depend on deep findings from differential geometry?) but instead seem to obfuscate the relatively simple and intuitive ideas which are implemented in the method GATE.

### Questions
1. What surprising results or insights depend on deep findings from differential geometry?
2. To what degree does GATE succeed at learning a cycle-consistent and metric-preserving map?
3. What are limitations of the method?  Under what conditions would it do worse than conventional multi-task learning?
4. What is X'' in equation (7)?
5. What are the details for how STL, MTL, transfer learning, KD and GSP-KD were trained?
6. Could the fact that distance loss helps prevent overfitting be related to training with adversarial examples?
7. What happens if you only remove the cycle-consistency loss, but not the distance loss?

### Summary
The authors describe a novel formulation of regression transfer learning by embedding the latent space in a Riemannian manifold, allowing the notion of consistency across tasks and the mapping of different points together.

### Strengths
- Novel regularization procedure which also has the potential of being used outside of the scope of this paper.
- Superior performance when compared to other methods for transfer learning.
- Intuitive idea and easy to implement.
- Good experimental section, with a nice exploration of overfitting.

### Weaknesses
- The writing quality needs to be improved, there are both distracting grammar issues and, more importantly, the mathematical formulation of the method and description of the prerequisites for understanding this work have not been adequately presented.
- Section 5.2 is not well-supported, specifically the assertion "Ideally, if a model is well-guided by the right information and regularized properly, the overall geometry of the latent space may remain stable and not depend on the type of source tasks. However, if the target task is overwhelmed by the source task and regularization is not enough, latent space will be heavily deformed according to the source tasks" which needs more detail, or a few corroborating citations.

### Questions
- In Section 5.3, it seems that using the word "significant" when comparing the GATE and MTL results is not precise enough. Can the authors add a statistical test? 
- In the same section, I would also be interested in re-running this experiment with higher deviations, both of the same sign as the original data, just made more extreme (a data point that is 2 sigma away from the mean is made to be 10 sigma away) and the opposite sign (2 sigma more than the mean is changed to 10 sigma less than the mean). Is there a point at which MTL and GATE have more similar performance, or does the gap increase?
- How is this approach connected to contrastive learning and metric learning?
