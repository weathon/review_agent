# Memory-efficient particle filter recurrent neural network for object localization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 1, 8

## Abstract
This study proposes a novel memory-efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specified to solve the object localization problem. This problem is to recover the object states along with its movement in a noisy environment. We take the idea of the classical particle filter and combine it with GRU RNN architecture. The key feature of the resulting memory-efficient particle filter RNN model (mePFRNN) is that it requires the same number of parameters to process environments of different sizes.  Thus, the proposed mePFRNN architecture consumes less memory to store parameters compared to the previously proposed PFRNN model. To demonstrate the performance of our model, we test it on symmetric and noisy environments that are incredibly challenging for filtering algorithms. In our experiments, the mePFRNN model provides more precise localization than the considered competitors and requires fewer trained parameters.

### Summary
This paper seems to have proposed some detailed modifications to the PFRNN framework (particle-filter based RNN).

### Strengths
The performance seems to be marginally better than PFRNN.

### Weaknesses
From what I gathered, the solution the authors provided is to reduce the number of parameters from PFRNN by avoiding the convolutional encoding of the environment factors. The authors argued about that PFRNN’s parameters are proportional to the environment size, however this is true only because PFRNN has a flatten layer which flattens the environment into a long vector. Such a “flatten” approach greatly inflates the number of parameters and have been abandoned in the deep learning community since the inception of ResNet in 2015. Hence, I think this approach ought to make a baseline comparison to the global average pooling approach that has been adopted since ResNet, if not newer transformer-based approaches. If one uses global average pooling instead of flatten, then PFRNN’s # of parameters won’t scale with environment size, and we would have a much more fair comparison between the baseline and the proposed approach.

There are some confusing parts in the comparison to PFRNN too. In eq. (12), the authors presented their approach of encoding the x and y as being novel, however I don’t see a significant difference between that and the paragraph after eq. (9), where we also see PFRNN encoding x and y after 2 linear layers as n and m. Is there a significant difference between this and eq. (12) besides the fact that concatenation is done at a slightly different place?

Besides, there are some other differences such as multiplying some state feature vectors instead of concatenating them, which I don’t think was discussed in enough detail about the motivation and the performance gains it provides. 

Also, I am not convinced, from the standard deviation numbers the authors provided, that this approach is truly better than the baselines. The standard deviations are routinely 3-4 times of the mean, which I believe would lead to any statistical tests to indicate most of the differences shown in the tables to be statistically insignificant.

Other issues:

I don’t agree calling eq. (8) “perturbation with random noise” that seems to be misleading. What eq. (8) really does is just a resampling of the particles with replacement. It would be better to clarify the terminology.

The font size of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are too small to be legible. Besides, the presentation approach of showing huge sets of equations with changes of variable names (between e.g. eq. (11) and eq. (13) and just hoping that the readers will figure out what is different is not a great practice. It would be much easier if the authors delineate clearly what are the differences between eq. (11) and eq. (13).

Overall: 

In general, the authors have not shown sufficient evidence to convince me that this algorithm they proposed is novel enough, or it significantly reduces the number of parameters and the model size, or whether it improves the results or not. I also do not believe this work is well-presented, because of its resolution on having readers to read through long equations. Hence, I cannot argue for this paper’s acceptance at this stage.

### Questions
Please compare with baselines that do not use the flatten approach in the final layer, such as any ResNet-based algorithms or newer transformer-based approaches that employ global average pooling. 

Please clarify the difference between eq. (12) and the paragraph after eq. (9).

Please discuss the motivation of the design choices of multiplying state vectors.

Please discuss the variance in the results.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces a memory-efficient Particle Filter RNN architecture for object localisation. The proposed method builds upon the existing PFRNN work (which itself introduces a modified RNN/GRU cell equipped with particle states and weights), incorporating additional assumptions from classical estimation methods (KFs and PFs).

### Strengths
- Good theoretical development.
- Interesting research direction to blend ideas from classical methods into learning architectures.

### Weaknesses
- Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be much technical novelty of the proposed mePFRNN compared with PFRNN. The main difference is that PFRNN encodes the entire environment as a 2D grid, while mePFRNN does not require this, and operates on motions and states directly. I feel this could be a simple model variant rather than a novel technical contribution that warrants a separate publication.
- The method is evaluated in quite simple grid world environments, in a narrow setting with beacons placed in the environment. The method would be more convincing if applied to larger-scale data or without specific observations relating to beacons or obstacles.

### Questions
- I found the paper quite hard to follow in places. For the introduction, a more linear narrative through each paragraph would be helpful. Eg. first paragraph on the problem to be solved, the second one on existing methods, and third one on the proposed approach leading into the contributions.
- A lot of the citations need to be fixed to use \citep{}; many of them blend into the rest of the text without parentheses.

### Summary
The study introduces an innovative approach to object localization in noisy environments through a new recurrent neural network (RNN) design. By integrating the classical particle filter with the gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN framework, the researchers have developed a memory-efficient particle filter RNN model (mePFRNN). Notably, the mePFRNN boasts an invariant parameter count regardless of the environment size, marking a substantial improvement in memory efficiency over its predecessor, the PFRNN model. The model's effectiveness was evaluated in symmetrical and noisy conditions, where traditional filtering algorithms typically struggle. The findings indicate that the mePFRNN outperforms existing models in accuracy while also requiring fewer parameters to be trained, highlighting its potential for more efficient and precise object localization tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper presents an effective method to tackle the memory bottleneck for large scale object localization problems. 
- Using neural networks to encode the spatial information so that the representation becomes voxel-independent is promising and novel in the context of particle filtering.
- The paper is well written and well formatted. 
- The authors demonstrate certain advantages on reduced memory. It would be useful for robotics that run inference on real time with limited memory constraints. 
- Proper ablation studies have been done and discussed.

### Weaknesses
- The presentation could be improved by providing a better comparison picture side-by-side between the proposed method and the PFRNN method.
- [Minor] Table1 and 2 should add optimal direction (up or down) in each column of the table.

### Questions
Consider the case of real world robot localization. How large would the memory requirement to be? Table1 suggests that the memory requirement for PFRNN is not very much with less number of particles. How much gain would the proposed method gain when scaling up to a larger problem comparing to PFRNN?
