## Abstract
Reconstruction attacks and defenses are essential in understanding the data leakage problem in machine learning. However, prior work has centered around empirical observations of gradient inversion attacks, lacks theoretical groundings, and was unable to disentangle the usefulness of defending methods versus the computational limitation of attacking methods.  In this work, we propose a strong reconstruction attack in the setting of federated learning. The attack reconstructs intermediate features and nicely integrates with and outperforms most of the previous methods. On this stronger attack, we thoroughly investigate both theoretically and empirically the effect of the most common defense methods. Our findings suggest that among various defense mechanisms, such as gradient clipping, dropout, additive noise, local aggregation, etc., gradient pruning emerges as the most effective strategy to defend against state-of-the-art attacks.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new model inversion attack in federated learning (FL) setting. Building upon prior attack methodologies, the proposed approach integrates an additional U-Net for enhanced feature reconstruction. Additionally, the study offers theoretical assurances regarding the performance of data recovery.

### Strengths
- The study problem is significant.
- Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of related works.
    - Notable recent model inversion attacks [1-5], especially those focusing on model/weight modifications, are absent.
    - The literature review also misses out on discussing recent defenses [6-9].

- Unconvincing results.
    - Experiments are limited on CIFAR10 using ResNet18, and the maximum batch size explored is 32. This limited scope is concerning as many robust attack methods have proven efficacy in more challenging settings. Even the two methods considered in this paper for comparison have been demonstrated to work on the more complex ImageNet dataset, utilizing larger networks and batch size exceeding 128.
   - Only two optimization-based attack methods are considered for comparison. A broader comparative study, especially with the latest attack strategies [1-5] like those that modify model architectures, would have added more depth and credibility to the findings.
   - The research could have been enriched by considering and evaluating the effectiveness against recent defenses [6-9] designed to combat model inversion attacks.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the gradient-based data reconstruction attacks (and defenses) in federated learning. The contributions are two-fold: (1) it proposes a new reconstruction attack that is stronger than existing approaches, and (2) it proves a data reconstruction upper bound to help theoretically understand the effect of common defense methods.

### Strengths
1. The empirical analysis in Section 5 provides a comprehensive comparison of the effectiveness of existing data reconstruction approaches.

### Weaknesses
1. The new reconstruction method proposed in this paper is Eq.(2). However, compared with the method in [r1], the only difference of Eq.(2) is that it introduces a new regularization term $\mathcal R_{\mathrm{feature}}(\hat x)$ without explaining why this regularization term can improve the performance of data reconstruction. So I think the novelty of the proposed method is limited.

2. Eq.(5) in Theorem 3.2 is very strange. Specifically, to calculate Eq.(5), one needs to reconstruct a $\hat x_i$ for any given ground truth $x_i$. However, to the best of my knowledge, in data reconstruction attacks it is usually not able to "reconstruct a specific training data" but can only "reconstruct a random data point from the training dataset", unless with some special assumptions. Unfortunately, I do not see such special assumptions in Theorem 3.2. Please comment.

3. One of the main contributions of this paper is the data reconstruction upper-bound proposed in Theorem 3.2. However, similar data reconstruction upper bounds have already been proposed in [r2], an ICML paper in 2022. Compared with Theorem 3.2 in this paper, the results in [r2] seem better in various aspects: (1) the bound in [r2] does not depend on model architectures, while Theorem 3.2 only applies to one-hidden-layer neural networks; and (2) the bound in [r2] does not depend on specific reconstruction algorithms, while Theorem 3.2 only applies to gradient-based reconstruction attacks. So I think the authors need to explain the advantages of Theorem 3.2 compared with [r2].

4. In Section 3.3, before presenting Theorem 3.2, the authors wrote that "We adopt the tensor-based reconstruction method proposed by (Wang et al., 2023)". Does this mean that Theorem 3.2 only applies to such a "tensor-based reconstruction method" but not the new reconstruction method proposed by the authors? If yes, then I think the contribution of this paper will be further shrunk since the proposed new attack (or say empirical results) has no relevance to the theoretical results of this paper.

5. In Section 4.5, the authors explain why gradient pruning is suitable for defending against reconstruction attacks. However, such an explanation is too casual since it is full of intuitive arguments. I think the authors should at least show how gradient pruning could increase the reconstruction upper bound in Theorem 3.2 to justify their claim.

### Questions
1. What does the term $y$ in Eq.(2) mean? Is it a randomly chosen label value?

2. In Eq.(3) in Section 3.2, what do the terms $\phi$ and $\hat z$ mean? The authors did not explain this in Section 3.2, which makes the whole subsection very difficult to follow.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new gradient inversion attack using an untrained U-Net as image prior and feature matching. Authors give recovery error bound of recovering features of the first linear layer. For each of gradient leakage defenses of local aggregation, DPSGD, secure aggregation, dropout and gradient pruning, the authors provide reconstruction error bound of their methods.

### Strengths
1. The primary contribution of the paper lies in expanding the recovery error bounds for the two-layer MLP gradient inversion problem to the situations with various gradient leakage defense mechanisms.

2. Employing the deep image prior and utilizing an untrained U-Net as an image prior is intriguing.

3. The writing is of high quality, with clear explanations of all terms, devoid of any ambiguity.

### Weaknesses
1. The methodologies employed in this paper are not technically novel. Tensor-based reconstruction methods were previously proposed in [1], and the effectiveness of optimizing generator parameters (in this study, U-Net parameters) instead of the original image space was demonstrated in previous gradient leakage research [2].

2. The paper dedicates a significant portion to error bounds analysis, primarily focusing on reconstructing input for a two-layer MLP, which addresses the feature reconstruction aspect. However, the experiments are conducted using a ResNet-18 network, which is substantially more complex than a two-layer MLP. This raises doubts about the relevance of these error bounds in the context of deeper and more intricate neural networks, which may easily violate the assumptions (e.g., 1-Lipschitzness). Additionally, the defense methods are applied to gradients across the entire network, not exclusively to the final linear layers. As a result, error bounds analysis specific to defenses for only the final fully-connected layers may not provide meaningful insights.

3. The experimental setup does not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of this work. 
   (2.1) Authors only report their attack results on a limited subset of 50 CIFAR-10 images, without disclosing the criteria used for selecting these 50 images, which could introduce bias.
   (2.2) To facilitate feature reconstruction, the authors introduce an additional linear layer into the ResNet-18 architecture, which may appear artificial. In practical scenarios, federated learning participants might question the adoption of such an unusual architectural modification due to its dubious nature.

4. Conflict information: In Appendix D, the second paragraph states that the victim network is a ResNet-18 trained for only one epoch; however, in the third paragraph, it is mentioned that the ResNet-18 was trained for 200 epochs.

### Questions
1. Are the reconstruction results sensitive to the initializations of U-Net parameters or Gaussian noise z? Is there high variance in the results when randomly reconstructing the sample batch multiple times? It would be beneficial to include additional experiments to investigate this aspect further.

2. A substantial portion of the paper emphasizes that "feature reconstruction error using [Wang 2023] is bounded even in the presence of gradient leakage defenses." Table 2 also demonstrates the accuracy of feature reconstruction. However, the main paper lacks a strong indication of whether feature reconstruction significantly enhances gradient inversion. It would be helpful to clarify whether the improvement in attack performance is primarily due to U-Net optimization or feature reconstruction. Can you quantify the performance gain achieved through U-Net optimization compared to pixel space optimization?

I want to express my appreciation to the authors for submitting this work. I am excited to see theoretical analysis addressing the gradient leakage problem, which has been relatively underexplored in this area. I believe that theoretical analysis can provide deeper insights into understanding the gradient leakage problem. I am open to reconsidering my evaluation score if the authors can effectively address the concerns and questions raised above.
I am willing to raise my score, if the authors can address my above concerns and questions well.
