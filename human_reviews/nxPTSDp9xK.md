- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Recent vision-language models have achieved tremendous progress far beyond what we ever expected. However, their computational costs are also dramatically growing with rapid development, especially for the large models. It makes model acceleration exceedingly critical in a scenario of limited resources. Although extensively studied for unimodal models, the acceleration for multimodal models, especially the vision-language Transformers, is relatively under-explored.  To pursue more efficient and accessible vision-language Transformers, this paper introduces \textbf{Cross}-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{T}okens (\textbf{\emph{CrossGET}}), a universal acceleration framework for vision-language Transformers. This framework adaptively combines tokens through real-time, cross-modal guidance, thereby achieving substantial acceleration while keeping high performance. \textit{CrossGET} has two key innovations: 1) \textit{Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble}. \textit{CrossGET} incorporates cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble to exploit cross-modal information effectively, only introducing cross-modal tokens with negligible extra parameters. 2) \textit{Complete-Graph Soft Matching}. In contrast to the existing bipartite soft matching approach, \textit{CrossGET} introduces a complete-graph soft matching policy to achieve more reliable token-matching results while maintaining parallelizability and high efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted on various vision-language tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, image captioning, and visual question answering. Performance on both classic multimodal architectures and emerging multimodal LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed \textit{CrossGET} framework. The code and models will be made public.

### Summary
The paper introduces the Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens (CrossGET), which is designed to enhance the efficiency of vision-language Transformers. It tackles the significant challenge of mitigating the computational costs and latency associated with vision-language models. Within this framework, two essential components come into play: Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble, orchestrating the fusion of tokens guided by cross-modal cues, and Complete-Graph Soft Matching, contributing to the refinement of token matching outcomes.

### Strengths
1.Comprehensive Experimentation and Solid Theoretical Foundation: The paper's strength lies in its extensive and well-documented experiments, combined with a rigorous theoretical underpinning for the proposed method. This makes the work sound and reliable, both in terms of its theoretical framework and practical applicability.
2. Relevance of the Addressed Problem: The choice of the problem addressed in the paper holds significant value, especially in the context of the substantial computational overhead associated with many state-of-the-art multimodal models. This highlights the practical importance of the research. However, it is recommended that the authors extend their analysis and experimentation to encompass a broader range of models, moving beyond the initial exploration with BLIP-2. This would further enhance the paper's contribution and generalizability.

### Weaknesses
1. Cross-Modal Guidance Utilization: In the paper, the emphasis is placed on the ability of CrossGET to be applied to modality-dependent models like BLIP and BLIP2. The approach involves learning a cross-token to serve as guidance for another modality. However, there are concerns about this approach. Taking BLIP as an example, it appears that it may not fully harness textual guidance. In scenarios like visual grounding, where different textual descriptions highlight various aspects of the same image, it raises questions about how CrossGET selects tokens from different texts to focus on.
2. Unfair Experimental Comparisons: The paper contains instances of unfair comparisons in the experiments. For example, in section 4.1, the authors directly compare retrieval results of models such as TRIPS and UPOP. Yet, these models vary significantly in terms of training data and model parameter sizes, making the comparison less meaningful. To provide a clearer perspective, the paper should emphasize how much TRIPS, or similar acceleration methods, improve over the baseline, and how much the proposed method accelerates and enhances performance compared to the baseline.
3. Limited Model Performance Improvement: The paper reports only marginal improvements in model performance while introducing a relatively complex method. Moreover, the acceleration achieved by the proposed method appears similar to that of ToMe. Given the relative complexity of the proposed approach, the effectiveness of this work may be questioned, especially if the gains in performance and acceleration are not substantial.

### Questions
1. Implementation of Token Reduction in BLIP-2: It would be beneficial for the authors to provide more detailed information on how they specifically implemented token reduction in BLIP-2 within the context of their method. A more elaborate explanation of the process and its impact on BLIP-2's performance would enhance the clarity and completeness of the paper.
2. Impact of CrossGET on OPT in BLIP-2: A notable aspect of this work is the introduction of CrossGET into the frozen OPT component of BLIP-2 for token reduction. However, it's important to consider that OPT is a decoder-only model. The paper should address how this approach might affect the inference capabilities of OPT and whether any experiments were conducted to analyze and verify why image captioning performance appears to be minimally impacted. Further insight into this aspect of the methodology would enhance the paper's robustness and contribute to a better understanding of the results.Im glad to improve my score if my   concerns be addressed.

### Summary
This paper introduces CrossGET, a token reduction-based strategy, to accelerate vision-language transformers. The key contributions of CrossGET can be summarized as follows: 1) CrossGET incorporates cross-modal guided information through cross-modal tokens. 2) CrossGET employs the Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) strategy, which offers more reliable token-matching results compared to existing bipartite soft matching strategies. Experimental evaluations conducted across multiple models, datasets, and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The acceleration of VL models is highly relevant for their practical deployment.

### Weaknesses
While this paper presents promising results and extensive evaluations, there are important concerns that should be addressed before publication.
1. Some experimental results are perplexing. Table 1 suggests that ToMe performs worse when equipped with Adapter or ExtraToken. However, Adapter and VPT are parameter-efficient tuning methods that enhance performance with minimal additional parameters. It is unclear how they could instead degrade performance. I suspect there may be errors in the implementations. It is recommended to double-check the results or provide convincing explanations. Additionally, the upper-right subfigure in Figure 4 is also confusing. In my understanding, CrossGET and ToMe have close GFLOPs under the same configuration (as evident from the left subfigure). Therefore, the significant differences in GFLOPs for each data point pair in the upper-right subfigure indicate that they are compared under different configurations. A reasonable explanation should be provided here. Moreover, the down-right subfigure seems to be unusual as well. How is it possible for the model to achieve even better performance (nearly 86) with only 1/10 GFLOPs? Are the settings the same as in other figures?

2. The contribution of the Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) appears to be minor. For instance, Table 1 suggests that ToMe and CrossGET $\Delta$ perform similarly in different metrics, indicating that the proposed CGSM may have little impact. ToMe employs the bipartite soft matching strategy for its efficiency and simplicity, and the ToMe paper demonstrates that this strategy can approximate optimal matching through extensive combination experiments. This paper should provide more evidence (visualizations, analytical experiments) to justify the effectiveness of the proposed CGSM.

3. Most experiments in this paper focus on Image-Text retrieval tasks. Is the proposed method equally effective in other VL tasks, such as the CoOP benchmark or open vocabulary segmentation?

4. This paper lacks an important comparison. [1] proposes reducing the number of tokens through clustering and demonstrates better performance than ToMe in accelerating transformers. However, this paper only briefly mentions it in the introduction without further discussion or comparisons. It is recommended to include more comparisons ([1] vs. CrossGET $\Delta$, [1] + CGM&CGE vs. CrossGET $\star$, etc., better in dense prediction tasks) with [1].

I am glad to increase my rating if my concerns are addressed.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes cross guided matching and cross guided ensemble as cross-modal importance indicator. Besides, a Complete-Graph Soft Matching algorithm is proposed as an improved version of ToME's bipartite soft matching.

### Strengths
1. Both Cross Guided Matching (CGM) and Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) is well motivated and proved to be effective.
2. Extensive experiments are conducted on several vision language tasks for both modal indenpendent VL model (CLIP) and modal dependent VL model (BLIP2). I do recognize the amount of work that went into this submission.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed approach is named as Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens, however, I find that the proposed Cross-Guided Ensemble (CGE) is not that useful as illustrated in Table 1. So, I think the paper should re-organize the structure and highlight the really useful designs.
2. The proposed Complete-Graph Soft Matching is not specialized for cross-modal tasks, so does it outperform the ToMe algorithm in general visual recognition tasks?

### Questions
The proposed method can improve the model efficiency after training with little performance loss, and I am curious if the proposed method can also accelerate the training of multi-modal tasks.

### Summary
The paper proposes CrossGET to accelerate VLM by token merging. Specifically, this work introduces complete-graph matching to partition tokens and merge/reduce tokens based on similarities. The experimental results on common vision-language tasks demonstrate some effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The paper is well-organized and the presentation is good. The motivation of accelerating VLMs is clear.

### Weaknesses
1. The major issue is novelty. CrossGET is incremental over ToMe by replacing ToMe's matching algorithm, adding learnable tokens and adapt unimodal ToMe to the multimodal setting.
2. As shown in Table 1, the newly proposed matching algorithm has marginal improvements.
3. CrossGET is proposed to accelerate heavy VLMs. However, majority of experiments are carried out on relatively light-weighted BLIP. There's only a small section for the truly heavy BLIP2, which is a stronger VLM that really needs acceleration.
4. CrossGET requires fine-tuning of VLMs. (1) In most cases, when models need fine-tuning, they are relatively small (acceleration is not demanding). (2) Huge VLMs that are really heavy can be used as zero-shot in different tasks or different datasets of a same task. In this sense, CrossGET which does not apply to pre-training stage is a bottleneck.
5. The paper fails to compare or adapt relevant works [1][2].

**Final recommendation**: I agree the paper is improved by additional experiments and extensive analysis, and thus I raise my rating to 5.

### Questions
When CrossGET is applying to Flamingo or BLIP2 which uses frozen LLMs, it reduces to accelerating only vision encoders? Then, there will be a bunch of alternative approaches in accelerating ViTs?
