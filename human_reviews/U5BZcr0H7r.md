# Multi-Armed Bandits with Abstention

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
We introduce a novel extension of the canonical multi-armed bandit problem that incorporates an additional strategic element: abstention. In this enhanced framework, the agent is not only tasked with selecting an arm at each time step, but also has the option to abstain from accepting the stochastic instantaneous reward before observing it. When opting for abstention, the agent either suffers a fixed regret or gains a guaranteed reward. Given this added layer of complexity, we ask whether we can develop efficient algorithms that are both asymptotically and minimax optimal. We answer this question affirmatively by designing and analyzing algorithms whose regrets meet their corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. Our results offer valuable quantitative insights into the benefits of the abstention option, laying the groundwork for further exploration in other online decision-making problems with such an option. Numerical results further corroborate our theoretical findings.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studies a multi-armed bandit setting which features abstention, meaning that after selecting an arm, the agent has the option to suffer a fixed regret c (called fixed-regret setting) or to gain a fixed reward c (called fixed-reward setting). For each abstention model, authors propose lower bounds, an algorithm tackling the corresponding regret minimization problem, and its associated upper bounds, both in terms of asymptotic and minimax bounds.

### Strengths
- Originality : Algorithm 2, which allows to turn any “canonical” bandit algorithm into an abstention-featuring algorithm, is original while simple to implement.
- Quality : I did not check the proofs in Appendix in detail, but the results seem consistent (and good) and the outlines of the proof logical. The baselines and the different experimental settings considered in the experimental study and the Appendix make sense and are convincing.
- Clarity : I think the paper is very well-written, and distinguishes clearly the different settings, and types of theoretical results. The remarks are relevant and interesting.
- Significance : The topic of assessing whether adding abstention to an online learning allows to improve the performance of the agent is theoretically interesting.

### Weaknesses
- Significance : In terms of real-life applications (clinical trials), I am not totally convinced by the considered abstention model(s). In both fixed-regret and fixed-reward settings, the fact that the agent gets access to the stochastic reward no matter the value of Bt does not seem realistic, as it implies that there is some estimation of the reward/regret from pulling a treatment arm (referring to paragraph 3 on page 1). Please correct me if I am wrong.

### Questions
- In the experimental sections (both in the main paper for the fixed-regret setting and in the Appendix for the fixed-reward setting), in the plots at fixed T=10,000, perhaps it would be fairer to report the lines corresponding to the regret incurred by the baselines at T=10,000 in each setting, as the baselines seem to fare (slightly) better than the proposed algorithms for lower values of c (in the fixed-reward setting: ex. c=0.5 in the first instance) and for greater values of c (in the fixed-regret setting: ex: c=0.4 in the first instance) than shown in the empirical regret curves. 
- epsilon(=1/K)-TS is asymptotically and minimax optimal for other one-dimensional exponential families (Poisson, Gamma, etc.). Since your algorithmic contributions partially rely on the analysis of epsilon-TS, how hard would it be to extend your results beyond Gaussian distributions?

### Summary
This paper considers a multi-armed bandits problem with the choice of abstention. Specifically, after choosing an arm to pull, the algorithm can choose to abstain. In this case, it will observe the random reward, but not receive it. Instead, its reward at this time is a fixed value $c$ (fixed reward setting), or its regret at this time is a fixed value $c$ (fixed regret setting). In both cases, the authors provide algorithms that achieve tight regret upper bounds. They also use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms.

### Strengths
The proofs seem to be correct, and the paper writing is good. The studied problem is interesting.

### Weaknesses
My main concern about this paper is that its contribution seems limited. Though the problem setting is interesting, the algorithms (as well as the analysis) seem straightforward, and I do not see novel techniques or insights in it. Besides, no proof sketch is provided in the main text, and there is also no discussion about this paper's theoretical novelty.

I also have concerns about the motivation, e.g., in the example of clinical trials (in the section of the introduction), what is the reason that we do not count the random outcome in reward in the case that we can observe it? In my opinion, the abstention is like that we can pay an extra cost to avoid catastrophic outcomes. This seems more natural than the fixed regret setting or the fixed reward setting. 

My next question is why we apply a Thompson Sampling based algorithm but not a UCB-based algorithm? Would a UCB-based algorithm work in this setting? What's its performance in experiments?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel extension of the standard MAB problem to include the option of abstention while pulling an arm: at each arm pull, the agent has the option to abstain from obtaining a stochastic reward and instead accept one of the following 2 options: (a) suffer a fixed regret, or (b) gain a guaranteed reward. For both options, the authors designed and analyzed algorithms whose regrets match the  minimax-optimal and asymptotically optimal lower bounds. Numerical simulations are also provided to corroborate the theoretical results.

### Strengths
Originality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The algorithms and analysis are non-trivial extensions of the known methods in the MAB literature

Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The analysis seems to be correct

Clarity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow
- The algorithms and analysis are clearly explained
- Great intuition provided for the behavior of the algorithms and their analysis

Significance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Incorporating the abstention into the standard MAB model lays the groundwork for understanding complex real-world online learning systems (as evident from the motivating example of clinical trials in the paper)

### Weaknesses
- Insufficient numerical experiments: While the authors have carefully chosen the arm means $\mu^{\dagger}$ and $\mu^{\ddagger}$ for the experiments, I would like to see the numerical experiments for arbitrary values of arm means and large number of arms.
- "Gaussian" is spelt incorrectly in Lemmas 3 and 4 in Appendix B (independent $\sigma$-sub-"Guassian")
- While proving $(\star)_{i}$ in the asymptotic upper bound for the fixed regret setting (Appendix C), $\beta(b, \mu, K)$ isn't defined until Lemma 5.
- It will be great if the authors can provide a proof sketch of Lemma 5 (instead of referring the readers to Korda et. al. (2013)) in the appendix for the sake of completeness.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new stochastic multi-armed bandit setting, where instead of just having the option of pulling one of the K arms in each round the learner also has the option to abstain. The authors consider two models: one where abstaining incurs a fixed known reward to the agent and one where abstaining incurs a fixed known regret to the learner. Importantly, in every round the agent specifies both which arm to pull and whether to abstain or not. Even if the agent chooses to abstain, they sill observe a sample of the reward of the arm chosen from the true distribution of the rewards of the arm. 

In the fixed regret setting, the authors provide an algorithm that achieves both a minimax optimal and an asymptotically optimal regret bound. Their algorithm builds upon a variant of Thompson sampling by Jin et al. '23, where a natural criterion is added that determines whether the learner should abstain or not. In order to show the optimality of their algorithm the authors extend well-known lower bounds from the stochastic multi-armed bandit literature to the setting they consider.

Similarly, in the fixed reward abstention setting the authors provide a transformation from algorithms that perform well in the traditional multi-armed bandit setting to algorithms that perform well in the setting that the paper considers. In particular, the authors show various instantiations of these transformations that obtain optimal minimax and asymptotic regret bound. In order to establish the optimality of their upper bounds, the authors prove matching lower bounds.

### Strengths
- Learning with the option of abstention is an interesting line of work that the learning theory community is excited about. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that considers this problem in the context of multi-armed bandits.

- The algorithms that are provided are clean and elegant. 

- The result are interesting, and even though the techniques are a natural adaptation of known results to the abstention setting, the analysis is not entirely straightforward.

- The authors present their results in a clear manner, without overselling their contributions.

### Weaknesses
- I think the main weakness has to do with the abstention model that the authors consider. While both having an option that gives a fixed reward or incurs a fixed regret to the learner seem natural to me, being able to observe the sample from the arm that was chosen when the agent chooses to abstain feels a bit too strong. I think the authors need to elaborate a bit on this assumption they have made.


Not weaknesses, but I'm writing some small issues that could be improved.

- It would be nice if the authors could give longer sketches of the proofs in the main body, even though I understand that there isn't enough space. One suggestion would be to move all the experiments to the appendix, since this is mostly a theoretical work and the algorithms are straightforward to implement I don't see what value the experiments add to the paper.

- Since the fixed reward setting is easier to analyze it might make sense to change the order of the presentation between sections 3, 4.

### Questions
1) Please see the main weakness.

2) If we assume that when the learner abstains they don't observe the sample from the arm they chose, what is the regret bound they get?

3) Is there a way to state the regret bound of algorithm 2 as a function of the regret of the base algorithm? Since this is a black-box transformation I would expect to see this type of result.
