# Learning to Select In-context Examples from Reward

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have impressive in-context learning ability. When prompted with a few examples of the same task, LLMs can solve new questions without task-specific training, demonstrating their ability of in-context learning. 
Recent studies revealed that the selection of contexts can significantly affect the LM’s answer quality. 
In this work, we propose Reward-Guided Example Selection(ReGES), a novel method that learns to iteratively select in-context examples conditioned on the input question from feedback.
Given a task and an example set, we use the MCTS algorithm to select different in-context examples, collect the LLM’s outputs, and evaluate their accuracies. 
Then, we leverage the offline RL algorithm to train a value function to estimate the reward from in-context learning. 
During inference, we iteratively select a sequence of in-context examples for the given question based on the prediction of the value function.
Our method substantially improves the performance of several LLMs (Vicuna, LLaMA-2, GPT3.5) on four benchmarks (GSM8K, Strategy QA, TREC, QNLI), and can be combined with in-context example retrieval method to give further improvement. 
When combined with BM25, ReGES achieves up to $+6.6$ accuracy improvement with an average of $+2.25$ over strong baselines.
Moreover, we observe consistent improvement while applying the in-context examples selected by our method to language models that are not used during the training phase, demonstrating its generalization ability.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper propose a method ReGES to better organize in-context exemplars through MCTS searching. The searching is guided by a value model that is trained with contrastive learning.
To show the efficacy of ReGES,  ReGES is evaluated on various LLM (i.e., Vicuna, LLaMA-2, GPT3.5) and datasets (i.e., GSM8K, Strategy QA, TREC, QNLI).

### Strengths
- Using MCTS to search in-context examples is an intuitive and effective idea.
- The paper is mostly well written, with intensive experiments and analysis on various aspects of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The author mentioned the generalization ability across models, where ReGES trained on data collected from LLaMA-13B can be applied to other models, but it's unclear whether ReGES can be generalized across datasets. This generalization ability is not trivial as many benchmarks (e.g., BIG-bench, MMLU) consists of dozens of tasks and it would be time-consuming to train a value model for each of these tasks. 
- It's better to consider the inference latency when applying MCTS compared to other baselines. 
- It's also unknown how the performance will change if we replace the value model from Flan-T5 with another.

### Questions
- How about the generalization ability across datasets?
- How about the inference latency compared with baselines?
- Will the results vary much if we choose another backbone for value model? 

Minor suggestion: It's better if the format (e.g., bolded or not, decimal precision) of results in and across tables is consistent.

### Summary
This work focuses on the challenge of improving the in-context learning ability of LLMs by proposing a novel method called Reward-Guided Example Selection (ReGES). The main contribution of this work is the development of an iterative example selection process that leverages the MCTS algorithm and offline RL to train a value function for estimating rewards from in-context learning. The proposed approach demonstratesperformance improvements on several LLMs and benchmarks, and exhibits generalization ability.

### Strengths
1. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of ReGES by applying it to several LLMs, including Vicuna, LLaMA-2, and GPT3.5, and evaluating its performance on four benchmarks: GSM8K, Strategy QA, TREC, and QNLI. The results show improvements in performance compared to baseline methods.

2. This work reveals the generalizablity of ReGES. The authors observe consistent improvement when applying the in-context examples selected by ReGES to language models that were not used during the training phase. This finding suggests that the proposed method have potential to be effectively applied to a wide range of LLMs and tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of comparison with stronger baselines such as [1, 2, 3, 4]. Especially, [1] also applies an RL-based method to select in-context examples. At least you should conceptually compare with these existing work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method to iteratively select in-context learning examples for a given task. The method consists of two steps: (1) using the MCT5 algorithm to generate a set of examples-performance pairs, and (2) using the generated data to train a value function that can estimate the reward of using different in-context examples for a given input. At inference time, the method selects the optimal in-context learning examples based on the value function. The authors conduct experiments on four datasets (GSM8K, Strategy QA, TREC, and QNLI) with several models (Vicuna, LLaMA-2, and GPT3.5).

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-structured and easy to understand. 
2. The main novelty of this paper is to formulate the problem of selecting in-context learning examples as a sequential decision-making problem. This is a reasonable approach, considering that the order of examples also affects the ICL performance [1]. 
3. The experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed iterative selection method can improve the performance in some cases/scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern about this paper is the application range of the proposed method. As far as I understand, the method requires training a separate “value function” for each dataset, which involves both data generation and model training. Moreover, when using the MCTS algorithm to generate the examples-performance pairs, it has to make inference for each combination. This seems to be costly in terms of both tokens and GPU fees, especially in the time when using LLMs as a service. 
2. When making predictions, the proposed method needs to iteratively select question-answer pairs from the example pool using the “value function”. This introduces a latency in inference time. The authors should provide some information about the cost of their method. 
3. The experimental evaluation is insufficient. The authors only perform experiments on four datasets, which is not enough to draw a solid conclusion. More experiments should be conducted and compared with related work [2][3].
4. The experiments should also include out-of-distribution tasks, especially considering that the “value function” needs to be trained for every dataset. The authors at least needs to justify when OOD happens, the “value function” still works.

### Questions
Can you provide the information for both the "value function" training cost and inference latent at test time?

(4) The proposed method is evaluated on multiple LLMs, demonstrating its generalization ability.

### Weaknesses
(1) The compared baselines may be simple. Actually, these baselines seems to be general, which are for general retrieval tasks instead of specially tailored to prompt selection task.

(2) The studied topic is very popular with many previous works. This paper seems to only cover some of the previous works. It will be great to compare or discuss these previous works, so the position of this paper is more clear.

### Questions
(1) It seems that all the baselines are for general retrieval purpose, and none of them are specially tailored to prompt selection task? If there any reason why these baselines (which are specially tailored to prompt selection task) are not included in the comparison? Even if the settings are not exactly the same, might some baselines be adjusted to be applied in the setting studied in this paper? If the paper studies a unique novel setting where no previous papers' approaches can be used, can you previous justify why the novel setting is practical and well-motivated (by some real-world use case or case study)?

(2) Can you please describe the differences between this paper and the following papers? Even some papers may not directly compared in the experiments, some discussions will be greatly appreciated.
