# GROOT: Learning to Follow Instructions by Watching Gameplay Videos

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
We study the problem of building a controller that can follow open-ended instructions in open-world environments. We propose to follow reference videos as instructions, which offer expressive goal specifications while eliminating the need for expensive text-gameplay annotations. A new learning framework is derived to allow learning such instruction-following controllers from gameplay videos while producing a video instruction encoder that induces a structured goal space. We implement our agent GROOT in a simple yet effective encoder-decoder architecture based on causal transformers. We evaluate GROOT against open-world counterparts and human players on a proposed Minecraft SkillForge benchmark. The Elo ratings clearly show that GROOT is closing the human-machine gap as well as exhibiting a 70% winning rate over the best generalist agent baseline. Qualitative analysis of the induced goal space further demonstrates some interesting emergent properties, including the goal composition and complex gameplay behavior synthesis.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper focuses on creating agents that complete tasks specified by a demonstration clip: agent is placed in the world and is given a demonstration clip of the goal, and agents' goal is to complete the task specified in the video. The paper proposes a new method for training such policy on unsupervised data (only videos, no skill/task labels needed). The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines by a significant margin.

### Strengths
Overall, considering the inclusion of a promising method and a new benchmark in a challenging environment, I recommend this paper for acceptance in ICLR. I have some hesitations around the results and comparisons (see weaknesses), which is why I steer away from strong accept, but I believe these results and contributions to be useful for ICLR community as a whole.

### Originality

The proposed idea is new, and a surprisingly simple to implement. The work done for evaluation is also novel in this exact setup. The idea of using demonstration-conditioned policies is not novel per-se, but is under-explored compared to using reward signals or simple human feedback.

### Quality

The results are solid: the paper presents a new (large) benchmark for testing models in the studied setting, and compare the proposed method against baselines, outperforming them with a clear margin. The experiments also push the method's limits with longer horizon tasks and ablate results, and also study the learned embeddings/model.

Compared to some other Minecraft results in recent years, all results were done in the "hardest" Minecraft version (one used by OpenAI VPT), without using additional helper information.

### Clarity

Paper is well structured and readable, however the amount of content makes it slow to digest (see weaknesses).

### Significance

I believe many readers in this field (conditioned agents in complex environments) would find these results useful, and would build upon the proposed method. The included benchmark is useful for future exploration to this field as well.

### Weaknesses
### Flawed comparisons to baselines

While STEVE-1 text/visual comparison is valid, being also goal conditioned policy, VPT models are not conditioned in any way. While it provides a decent "unconditioned baseline" result, it is not surprising that conditioning the policy improves the results. However, this is somewhat minor weakness, as there are no other baselines in the field.

### (Minor) Some uncertainty around the results

Figures 5 and 6 have rather high error bars which could indicate that results are not significantly different (see questions). Also, there are some questions around the evaluation and inference setup (see questions), which reduces my confidence in the results. However, overall, I believe the results hold and find the proposed architecture beneficial.

### (Minor) Generalization

Method was only tested on one (but complex) environment, and the tasks provide initial tools already (and the tasks are rather short-horizon). However these are more of ideas for future work than real weaknesses of the work.

### (Minor) Clarity

The paper is slightly hard to digest, but I feel this is mostly due to the amount of content (new model, human evaluation and new benchmark). Some details were kept in the appendix or missing (see questions).

I'd suggest proof-reading the paper for typos (e.g., Figure 5, "Comparision" -> "Comparison", or Page 9, "Minecraft is attracting increasing researchers". This should probably be "Minecraft is attracting _an_ increasing _number_ of researchers").

### Questions
1) Can you provide more details on  the human participants? Mainly following parts: how were they recruited (e.g., asked inside the lab, advertised on an online community). Did they have previous experience with Minecraft? Did they get to practice Minecraft? What instructions were they given for data collection / evaluation, during and prior the data collection? Were human participants made aware how the data collected will be used (i.e., for AI research)?
2) What are the error bars in Figure 3a? I understood the ELO rating is deterministic (given the set of comparisons/results), and does not model the uncertainty.
3) Figure 5 and 6, what are the error bars (and can you report N in the caption, I believe it is 25)? While there is trend that one is higher than the other, the scale of noise makes me wary of the results.
4) Was the night vision effect also added when VPT and STEVE agent played? They were not trained with this effect enabled, which might have skewed their results (but I do not expect huge change).
5) Do you have ablation results for the logit-substraction trick described in Appendix C.2? You highlight it as an important change, but it is hard to tell how important it is given there are no results reported for this change.
6) How did you determine 1500 pairwise to be sufficient for the ELO rankings? I assume the ranking did not change towards the end of the collection. However, I'd recommend you to also see if other metrics like TrueSkill would paint the similar picture. TrueSkill is much like ELO, but also tracks uncertainty of the rankings.

### Summary
This work proposes a new agent architecture GROOT that learns goals from videos. The encoder-decoder transformer-based agent, learns from supervised videos with actions and is able to replicate the goals in reference videos. The agent GROOT is evaluated on a fairly comprehensive benchmark Minecraft SkillForge which covers a wide range of activities. Results are competitive and open up for more follow-up works in this domain.

### Strengths
The newly designed benchmark is a nice addition to help the evaluation of the proposed agent. It covers a wide range of different activities in the Minecraft environment, including some long-horizon tasks, building tools. Release of the evaluation benchmark is able to help the community.

The design of the model architecture intuitively makes sense.

### Weaknesses
There are not enough training details disclosed in the paper. Ablation on the KL loss is nice. More ablation studies on for example the number of learnable tokens would be appreciated. These experiments will further validate the robustness of the model for the task.

The training of the model still requires action input. This means that for raw video, GROOT relies on inverse dynamics model to generate pseudo action labels. The idea of an agent learning from video might have oversold the novelty of the architecture/algorithm. The attempt to sell the algorithm as unsupervised learning is repeated in the conclusion section.

The position of the figures are out of order with the experiment/result section, making it hard to navigate.

### Questions
Figure 3 bottom rows have both the baselines not achieving any of the task, with the first plot in row 2 having the weaker baseline outperforming the VPT fine-tuned in the experiment. Is there a particular explanation towards this?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method that utilizes reference videos as instructions to reduce the cost of text-gameplay annotations in constructing controllers that follow open-ended instructions. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the authors employ an encoder to map reference videos to the goal space, followed by a decoder acting as a goal-conditioned policy. The paper establishes a benchmark in the Minecraft, and demonstrating the effectiveness of video-based instructions compared to textual and visual instructions.

### Strengths
Significance: This paper addresses an interesting problem, that is, using gameplay videos to train instruction-following controllers, and validates the effectiveness of videos compared to visual information and text.

Originality: The main innovation of this paper lies in proposing a method for learning the representation of video instructions (i.e., goal space) and providing relevant theoretical derivations. Through ablation experiments, the paper demonstrates that imposing constraints on the goal space can improve performance. The visualization of the goal space is also intuitive.

Quality: This paper provides a theoretical basis for the main innovation and conducts a fair comparison with baseline methods.

Clarity: The description of the methods in this paper is clear, but some symbols lack descriptions, and some implementation details are insufficiently described, which makes the reading a bit confusing.

### Weaknesses
1. The modeling method for video instruction in this paper is innovative and can improve performance. However, since the low-level controller still needs to select task-related videos as instructions when performing specific tasks (Section 5.1), it cannot be well adapted to LLM-based planning agents. Although the video instructions used are generated from other biomes, it only proves the controller's generalization ability in specific tasks, rather than the generalization ability for video instructions.
- Can the authors validate the controller's generalization ability for diverse tasks by providing relevant video instructions for unseen tasks and skills? This would be of great significance for the integration of LLM-based planning agent capabilities.
- If GROOT is combined with a high-level planner, how would it construct video instructions?
- For the results in Figure 7, how are the two video instructions of GROOT specifically input to the controller? Is it directly combined and input, or is the video switched manually after reaching the specified depth?

2. Although the paper often emphasizes learning from gameplay videos, the inverse dynamic model (IDM) is based on VPT, and there is a lack of discussion on IDM. Therefore, I believe that the essence of this paper is to use task-related state sequences as instructions and train a goal-conditioned policy. Using state sequences as instructions/goals for training agents is not uncommon. Methods such as GATO[1], AD[2] directly input demonstrations as token sequences into transformers, while [3] uses VLM to extract video information. Even without imposing constraints on the goal space, agents can exhibit good performance. The authors should compare or discuss these methods.

3. As shown in Figure 5, if the video contains multiple goals, the performance may be affected. Would this lead to more stringent requirements for video quality during application?

4. In Figure 6, when the KL loss is ablated, the performance decreases. Can the authors provide a visualization of the goal space without KL loss to explain its contribution to the agent's generalization in the goal space? As a significant part of the main contribution, the KL loss needs to be analyzed in more detail.

5. Additionally, there are several unclear descriptions in the paper that may affect the understanding of the method.
- In Section 3, symbols like $\theta$ lack explicit definitions.
- In Equation 13, why does log $p(a_τ|s_{0:τ})$ depend solely on the environment dynamics?
- In Section 4.1, what does "a set of learnable embeddings" specifically refer to?
- How is the segment length T set? Is there only a single goal within each segment?
- In Equation 3, is the policy goal-conditioned?
- There is a lack of detailed description for the baselines, as well as an explanation for why VPT(rl) would achieve the worst results.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors propose GROOT, a video-goal-based instruction following agent. GROOT consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, with a video encoder for goal-conditioning and a causal transformer for the action policy. This architecture enables the agent to be conditioned on videos as flexible multi-task goals, rather than the more limited spaces of language or final states as studied in prior work. GROOT shows impressive performance when tested against prior methods for training agents in Minecraft using the proposed Minecraft SkillForge benchmark.

### Strengths
- The overall paper is well written and the method is clearly presented. The proposed method is simple, and providing the ability to condition more flexibly on multi-step video-based goals is a meaningful contribution in the space of developing generalist agents, as there is an abundance of video-based data available online to learn from.
- The experiments seem thorough, with clear improvements compared to prior methods on a suite of different complex tasks within Minecraft. The paper considers both quantitative skill improvements as well as qualitative goal space analyses, showing that the learned goal space has likely captured some meaningful semantics.

### Weaknesses
- While the multi-step video representation for goals is more expressive than other prior Minecraft agents (that use language or outcome videos), having to provide a video to condition on can be difficult to do in practice if we do not already have access to similarly representative videos, and as the authors note, training the video-based goal space is challenging. On the other hand, it is much easier to describe a desired goal in language. It would be interesting to see if this method can be adapted flexibility to condition on either visual or text based goals, as in STEVE-1.
- Nit: confusing notation – changing from $p_\theta$ to $p_\psi$ in the KL term

### Questions
It’s interesting that conditioning on multiple videos concatenated together can drive the agent to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, and the embedding space seems to be qualitatively meaningful. Do the authors think there would also be a benefit to constructing synthetic clips concatenating multiple tasks and training on them as well? Even if the source video settings look very different (potentially making goal-space learning harder), it might be an interesting way of generating large amounts of interesting synthetic, multi-task data.
