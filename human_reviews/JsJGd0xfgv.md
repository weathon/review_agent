## Abstract
Utilizing unsupervised representation learning for quantum architecture search
(QAS) represents a cutting-edge approach poised to realize potential quantum advantage
on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is a scheme
to design quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). Most
QAS algorithms combine their search space and search algorithms together and
thus generally require evaluating a large number of quantum circuits during the
search process, which results in formidable computational demands and limits
their applications to large-scale quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms
can alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performance of circuits
according to their structures. However, a high-performance predictor generally requires
very time-consuming labeling to obtain a large number of labeled quantum
circuits because the gate parameters of quantum circuits need to be optimized until
convergence to their ground-truth performances. Recently, a classical neural
architecture search algorithm Arch2vec inspires us by showing that architecture
search can benefit from decoupling unsupervised representation learning from the
search process. Whether unsupervised representation learning can help QAS without
any predictor is still an open topic. In this work, we propose a framework
QAS with unsupervised representation learning and visualize how unsupervised
architecture representation learning encourages quantum circuit architectures with
similar connections and operators to cluster together. Specifically, our framework
enables the process of QAS to be decoupled from unsupervised architecture representation
learning so that the learned representation can be directly applied to
different downstream applications. Furthermore, our framework is predictor-free
eliminating the need for a large number of labeled quantum circuits. During the
search process, we use two algorithms REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization
to directly search on the latent representation, and compare them with the method
Random Search. The results show our framework can more efficiently get well-performing
candidate circuits within a limited number of searches.

### Summary
The paper proposes to learn unsupervised quantum circuit representations with a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) approach to support quantum architecture search. Smooth and compact latent representations of circuit can be learned, and well-performing candidate circuits can be quickly identified with REINFORCE and BO on various downstream tasks.

The main contribution of this work is to effectively decouple the unsupervised architecture
representation learning from QAS, so that predictor-free QAS algorithms could be applied without relying on labels of quantum circuit architectures.

### Strengths
- The paper targets the frontier research topic of QAS and proposes a theoretically sound idea of unsupervised learning of quantum circuit representations.

- The proposed algorithm is well illustrated in Figure 1 and easy to follow.

- Comprehensive experiments are carried out to show the performance of the proposed model, both in terms of the quality of pre-trained latent quantum circuit representation and in terms of the performance of QAS algorithms on top of it. 

- The article presents an inclusive overview and insightful discussion of related works.

### Weaknesses
- The contribution of the work appears incremental to me, as the main novelty of the paper sits in the employment of an existing VGAE approach for encoding quantum circuits.

- It seems that there is a logic mismatch between the main claim and the designed experiment to prove it.  In order to show the usefulness of the unsupervised quantum circuit encoding scheme on QAS, one should compare it with other schemes followed by the same QAS algorithms, and include strong predictor-based QAS model, i.e. He et al. (2023a), as references to the absolute performance of the proposed approach. Unfortunately, they are missing from the experiments.

- The experiment is weak in the models under comparison: only one baseline system is included in both experiments, and they are not strong enough to reach a convincing conclusion, especially the second.

### Questions
The proposed idea of the paper is interesting and technically sound, but the contributions are limited due to the weaknesses in the experiment design. I don't mind changing my mind if spot-on clarifications could be given in regard to the comments above as well as the following questions: 
 
- Are there underlying reasons why the proposed VGAE have the clustering effect? What do the PCA and t-SNE result look like for the model without the KL divergence? 

- How does the proposed approach work in comparison to predictor-based QAS algorithms?

- It seems that quantum circuits with a greater depth are more likely to suffer from the Barren Plateau problem. Can this factor be rendered in the pre-training model or in the design of rewards in the QAS algorithm?

### Summary
This article proposes a quantum architecture search (QAS) framework with unsupervised representation learning. The framework consists of two parts: an autoencoder that learns a latent representation of quantum circuit architectures without any labels, and a search algorithm that directly optimizes the latent representation using reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization. The framework aims to improve the efficiency and generality of QAS by avoiding the need for a large number of labeled circuits and a predictor. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework on three applications: fidelity of quantum states, max-cut, and quantum chemistry.

### Strengths
- The article is well-written and presents an interesting unsupervised approach to QAS. It applies reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization to directly search for the latent representation, avoiding the need for a predictor and a large number of labeled circuits.

- The proposed method decouples the representation learning from the search process, making QAS more efficient. They also visualize and analyze the learned latent representation and show that it is smooth and clustered.

### Weaknesses
**The lack of comparison with key relevant methods.**  The paper claims that sampling-based QAS methods have inefficient performance and high evaluation costs, but there are no comparative experiments to verify this argument. In fact, the paper's experiments were not compared with any other method, making it hard to see what performance improvements are being made.

### Questions
1. **On the scalability and robustness**: How does the performance perform when the proposed method compares with existing QAS methods in terms of search efficiency, scalability, and robustness to noise?  This may be important to reflect the applicability and generalization to real-world quantum devices.

2. **On the choice of operation pool**: How did you choose the operation pool for the quantum circuits? Could the choice of operation pool introduce bias or limit the diversity of the generated circuits?

### Summary
This manuscript introduces a framework designed to address the challenge of quantum architecture search by representation learning. The authors utilize an autoencoder-based model to construct unsupervised representations for circuit architectures and apply them to different downstream tasks. Furthermore, the authors show the model's effectiveness by employing it in different types of quantum tasks.

### Strengths
- This manuscript employs an unsupervised framework for constructing representations of circuit architectures, eliminating the need for an extra dataset of labeled circuits during model training.

- The proposed method demonstrates versatility, as evidenced by its effectiveness across various types of tasks, as illustrated by the numerical experiments.

- The presentation of the paper is excellent. The clustering figure vividly elucidates the properties of the latent representations.

### Weaknesses
This work is essentially an application of Arch2vec to quantum circuits and representing a quantum circuit with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is also a preexisting method. Therefore, the primary weakness of this study lies in its lack of novelty. I suggest the authors perform a more in-depth analysis of the distinctions between quantum circuits and classical neural networks.

### Questions
- I'm curious about how the model ensures that an arbitrary high-dimensional representation accurately corresponds to a specific circuit architecture. In essence, I'd like to understand if there is a possibility that the decoder's output may not yield a valid gate matrix or adjacency matrix.
- It appears that the size of the gate matrix and adjacency matrix depend on the number of gates. Could the authors clarify how they determine these sizes before the entire process?
- What criteria are used for selecting the initial values of the latent representation in the search process? It would be valuable if the authors could offer a worst-case analysis in this regard.
- How is the dimension of the latent representations determined? I suggest that the authors consider conducting additional experiments to demonstrate the impact of dimensions in the latent representation space.

### Summary
The paper presents a framework for quantum architecture search (QAS) that has a decoupled unsupervised architecture representation learning procedure. Based on the framework, the authors propose to use graph isomorphism networks to learn the representation of the variational quantum circuits, which enables the visualization of effective circuits. Then reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization are applied to search for performing circuits from the representation of concrete tasks. The method is demonstrated on three typical tasks of variational quantum algorithms and generates variational circuits that perform well specifically on these tasks.

### Strengths
The framework decouples the unsupervised learning of circuit representation, which provides insights on what are the essential characteristics of variational circuits that make them perform well. This feature also dismisses the data labeling and the predictor training procedures of the prior frameworks for QAS.

Multiple experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this new framework to support the claims.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are only conducted inside the new framework with alternated quantum architecture search methods. Further comparison to other QAS methods is necessary to understand the limit of the proposed method, corresponding to its drop of some hard subroutines of other methods. 

I think the aggregated circuit representations can have more intuitive explanations to understand. From my observations of the circuits displayed in Figure 3, it seems that having more parameters on each qubit and having several entangling generating gates to forge entanglement among the qubits are the key to the performance of the circuit and is also the key feature in the latent representation learning. I wonder if there are other features that are essential, and whether they can be captured by the graph representation of the circuit.

The evaluation of the search procedure is also limited. Only three methods are compared. I keep wondering what are the good design principles for the methods of quantum architecture search. 

Some minor points:
* Why in the gate matrix representation in Figure 2, CNOT gate is not directed? I.e., the order of q1 and q2 matters for the gate.
* The notations around (2) are inconsistent. MLP^(s) and MLP(M^(S)) seem to be the same thing.
* The naming of “fidelity of quantum states” is not conventional. It’s better to use the name “state preparation”.
* The details in the training of the GINs learning of circuit representations are missing in the appendix.
