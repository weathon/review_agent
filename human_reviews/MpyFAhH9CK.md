## Abstract
Robot co-design, where the morphology of a robot is optimized jointly with a learned policy to solve a specific task, is an emerging area of research. It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym,  and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm. More results are available at https://dittogym.github.io.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of reconfigurable robots, which can change morphology to accomplish a task. The paper makes the following contributions: (a) a new simulator to model both elastic and plastic deformation; (b) a benchmark based on the aforementioned simulator, and (c) a coarse to fine reinforcement learning approach for controlling such robots.

### Strengths
1. The proposed simulator and benchmark fill a hole in the current literature on morphology-changing robots
2. The proposed hierarchical control approach outperforms other ablations and another baseline in a set of experiments.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I found this paper quite interesting to read. The main limitations, I think, are:
1. It is unclear whether the proposed simulator and benchmark is a good model of reality. Is it modeling a specific robot or class of robots? Could there be some experiments to show the validity of the simulator? I'm not necessarily referring to simulation to reality transfer, but rather to show that the simulator dynamics are correlated with the dynamics of a real robot.
2. The proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning approach is relatively standard. Its application to the problem of morphology-changing robots might be new, though. 
3. I don't understand the reasoning behind the proposed baselines. There seem to be other approaches that are more related to the problem (e.g. Phatak et al., Learning to Control Self-Assembling Morphologies: A Study of Generalization via Modularity; Whitman et al., Learning Modular Robot Control Policies). Having a more detailed comparison could give a better idea of how difficult is the proposed benchmark for current algorithms.

Minor points:
1. Why are these tasks selected? What exactly is it that they evaluate? Why is it important to have them instead of others?
2. I am not sure I understand how the baseline of Neural Field Policy is implemented and whether this is a novel contribution of the paper or some other work proposed before for this problem.
3. I don't think Fig. 6 is helpful, the concept it represents is trivial and easily explained in a sentence

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could clarify why the proposed simulator is a good model of real robots, why the proposed tasks were selected, and clarify the experimental setup. In addition, it would be great to include more relevant benchmarks for this problem.

### Summary
This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach able to control a reconfigurable and simulated soft robot that has to change its shape to perform different tasks. In addition to the novel RL algorithm, which first modifies the coarse structure of the robot and then more fine-grained details, the authors also introduce a new benchmark environment for reconfigurable soft robots. The presented control approach is compared to various baselines, which do not employ a coarse-to-fine control but instead use fine-grained control directly.

### Strengths
- Exciting research with a path to being employed on real robots such as ones based on ferromagnetic slime
- Interesting multi-scale muscle field control, where course and fine grain actions can affect the robots morphology
- Introduced a new interesting benchmark “Morphological Maze” that tests algorithms for their ability to perform morphological change

### Weaknesses
- A potential weakness of the approach, especially when it should ultimately be transferred to real robots, is that the control of the robot's shape do not happen based on local interactions, i.e. the employed controller has to take into account the complete shape of the robot and its environment
- Missing relevant literature on evolving soft robots and simulators (e.g.VoxCad). "Cheney, Nick, et al. "Unshackling evolution: evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding." ACM SIGEVOlution 7.1 (2014): 11-23." In fact, in this work, the authors use a CPPN-encoding which is the foundation for neural field models and should be mentioned.
- "However, these search-based zeroth-order optimization methods are computationally demanding and inefficient” - is this shown in the paper? It's a common argument but it would be good to have some references here backing it up.
- Importantly, what are the lessons for the larger machine learning community? e.g. for which other tasks could the course-to-fine (CFP) algorithm be useful? What about other hierarchical RL methods? The research is exciting from an alife/robot perspective but it could be better motivated for an ICLR audience 
- Since this conference is about representation learning, it would be interesting to investigate further what type of representations the RL algorithms learn to control these soft robots. How do the coarse and fine-grained control interact to solve the tasks at hand?

### Questions
- Is the code available? 
- How computationally expensive is the simulation environment?
- How large is the action space?
- how is the upsampling of coarse actions done?
- What are the network details (e.g. number of layers etc.?)

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach to learning morphology for soft robot control. The paper formulates reconfigurable soft robot control as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning problem in a continuous 2D muscle field and designs a coarse-to-fine hierarchical policy (CFP) to expedite the exploration of the action space. The paper also implements a benchmark that allows simulating the plastic deformation of robots for various tasks.

### Strengths
+ Existing methods are well-reviewed, and the classification of existing challenges in reconfigurable soft robots is a strength.

+ The proposed benchmark is non-trivial, and the demo video supports the proposed method.

+ If applicable to real robots, the problem of controlling reconfigurable soft robots is important.

### Weaknesses
- The explanation of the full approach is unclear. For example, multiple variables and terms are not defined or explained in the figures, including vx, vy, and SHAPE in Figure 3, the dimension of actions, architectures of the encoder, Coarse, and Residual policy. In the appendix, the paper briefly explains that the core framework is based on existing works SAC and Nature CNN with minor modifications, but it is unclear how to reproduce the full approach.

- Given the concern above, the theoretical novelty seems not high, as the main theoretical novelty of CFP is the introduction of adding residual action to coarse action.

- The paper lacks comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods. The experiments only evaluate the performance of two ablation baseline methods and one NFP method. More comparisons will be appreciated. Besides the evaluation metric on reward, if more metrics can be used to evaluate real-robot applications, it will be appreciated, such as the successful rate or time efficiency.

- As one of the main challenges proposed to address in this paper, the justification of lifetime adaptation is insufficient in the experiments. For example, if the approach can adapt to noise or actuator failures during the lifetime operation?

- Even though the simulation experiments are impressive, there is still a gap between applying the proposed work to real-world robots, as shown in the demo video. An explanation of how to extend the work from simulations to real-world robots will strengthen the paper significantly.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new task of **reconfigurable** soft robot design. The goal of this task is to **continuously** optimize the morphology of soft robots **during** the episodes of accomplishing a long-horizon task. 

This paper first develops a simulation platform that implements the action space and transition dynamics of soft robots and environments. It also implements diverse tasks for benchmarking. Specifically, they define long-horizon tasks that require multiple times of morphology changes.

To address the reconfigurable robot design task, this paper proposes a novel RL algorithm that enables morphology changes from coarse to fine. This algorithm leads to efficient morphology optimization.

This paper conducts experiments on the proposed simulator with 4 types of tasks.

### Strengths
1. The task of reconfigurable robot design is important. This paper formulates this task as an MDP and provides a simulator that implements the action space & transition dynamics of the MDP.
2. This paper proposes a novel residual RL algorithm that shows impressive results in the 4 types of tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. There is no adequate comparison with classical robot design baselines, e.g., Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, etc.

### Questions
1. Is the action space or environment 2D or 3D? Why use 2D images as raw states for policy instead of using ground truth robot states(i.e., exact morphology parameterizations)?
