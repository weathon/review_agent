## Abstract
Most Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) exhibit limited generalization capabilities,which restrict their applicability in representing multiple scenes using a single model. To address this problem, existing generalizable NeRF methods simply condition the model on image features. These methods still struggle to learn precise global representations over diverse scenes since they lack an effective mechanism for interacting among different points and views. In this work, we unveil that 3D implicit representation learning can be significantly improved by mask-based modeling. Specifically, we propose **m**asked **r**ay and **v**iew **m**odeling for generalizable **NeRF** (**MRVM-NeRF**), which is a self-supervised pretraining target to predict complete scene representations from partially masked features along each ray. With this pretraining target, MRVM-NeRF enables better use of correlations across different rays and views as the geometry priors, which thereby strengthens the capability of capturing intricate details within the scenes and boosts the generalization capability across different scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MRVM-NeRF on both synthetic and real-world datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, we also conduct experiments to show the compatibility of our proposed method with various backbones and its superiority under few-shot cases.

### Summary
This paper aims to tackle the Generalizable NeRF task, which represents multiple scenes using a single NeRF model. The authors introduce masked ray and view modeling (MRVM) to demonstrate that 3D implicit representation learning can be improved by mask-based modeling. In practice, the masking mechanism in MRVM carries out a ray level to enhance the information interaction along each ray and also a view level to promote the message-passing across different reference views. The numerical experiments and visualizations show the efficiency of the proposed method on several NeRF image reconstruction datasets.

### Strengths
•	The paper is easy to follow, with well-written paragraphs and good section/figure/table organization.

•	The proposed masked ray and view modeling is sound. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
* Concerning the different masking strategies, i.e., RGB mask and two feature masks, it is curious whether ray-level or view-level has the more considerable performance gain or whether each masking strategy prefers a different level of masking.

* The MRVM merely carried out upon one MLP-based NeRF model, i.e., NeuRay (Liu et al., 2022), and one Transformer-based NeRF model, i.e., NeRFormer (Reizenstein et al., 2021). It would be great if more SOTA MLP/Transformer-based models could be integrated with MRVM for comparison.

### Questions
In short, this paper gives a well-written method description for readers. Some minor concerns are that the experiments for deeper discussion and comparison, as shown in [weakness], could be conducted.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduce masked-based learning and propose a self-supervised pretraining for generalizable NeRF. Specifically, they randomly mask feature token $h_i^j$ along cast rays and across refrence views, then introduce a BYOL-like module to reconstruct missing information in $\bar z$ space. In this way, the proposed method can utilize the correlations among point-to-point and across view-to-view and learn a 3D scene prior knowledge. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method is effective. It boosts the performance of generalizable NeRF on different datasets largely. Meanwhile, the proposed method is easy to implement due to its simplicity. 
+ This paper is written well and easy to understand, although there are some missing details in the main paper.

### Weaknesses
- In the experiments, NeuRay is adopted as the MLP-based network. But, to my knowledge, the MLP-based NeRF processes each sampled 3D point  independetly. It means that it is not possible to utilize the correlations among point-to-point and across view-to-view and learn a 3D scene prior knowledge. Are there some architecture modifications for NeuRay?
- To validate the influence of different masking strategies, the authors conduct experiments with three masking variants. There is missing one variant: taking the same masking strategy as described in Section 3.2 but minimize the $\mathcal L_2$ distance between $z_i^f$ and $z_i^c$. Note that normalizing the vector to unit-length before calculating the distance. This additional experiment can validate the effectiveness of the BYOL-like module.

### Questions
- As shown in Weaknesses, there are some missing details about the architecture of the used backbones. It is better to provide these details in the paper.

### Summary
The authors propose MRVM-NeRF, a framework that leverages an additional masked training objective to improve rendering and generalization ability. The method uses multi-view input of a scene to perform novel view synthesis. The masking is executed along cast rays and across reference views, along with an online fine branch supervised by the coarse stage. Results indicate that the method achieves SOTA generalization performance on simple (ShapeNet) and complex (NeRF Synthetic, LLFF, and DTU) datasets. The masked-based pretraining also improves finetuning performance. The authors also conduct experiments on few-shot finetuning on the NeRF synthetic dataset and achieve better performance.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to read and well-presented. 
- All the design choices are well-motivated. 
- Further quantitative results indicate performance improvements, across multiple datasets and settings (generalization, scene-specific tuning, and few-shot finetuning).

### Weaknesses
There are no major weaknesses, in my opinion, design choices are quite well motivated, and quantitative results do indicate improvements. I think it might be interesting to investigate the few-shot results in more detail (i.e. show that the pretraining objective now enables tasks that were previously not looked at by generalizable nerfs). 
- For example, since the model is trained on masked inputs - it must additionally be able to perform quite well on cross-scene generalization in a few-shot setting (w/o any finetuning). Even in the case of finetuning, [1] presents some results on few-shot finetuning with as little as 3-6 images on LLFF, and 6-12 on NeRF Synthetic. It might be worth comparing against the same.

### Questions
- In the case of online training, where supervision comes from the coarse branch, I wanted to clarify, do you use the same randomly sampled input points to both coarse and fine branches, in addition to the (masked) importance sampled inputs used by the fine branch?
- I wonder, do the results depend on the choice of masking? Have any other strategies than random masking been tried out (for example removing geometrically consistent regions across all the views)?

### Summary
This paper investigates a Mask-based pertaining strategy called masked ray and view modeling (MRVM) for a generalizable Neural Radiance Field. It is the first attempt to incorporate mask-based pretraining into the NeRF field. To fit the NeRF field, a simple yet efficient self-supervised pretraining objective is proposed. Abundant experiments demonstrate its benefits for different architectures and data categories. I wonder if the training code and models be released.

### Strengths
- Mask-based self-supervised pretraining has been demonstrated to benefit wide NLP and CV tasks. This work firstly attempts to introduce mask-based pretraining into NeRF field.

- The designed masking strategy and objectiveness are suitable for the NeRF field. Obvious and consistent improvements can be obtained in various settings. 

- The discussion and analysis of "prior NeRFs lack an explicit inductive bias from other views and points" and "distinct scale learning of two branches” are good, which could benefit the architecture design.


- Abundant experiments have been constructed in different settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Experiments on different network architectures (i.e. MLP and transformer) demonstrate its generalization to different models. 
Experiments on cross-scene and per-scene fine-tuning settings indicate the benefits of the mask-based pertaining to a wide range of scenes, including complicated geometry, and realistic non-Lambertian materials.
Furthermore, the setting of the few-shot scenario reveals its significant improvements on the few-views setting (10-3 views).

### Weaknesses
- If I understand correctly when applying to the proposed method, an additional fine branch would be added. I wonder if this will cause double parameters and inference costs. 

- As to the method part, the terminology is not easy to follow. What is the projector, predictor?
Besides, the parameter updating procedure is not very clear.  For example, it is claimed that “the parameters of coarse-projector are updated by moving average from the fine-projector”, what is the updating procedure for other parts?

- The explanation of different masking strategies in the ablation study of the main paper is not easy to understand. I see the details are well illustrated in the supplementary material. I recommend claiming these illustrations in the main paper as well.

### Questions
The parameter updating strategy and discussion on the cost of the additional fine branch are necessary.

### Summary
The paper presents several significant improvements to the standard generalizable-NeRF framework, in which a NeRF is trained on a set of scenes and is used at inference on a novel scene without training. It successfully incorporates some recent advances from self-supervised representation learning, which include the use of masked prediction, exponential moving average learning, using transformer-based backbones. The main contribution is in the way these techniques are introduced into the NeRF framework, with the particular choice of the student network acting in the 'fine' sampling branch with random masking and the teacher network acting on the 'coarse' branch. Results verify the method, with significant and consistent improvements in the different metrics across the board.

### Strengths
1] The proposed method shows very good performance compared to the baselines, both significant and consistent, across all experimentation. This is apparent visually and quantitatively, though an extensive set of experiments.
2] The idea of introducing masking into the training scheme is well motivated, as a means for improving generalization to new scenes. It extends the standard pipeline quite naturally and does not impact inference time complexity. The decision to mask at two levels, within the ray and across views is interesting.
3] Incorporating student-teacher learning within NeRF is also quite a natural thing to do. It gives further regularization that is likely responsible for the improved generalization.
4] Paper is well written and organized, especially the method and experiments that explain and demonstrate the advantages very clearly.

### Weaknesses
1] The two main additions - of EMA and masking are tested together. There is a lack in understanding how dependent they are. Firstly, if one could be used without the other. And if so, secondly, what are the individual contributions.
2] Sampling is not well specified. The extra 'fine' samples - whether they are they taken, as in the classical NeRF, according to an initial estimation of density from the coarse sample. And in this respect - shouldn't the masking prediction be focused at the more important (close-to-surface) high density locations, rather than at the coarse sampling?
3] Impact on training time is not clear. Even though training time and procedures are very clearly presented in the appendix, I am missing what is the addition in comparison to the baseline, and which components are responsible for it?
4] Clarity [minor]: (i) I would suggest improving Figure 1 to include some of the notations (g, h, etc') ; (ii) What are the blue dashed arrows in Figure 2 supposed to represent?

### Questions
0] Please relate to above 'weaknesses'
In addition:
1] Have you tried comparing to per-scene NeRFs? 
2] Could you provide an ablation showing the contribution of each of the components? In particular - applying only one of EMA / Masking?
5] How sensitive is the choice of \lambda, the weight of the mrvm-loss?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel masked ray and view modeling for generalizable NeRF. With mask-based pretraining, the model can learn 3D scene prior knowledge which is useful for reconstructing a high-quality new scene from limited reference views. Experiments show that the MRVM-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis with limited views and cross-scene generalization.

### Strengths
1. The idea is novel and interesting. The authors introduce mask-based pretraining into NeRF, which provides 3D scene prior knowledge for  NeRF generalization.
2. The experimental results are impressive. The MRVM-NeRF achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results compared with other methods.
3. This paper is well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. Why do the authors use masked-based modeling to learn high-level global information? What are the advantages and necessity of using masked-based modeling?
2. The authors should add the masked modeling design to more generalizable NeRF models to demonstrate its wide applicability. In addition, the authors should provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons with SOTA generalizable NeRF models, such as FreeNeRF[1] and SparseNeRF[2].

### Questions
Can this method only handle object-centric and facing-forward scenes? In addition, can the authors provide results on the tank-and-temple datasets, where the scenes have a wider range of views and complex backgrounds.

### Summary
The paper under review introduces a self-supervised pretraining strategy termed Masked Ray and View Modeling for Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (MRVM-NeRF). The proposed method uses a dual-branch network: an unmasked coarse branch serving as the target and a masked fine branch acting as the online network. By training the masked fine branch to predict the unmasked coarse branch, the authors show that the model can learn better representations and generalize better to unseen scenes. The author claims that this work is the first to adapt the concept of masked self-supervised learning to the domain of generalizable NeRF.

### Strengths
1. This method is able to achieve better performance than the baseline methods on various datasets and evaluation settings (category agnostic/specific, generalization/fine-tuning, few-shot, etc.).

2. This method does not require additional supervision data or priors.

3. This method can be applied to various types of generalizable NeRFs (e.g., NeRFormer and NeuRay) as a plug-in module.

### Weaknesses
1. As this method adds an additional branch to the baseline network, it is not as computationally efficient as the baseline methods. The computational overhead is not well discussed in the paper.

2. Baseline generalizable NeRFs are already doing "pretraining".  I think this paper's contribution is to **improve** the pretraining by adding a self-supervised masked prediction task to the baseline methods. The author may need to clarify this point in the paper.

### Questions
1. Can the authors provide more details on the computational efficiency of MRVM-NeRF?

2. To predict coarse latent features, we take the masked latent feature as input to the prediction network (Equation 4). Can the $Pred^f$ function take additional inputs besides the latent feature? E.g., geometrical
