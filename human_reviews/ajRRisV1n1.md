# Learning the Hidden Set Locally

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 3

## Abstract
Learning elements of the hidden set(s), also known as group testing (GT), is a well-established area in which one party tries to discover elements hidden by the other party by asking queries and analyzing feedback. The feedback is a function of the intersection of the query with the hidden set -- in our case, it is a classical double-threshold function, which returns $i$ if the intersection is a singleton $i\in [n]$ and "null" otherwise (i.e., when the intersection is empty or of size at least $2$). In this work, we introduce a local framework to this problem: each hidden element is an "autonomous" element and can analyze feedback itself, but only for the queries which this element is a part of. The goal is to design a deterministic non-adaptive sequence of queries that allows each non-hidden element to learn about all other hidden agents. We show that, surprisingly, this task requires substantially more queries than the classic group testing -- by proving a super-qubic (in terms of the number of hidden elements) lower bound and constructing a specific sequence of slightly longer length. We also extend the results to the model, where agents belong to various clusters and selection must be done in queries avoiding elements from ``interfering'' clusters. Our algorithms could be generalized to other feedback functions, to adversarial/stochastic fault-prone scenarios and applied to codes.

### Summary
This paper studies a variant of the group testing problem, where within a universe $N$ of $n$ elements there is an unknown “hidden” set $K$ of $k$ elements, and the goal is to recover the hidden set using queries. In the variant studied here, a query $Q$
 is simply a subset of the universe, and it returns the following. If $|Q \cap K| = 1$ then the (single) element at the intersection is being returned. Otherwise, nothing is returned. (Notably, the most common variant of group testing is one where if $|Q \cap K| \geq 1$ then “yes” is returned, and otherwise “no”.)

The authors consider two novel variant of interest under the above query model. The first variant is a so called “local” one, where the goal is that for each element $x \in N \setminus K$ (i.e., each element of the universe not from the chosen set), and each $y \in K$, there will be at least one query containing both $x$ and $y$ (and no other element from $K$, as per our query model). The second model is a local one with an added constraint, where we want the above query to not only contain $x$ and $y$, but also be free of a pre-determined (but unknown) forbidden set of elements.

The main result is an explicit construction of a solution to these group testing problems for both of the above models. Both results have query complexity cubic in $k$, which is shown to be tight up to lower order terms, and for the second, “local avoiding” model the dependence in $\ell$ is polynomial (but the results are not tight). Technically, the construction is algebraic and seems to rely on properties of polynomial of low degree over finite fields. The lower bound follows by a simple recursive interpretation of the definition of the local model. One interesting artifact of the results is a separation between these the query complexity of these local models and the complexity of the classical model, where we only need to uncover the hidden set “centrally”.

### Strengths
1. Novelty: Presenting new local models for group testing.
2. Elegant and strong/near-tight constructive results for the newly presented models.
3. A well written paper. I have reviewed a previous version of this paper, and the writing in the current version is substantially improved, with clearer motivation, better presentation of the model, and more robust proofs.

### Weaknesses
1. Scope: Not clear that this paper will be of interest to a wide ML audience. Looking at the references, maybe a distributed computing venue would be more fitting.
2. Is the model interesting? I am not completely convinced, for example it is hard to imagine privacy constraints (as suggested by the authors) forcing the intersection size to be exactly one.

### Summary
The submission gives constructive non-adaptive protocols for two group testing problems in which only agents in one query obtain information of the outcome of the query (in this sense queries are local). This is motivated by privacy considerations. The basic problem considered is of this setting with the double-threshold feedback function with both thresholds being 1. The second more restrictive variant requires the avoidance of a set of given forbidden clusters in queries.
For both problems the existence of shorter protocols is known, however no construction exists and the contribution of this manuscript is to provide the first constructive shorter-than-trivial protocols. These protocols are longer by a polylogarithmic factor in the size of the universe.
In addition these protocols are complemented by lower bounds which are quite close to those achieved by the previously known non-constructed protocols.

### Strengths
Group testing is a research problem that falls well within the scope of ICLR and the variants considered in this manuscript are well motivated in terms of local queries and non-adaptiveness. And albeit very specific the considered feedback function is a natural first starting point for future research.
The technical contributions are well presented and apart from minor grammatical errors I am happy with the quality of the writing.

### Weaknesses
There is a gap between the length of the constructed protocols and ones that are known to exist. This is claimed to be very small, which I do not entirely agree with as it contains terms in n. I would definitely consider closing this gap as well as the gaps between lower and upper bounds open questions worth highlighting.
It seems that the upper bound results could be unified into one main result and a corollary and the same holds for the lower bounds. See my question below.

Detailed comments:
- Judging from the last sentence I would expect a more in-depth discussion of how the algorithms could be extended to more feedback functions. Actually this is later only done in some detail for one more type of feedback functions. I would suggest weakening this sentence in the abstract (or omitting it).
- page 1: "before the hidden set" rather than "prior the hidden set"
- page 1: "using as small *a* number"
- page 2: "ask *the* question of efficient"
- page 2: "Intuitively *the* presence"
- page 2: "each consecutive queries" is confusing because normally I would think this means consecutive pairs.
- page 2: I think it would be appropriate to give some bibliographic references for the encoding/decoding methods being a motivation for non-adaptive protocolls.
- page 3: the caligraphic N notation for the universe is not really used and could be omitted.
- page 3: Maybe for completeness it would be good to say that queries are subsets of the universe.
- page 3 (and in other places): I think a source from 2018 is not particularly recent.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors provide an algorithm for the following problem: there are two parties where one party tries to discover the elements hidden by the other party by asking queries and analyzing feedback. In their context, the feedback refers to the intersection of the query with the hidden set that they want to learn. In the local algorithm they introduce, they assume that each hidden element is "autonomous", meaning it can analyze the feedback itself for only the queries where this element is a part of. Their goal is to design a deterministic non-adaptive sequence of queries that allows each non-hidden element to learn all other hidden elements.

### Strengths
They present how to construct efficient Local Selectors (LocS) and Local Avoiding Selectors (LocAS) in polynomial time. Following the works of (Jurdzinski et al. 2017; 2018), they are the first ones to show how to construct such selectors efficiently. Improving over the works of (Jurdzinski et al. 2017; 2018), since they were only proving the existence of such algorithms.

### Weaknesses
- In general, I had a hard time following the writing style of the paper. The sentences are sometimes unnecessarily complicated and/or too long, which makes it harder to understand the ideas presented in the paper. My overall comment is that the paper needs a significant amount of rewriting and polishing. 

- The improper citation notation is one of my major concerns about this paper. The existing citations are not inside parentheses which interrupts the flow of the text for the readers.

- There is no need to capitalize Machine Learning in the first paragraph of the introduction.

- As far as I checked, the c.f. usage is wrong throughout the paper (https://blog.apastyle.org/files/apa-latin-abbreviations-table-2.pdf). This document says it is used to provide contrasting information but I observed that it is probably used instead of i.e. or e.g. in this paper.

- This sentence in the introduction needs citations: "Originally GT was applied for identifying infected individuals in large populations using pooled tests..."

- The words in the parentheses can be added to this sentence: "More information, applications and links could be found in the seminal book (of) Du et al. (2000) and recent literature (by) Klonowski et al. (2022); Kowalski & Pajak (2022b)."

- LocAS is mentioned in the footnote of page 3 before it has been introduced in the main body of the text. 

- The problem is not motivated enough beyond the group testing setting.

- The frequent use of the dash (-) gives an informal tone to the paper. 

- "Intuitively, having elements from other clusters in the query may negatively influence, or even clash, the learning process within a given cluster – hence, the goal is to do local learning of k hidden elements within the cluster and simultaneously avoiding the other ℓ “bad” clusters.": No need for a comma after the clash in this sentence. (Page 3)

- Typo in "qyery". (Page 5)

- Did you mean existing result instead of existential result on Page 7? If not, what is an existential result?

- Typo in "guarantying". (Page 9)

- The beeping feedback mention on Section 5.2 needs citations.

Note: I am aware that almost all of the remarks I make under weaknesses related to language and grammar concerns. I am also ware that some of them are easily fixable. I do not want to discriminate against anybody based on their linguistic abilities. My main problem here is that, when the frequency of such mistakes increase, it makes it harder to focus on the actual contents of the paper. Plus, it signals me that the sufficient effort to express the novelty of the paper clearly and efficiently has not been made. I strongly believe that expressing our ideas clearly is a skill we all should aim to advance ourselves as researchers.

### Questions
- What does "Our algorithms could be .. applied to codes." mean? Do you refer to a computer program for empirical implementation? If yes, why not provide it with the paper? Or does it mean that it can be applied to something like error correcting codes? If this is the case, explicit mentioning would be better. (I understand this is being explained on Section 5.3 at the very end but maybe a very brief explanation towards the beginning would have helped the reader better.)

- Are there another applications where learning the hidden set would be useful other than the group testing setting?

- What does "whichever are relevant" in the following sentence mean?: We say that Q is constructible in polynomial time if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm, that given parameters n, k, ℓ (whichever are relevant) outputs an appropriate sequence of queries satisfying the requirements."

- What are existential upper bounds?
