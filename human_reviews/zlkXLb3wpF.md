# Fast and unified path gradient estimators for normalizing flows

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Recent work shows that path gradient estimators for normalizing flows have lower variance compared to standard estimators, resulting in improved training. However, they are often prohibitively more expensive from a computational point of view and cannot be applied to maximum likelihood training in a scalable manner, which severely hinders their widespread adoption. In this work, we overcome these crucial limitations. Specifically, we propose a fast path gradient estimator which works for all normalizing flow architectures of practical relevance for sampling from an unnormalized target distribution. We then show that this estimator can also be applied to maximum likelihood training and empirically establish its superior performance for several natural sciences applications.

### Summary
The paper concerns path gradient estimators for normalizing flows, a reduced variance estimator for the KL divergence gradient in normalizing flows. They come at the cost of additional forward and backward passes through the normalizing flow at hand. The present paper reduces this computational overhead to compute path gradient of reverse KL, while being analytically equal to previous work. It then provides a new path gradient estimator for the forward KL. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting path gradient estimators work both in the forward and reverse KL setting on physical sciences data sets (where the unnormalized $p(x)$ is known).

### Strengths
*Originality*

- The iterative procedure for computing the path gradient has no memory overhead over non-path gradients and is potentially faster (see Weakness 3).
- Path gradients are applied to the forward KL with reduced variance by applying the same algorithm to .
- The approach has the potential to be generically applied to abitrary coupling blocks, if clarified.


*Quality*

The theoretical results might be correct, but I cannot judge at this point (see below). I have some doubts on the baseline experiments (see below).


*Clarity*

The motivation and main chain of reasoning are clear, but several parts of the manuscript lack clarity and detailed explanations (see below).


*Significance*

Making use of path gradients in order to regularize for the known unnormalized density of training data has the potential to greatly reduce compute over classical methods, so this chain of work is relevant to the machine learning + natural sciences community. Allowing the forward KL to make use of the unnormalized density is attractive, as the forward KL may have better properties than reverse KL (mode covering instead of mode seeking).

### Weaknesses
Generally, the presentation interpretation of the results can be greatly improved. I also have concerns on some of the results.

In detail:

1. The notation of Proposition 3.2 and its proof in the appendix are sloppy and I cannot determine the correctness: what is the inverse of the rectangular matrix $\frac{\partial f_\theta(x_l^t, x_l^c)}{\partial x_l^t}$? Is it a pseudo-inverse, or is it a part of the network Jacobian? I suggest to greatly rewrite this proposition as a Theorem that outlines the general idea of the recursion (that the path gradient can be constructed iteratively by vector-Jacobian products with the inverse of each block, if I am right). Then proceed to derive concrete realizations for coupling blocks and affine couplings in particular if they allow for unique results.
2. What is the cost of computing Proposition 3.2? As I mentioned in the first point, by rewriting the recursion more generally, this could easily be showcased.
3. What is the intuition behind Proposition 4.1? What is the regularization obtained from including the unnormalized density (probably something like the corrected relative weight of each sample according to the ground truth density)?
What derivative vanishes in expectation? How large is the variance of the removed gradient term? Is your result an improvement in this metric? What is the regularizing effect? Vaitl et al. 2022b have useful visualizations and explanations in this regard.
4. The baseline Algorithm 2 should not be used to measure baseline times. The second forward pass through the network is unneccessary, as one can simply store the result from the first forward pass, once with stop_gradient and once without. Please report Table 2 again with this change.
5. I have strong doubts on the validity of the experiment on the multimodal gaussian model. It is hard to believe that a standard RealNVP network cannot be trained effectively on this data, with an ESS_p of 0.0(!). I see several warning signs that a bad performing network has been selected in order to have a badly performing baseline:
	- the network is huge, with a number of parameters bounded from below by six coupling blocks $\times$ five hidden subnetworks $\times$ (1000 $\times$ 1000 entries in each weigh matrix) amounting to more than 30 million parameters;
	- the batch size of 4,000 given 10,000 samples makes the network see almost the entire data set in every update.
  This indicates that the training is set up in a way that training from samples only must fail. Given that training yields useful models in only five minutes, it is reasonable to expect hyperparameter tuning of the baseline model from the authors.
6. In this light, how much parameter tuning was involved in the other experiments $\phi^4$ and $U(1)$? Please compare your numbers to the state of the art results on these benchmarks.


Given that the theoretical results need improved presentation and explanation, and given the doubts on the numerical experiments, the manuscript does not reach the quality ICLR in the current form. Many of the proposed changes can be achieved with additional explanations and better notation. I am looking forward to the author's rebuttal, happy to be corrected on my understanding.



## Minor comments:

- Eq. (13) is missing a logarithm.
- The caption for Figure 1 is on page 21 in the appendix, took me some time.
- The statement that building up the computation graph takes measurable time is false, as this simply means storing already  computed activations in a dictionary (right before section 3.1).
- Eq. (25) is missing that $p_{\theta, 0}$ can be computed from the unnormalized density.
- If a reader is not familiar with the terms forward and reverse KL, it is hard to understand the introduction. Point the reader to Section 2 or drop it here, leaving space for more explanations on theoretical results.

### Summary
The authors propose a technique for improving the efficiency of the calculation of path-gradients for both the forwards and reverse KL loss. 
Typically, the path gradient is lower variance but has a significantly higher computational cost, preventing scalability to large problems. Their method avoids having to evaluate the flow in both the forwards and reverse directions by recursively calculating the gradient during the forward pass using JVPs. 
The speedup is especially significant for flows that require implicit differentiation for inversion. The main contributions are (1) efficient calculation of the path gradient based losses and (2) path gradient version of the forwards KL loss.

### Strengths
- The method obtains significant improvement in speed in practice, especially for the case of flows that require implicit differentiation for inversion. 
- The method obtains improved generalization for the forward KL training relative to 
- Incoporating the energy function of the target in the forward KL training is novel. And having a loss with the “sticking the landing” property for the forward KL is useful.

### Weaknesses
- The speedup for explicitly invertible flows (which are more common) is relatively minor. 
- The authors emphasise that an advantage of their method relative to those from Vaitl et al. for the estimation of the forward KL is that their method does not require reweighting. However, their method uses samples from the target, while the method from Vaitl et al. uses samples from the flow - hence the two methods are not directly comparable as they are for different situations. I think this is somewhat misleadingly presented in the text (it is presented as an improvement relative to the forward KL objective from Vaitl).

### Questions
- How come the flow trained via the standard maximum likelihood objective achieves such poor performance on the MGM problem (Table 1)?. It seems possible that poor hyper-parameters have been used as training by maximum likelihood should be able to obtain reasonable results.

- In the case of forwards KL with flows that require implicit differentiation for inversion, is it not more efficient to set the forwards direction of the flow to map from the target to the flow’s base (rather than base to target), such that implicit differentiation is required for sampling, but not density evaluation)?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of learning a distribution $p$ given an oracle
for log probabilities plus a constant (i.e., $\log p(x) + c$ at sample $x$). It
proposes a method for estimating the gradients of forward and reverse KL
divergence that dispenses with a term known to have zero expectation value, thus
allowing lower variance estimators of the gradient, with less computational
complexity than prior work. In particular, this method deployed beyond previous
results for continuous flows to include coupling flows.

### Strengths
The paper technically precise and, to my knowledge, presents valuable original
work with immediate applications. The experiments were generally informative.
Its major contribution is reducing the computational complexity for calculating
path gradients of both forward and reverse KL when $\log p(x) + c$ is queriable.

The theoretical results appear sound after some inspection.

I believe the overall contribution is valuable enough to share with the broader
ICLR community, though I was surprised that the proposed "fast" gradient
estimator was not already established. Perhaps like many key results, it seems
obvious in hindsight. The suggestion that removal of the $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log q$
term from the gradient estimate makes learning empirically robust to overfitting
is quite interesting and provocative, but unexplored in detail.

### Weaknesses
I had some difficulty reading this work, despite some prior exposure to the
subject matter. It took me several passes to make sense of what the key
contribution was, and I wished for additional clarity.  The key idea behind
"path gradients" (dropping a term that has zero expectation value) from the
empirical estimation of the gradient is easy enough to understand, but took some
time to distill from the intro [1].

Regarding the experiments, at least one sentence introducing effective sample
size would also have been appreciated.

[1] It took me far too long to realize that the expectation value in Equation
(10) was for $x_0 \sim q_0$, not $x \sim q_{\theta}$. This might have been
more clear if different symbols were used for inputs $x_0 \to x$ and outputs
$x \to y$ of the transformation, since layer indexing was only used in the
context of coupling flows.

### Summary
This work deals with improving the pathwise gradient
estimator in the context of variational inference
using normalizing flow based models (i.e., they
want a fast method for computing the "sticking the landing"
estimator by Roeder).
In particular, they are looking at deriving pathwise gradients
for the log probability term of the normalizing flow.
Computing this efficiently is non-trivial due to the
modification to the probability caused by a change of coordinates
that requires computing the determinant of the Jacobian.

They derive a faster method for computing the pathwise gradient in
this setting for coupling flows (the most widely used normalizing
flow). The improvement in computational speed ranges between 1.3 times
to 8 times (takes 1.4 - 2.3 times the standard estimator that has a
higher variance, so doesn't work as well). The improvement is
especially large for implicitly invertible coupling flows, but more
modest for explicitly invertible coupling flows.

Their formulation allows computing the pathwise gradient for
both the forward and reverse KL, allowing to also perform
maximum likelihood training.

Experiments were performed on a multimodal Gaussian distribution as
well as physics settings: U(1) gauge theory and $\phi^4$ lattice
model.

### Strengths
+Fast pathwise gradients are certainly necessary for normalizing flows,
and the current work provides this with a large improvement over the
prior work in terms of computational speed.

+The method improves in both walltime and efficiency.

+The method allows both forward and reverse KL training.

### Weaknesses
-The literature review is a bit misleading, as pathwise
gradients have been around for a long time, e.g., see [L'Ecuyer,
P. (1991). An overview of derivative estimation] where it is
referred to as "infinitesimal perturbation analysis". Moreover,
reparameterization gradients are a type of pathwise gradient, and
there are other works discussing it, e.g., [Jankowiak & Obermeyer, 2018]
or [Parmas & Sugiyama, 2021]. The current work is mainly referring
to pathwise gradients in the context of normalizing flows and
variational modeling, but the broader picture of pathwise gradients
should be briefly mentioned, and probably the terminology should
be clarified because the current paper refers to "pathwise" gradients
as the narrow application of it to normalizing flows, whereas there
are many other estimators that have been around for decades that are
also referred to as pathwise estimators.

-The experiments are a bit toy, or at least their significance
was not explained.

### Questions
I have a naive question about computing the pathwise gradient of the
reverse KL. In equation (2), it seems to me that we could rewrite the
equation by using the Jacobian of the forward transform based on the
inverse function theorem, so that the $+\log |\textup{det} ~ dT^{-1}/dx|$ term
becomes $- \log |\textup{det}~dT/dx_0|$. Then we could compute the quantity and
use backprop to get the pathwise gradient. Am I misunderstanding, or
why would this not work? Is the computation of the Jacobian too
costly?

"Path gradients have the appealing property that they are unbiased and
have lower variance compared to standard estimators, thereby promising
accelerated convergence (Roeder et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2020;
Vaitl et al., 2022a;b)."  -> Other estimators are also unbiased. The
sentence makes it seem like they aren't. Also, the "have lower
variance" is not always true. I suggest revising to make the sentence
correct, e.g., making it "tend to have lower variance".
