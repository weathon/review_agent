# VertiBench: Advancing Feature Distribution Diversity in Vertical Federated Learning Benchmarks

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a crucial paradigm for training machine learning models on feature-partitioned, distributed data. However, due to privacy restrictions, few public real-world VFL datasets exist for algorithm evaluation, and these represent a limited array of feature distributions. Existing benchmarks often resort to synthetic datasets, derived from arbitrary feature splits from a global set, which only capture a subset of feature distributions, leading to inadequate algorithm performance assessment. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing two key factors affecting VFL performance - feature importance and feature correlation - and proposing associated evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods. Additionally, we introduce a real VFL dataset to address the deficit in image-image VFL scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge VFL algorithms provides valuable insights for future research in the field.

### Summary
This research paper proposes improvements to vertical federated learning (VFL) benchmarks by addressing the shortcomings of existing benchmarks. The paper introduces feature importance and correlation as two crucial factors that could potentially influence the performance of VFL algorithms. It also proposes evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods to improve VFL performance. The study evaluates cutting-edge VFL algorithms, including ensemble-based, Split-NN-based, and Split-GBDT-based algorithms, and provides insights gained from the evaluation. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights for future research in the field of VFL.

### Strengths
1.	This paper is well-written, so I can pick the core ideas up effortlessly.
2.	The focused problem has broad interests, as VFL has attracted much attention from both academia and industry, but there are rarely practical or realistic datasets. This paper improves existing VFL benchmarks by addressing the shortcomings of inadequate evaluation of existing VFL methods. 
3.	This paper introduces feature importance and correlation as crucial factors that could influence VFL algorithm performance. Meanwhile, it proposes evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods to improve VFL performance.
4.	Additionally, the evaluation of cutting-edge VFL algorithms provides valuable insights for future research in the field.

### Weaknesses
1.	The notation needs to be clarified. In Equation 1, the summation is over index $i$, but the added terms do not contain $i$. This forbids me to understand the meaning of this decomposition of the left-hand side’s log probability.
2.	From another point of view, as synthetic datasets can be split in different ways, focusing on either importance or correlations, real-world datasets are still in more demanded. Thus, offering a more realistic VFL dataset in a related benchmark would be better.
3.	The proposed correlation-based split method may face scalability challenges when applied to a large number of parties, which could limit its practicality in certain scenarios. Could you provide more discussion about this?

### Questions
Is it possible to use one metric for reflecting both importance and correlation? Or say how should a user trade-off between these two factors in comparing different VFL algorithms?

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of inadequate feature diversity in VFL benchmarking. Motivated from a probabilistic perspective, this paper factors the feature diversity into party importance and party correlation.

Based on this factorization, this paper proposes corresponding metrics for real VFL datasets (*Shapley-Based metric for party importance, SVD-based Icor metric for party correlation*) and a tailored splitting method for synthesized VFL datasets (*Dirichlet-based importance splitting and permutation-based correlation splitting*). By further mapping the two evaluation metrics into splitting parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the paper provides a unified solution to enable cross-scope comparison between real and synthesized datasets.

Empirical experiments are conducted on 2 real VFL datasets and 7 centralized datasets. The results validate the effectiveness of the designed metrics and split method, and provide additional observations to better understand 4 representative VFL methods.

### Strengths
- **Tackling an important problem**: Feature diversity is a fundamental property that highly affects the performance of VFL. Evaluating VFL algorithms across different levels of feature distribution contributes to understanding the distribution feasibility of a proposed method. In HFL, using the Dirichlet distribution to simulate various Non-IID levels has already become a consensus and common tool in HFL algorithm evaluation. It's happy to see this paper provides an effective tool for VFL to achieve a similar purpose. This would be helpful in forming a more fair and comprehensive standard in benchmarking VFL methods.
- **Effectiveness of the Method is Mostly Supported**: The basic purposes of Party Importance and Party Correlation are well-achieved as shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4. The splitting method shows ideal results as expected. Besides, the importance splitting method has a good theoretical guarantee. It shows promise to become a commonly utilized tool in future VFL research, thereby making a significant impact.
- **Sufficient Benchmark of Major VFL Method Type**: This is the first work comparing three different classes of VFL methods (AL-based, NN-based, and Tree-based), providing insights from a broader view. The experiments are conducted on sufficient datasets with various settings. The appendix provides very detailed additional results, and the splitting method used in the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets is much more reasonable than that in previous works (left-right image half split).

### Weaknesses
- **Unclear Independent Assumption**: From the beginning (the end of Section 2.1), the reason for omitting the correlation between Party Importance and Party Correlation is not well-described. A rough or intuitive relationship would be better to explain such a choice (e.g., the independent assumption is more concise and sufficient for evaluating most cases, or explain why it is so hard to capture their correlation). Since there are two metrics representing feature diversity, it can be confusing to determine which one to use, which one is better suited in specific cases, and whether it is possible and reasonable to evaluate a specific method in a 2D grid of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
- **Seemingly Case-Restricted Significance**: As shown in Figure 5, only C-VFL reflects a significant response to the variation of feature diversity, and all other methods perform consistently robust on all datasets. It seems like there are some specific reasons tailored to C-VFL that cause this observation, and further, **it makes me doubt whether it is meaningful to conduct such feature diversity evaluation for non-compression-based VFL methods**. This may largely reduce the potential impact of this work. Besides, as shown in the right part of Figure 7, the performance rank of GAL observed on synthetic datasets is different from real ones and shows significantly low performance. The consistency level is not as strong as claimed by words.

### Questions
I am willing to increase my score if the authors adequately address the questions or clarify my misunderstandings.

**Major**

See in the Weakness part.

**Minor**
- **Unclarities**:
  - It is confusing when reading "VertiBench, when parameterized with the same $\beta$, exactly reconstruct the real feature split of Vehicle dataset." in Section 3.2 and comparing Figure 4 (a) vs (b), since you do not introduce how we can get $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for real VFL datasets. There should be a kind hint to remind readers to refer to Section 3.3 for details.
  - There are 2 real VFL datasets and 7 centralized datasets used in the experiment. However, the introduction of the two real VFL datasets is missing, it should be clearly described in section 4.2. This confused me a lot at the beginning.
  - The citation for Shapley-CMI is likely incorrect in line 5 of Section 2.2; the given citation is about the "Shapley Taylor Interaction Index". However, the correct one is given in Line 3 after Theorem 1.
- **Citation Absence or Overclaim**: As is commonly expected of benchmark papers, they are usually anticipated to provide a comprehensive literature review of related methods in this domain and clarify their connection with existing benchmark papers. However, the discussion of a recent benchmark paper, [1]FedAds, is omitted, and some splitNN-based methods (e.g., [2]FedHSSL, [3]JPL, and others listed in Table 3 of work[1]) as well as other types of tree-based methods (e.g., [4]Federated Forest) are omitted in discussion. Although it is not necessary to evaluate all these methods, a comprehensive literature review is usually beneficial for a benchmark paper to be solid. From this perspective, it would be more appropriate to restrict it as a benchmark **only for major VFL method types**, since the paper excludes some sub-type methods.

### Summary
The paper introduces "VERTIBENCH," a novel contribution aimed at advancing the state of benchmarking in the domain of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). VFL is a crucial paradigm for machine learning on feature-partitioned, distributed data. However, the lack of public real-world VFL datasets, and the limited diversity of feature distributions in existing benchmarks, hinders algorithm evaluation. To address these limitations, the paper introduces two essential factors in VFL performance evaluation: feature importance and feature correlation. It proposes associated evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods to enrich benchmark datasets and provide a more comprehensive assessment of VFL algorithms. The paper presents a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art VFL algorithms, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.

### Strengths
1. The paper effectively addresses a critical limitation in the field of VFL benchmarking. The lack of real-world datasets and the limited diversity of feature distributions in existing benchmarks have been significant challenges. By introducing novel factors and associated evaluation metrics, the paper enriches benchmark datasets and provides a more robust framework for evaluating VFL algorithms.


2. The paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VFL algorithms. This empirical assessment provides valuable insights into the performance of these algorithms and helps researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions regarding algorithm selection and development.

3. The proposed benchmarking framework and insights provided by the paper contribute to the advancement of research in the field of VFL. By addressing the need for more diverse and real-world benchmark datasets, the paper lays the foundation for future investigations and developments in this area.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper highlights, in Figure 1(b), the relatively small scope of existing VFL datasets. This raises questions about the alignment of the proposed VFL dataset synthesis approach with real-world scenarios. Rather than expanding the scope to what may be nearly impossible in practice, it might be more appropriate to delve deeper into the real-world scope. While I recognize that Section 4.5 includes experiments to demonstrate the relationship between synthetic and real-world VFL datasets, further clarification is needed on how to interpret the findings from Figure 7 to better understand the implications of the results.

2. Section 2.3 discusses various party correlation metrics, with the paper employing Spearman rank correlation in Algorithm 1. It would be beneficial to explore whether Spearman rank correlation can be replaced by the other mentioned correlations and, if possible, provide a comparison of their performance. This comparison would enhance the understanding of the selected correlation metric's effectiveness.

3. Figure 5 indicates that three out of four VFL baselines are minimally impacted by alpha and beta. This raises questions about the rationale for partitioning the dataset based on feature importance and party correlation. It prompts further consideration of whether the proposed VFL dataset synthesis approach may overemphasize expanding the scope to an extent that may not reflect practical scenarios. Clarifying the reasoning behind these observations is crucial.

4. The paper discusses the communication efficiency of VFL algorithms, which seems to be minimally impacted by data distribution. Given this, it might be more appropriate to allocate more space to extending the experiments in Section 4.5. Moving additional explanations and results, which may be included in the appendix, to the main paper, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its real-world applicability.

### Summary
Because existing vertical federated learning methods either use randomly feature-partitioned dataset or a few public real-world datasets, this paper focuses on understanding the existing datasets’ characteristics (through dataset evaluation) and on enable wider feature distribution (through synthetic data construction). Specifically, it focuses on two factors — feature importance and feature correlation — and proposes evaluation metrics ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) and algorithms on how to split datasets according to these metrics. Given the proposed data construction methods, the authors compare existing VFL algorithms over the newly generated benchmarks and provide insights about their performance and communication efficiency.

### Strengths
- The paper focuses on an important yet often less-explored aspect of dataset evaluation and construction.
- The authors have provided algorithms to construct synthetic feature partitions covering a wider range of feature distribution than existing benchmarks.
- The insights obtained from VertiBench by comparing different split learning algorithms over different $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are interesting.

### Weaknesses
- **The specific form of the correlation of two party correlation $\textrm{Pcor}$**. It’s not clear to me why the metric Pcor is defined as roughly speaking (upto an additional $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$ constant) the standard deviation of the correlation matrix’s singular values. Consider a case where $m_i = m_j$ and the two parties have exactly the same set of features $X_i = X_j$ where the column features of $X_i$ are pairwise independent. In this case, the correlation matrix is the identity matrix $\textrm{cor}(X_i, X_j) = I_{m_i \times m_i}$ with singular values all being $1$. Then under the metric Pcor, these two parties' features would have 0 “correlation” because the singular values have zero variance while in reality there is indeed a somewhat strong notion of correlation (their features are identical). I would appreciate if the authors can provide an explanation of the reasoning in choosing this new metric and whether my suggested scenario would indeed be measured as having 0 “correlation” using pcor.

- **Exploring the performance variations of feature partitioning under the same $\alpha$ and $\beta$**. For party balance using $(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_K)$, the feature partitioning procedure (algorithm 5) has internal randomness, thus making two runs of the same algorithm produce feature partitions that are likely different. In this case, I would expect to see some results on the performance distribution of the same split learning method over these different feature splits and understand how much variation there is. Similarly, I’m not sure if the argmin step (line 6) of Algorithm 1 could also yield multiple different solutions. If so, I think the authors should also explore the performances variation over these different partitions. Taking one step further, I wonder if there are algorithm ranking differences for the same $\alpha$ and $\beta$ but different feature partition realizations. If there are such ranking differences, then the authors should provide more detailed suggestions on how to use their benchmark (how many such splits should be used/averaged for such comparison). If there aren’t, I suggest the authors provide official splits after performing the sampling/optimization themselves so that future papers using these evaluation benchmarks would have a consistent comparable reporting.

- __Proposition 1__ can be trivially proved through taking logarithm of both sides of a telescoping product equality: $\frac{\mathcal{P}(y | X_K, \ldots, X_1)}{\mathcal{P}(y)} = \prod_{k=1}^K \frac{\mathcal{P}(y | X_k, \ldots, X_1)}{\mathcal{P}(y | X_{k-1}, \ldots, X_1)}$. However it’s not clear to me whether this likelihood ratio quantity really has deep connections to Shapley or the feature correlations, or is simply used as a heuristic quantity to motivate the story of feature balance and correlation.

- **Figure 2, 3, 4.** I appreciate the authors including Figure 2, 3, 4 in the paper. However, I believe they are basic sanity checks of the correctness of Theorem 1 and the correctness of the implementation of Algorithm 1, and do not provide additional new insights. I believe they should instead be put into the Appendix.

- __Communication efficiency__ Section 4.4 seems detached from the rest of the paper, as they do not explore in the axes of party balance ($\alpha$) and party correlation ($\beta$) explored in the rest of the paper.

- Minor typos: In Equation 1, the index should be $k$ instead of $i$. In Algorithm 5 (line 4), the $\cup$ should be $\cap$.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide further discussion of the scalability of their two partitioning methods? For example, how scalable is the computation of Shapley values used in the experiments (run-time as a function of the number of features)? How many partition dimensions can the optimization method BRKGA efficiently solve?
- Minor: Should the probablity $p_k$ (three lines above Theorem 1) be $r_k$?
