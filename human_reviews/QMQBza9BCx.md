## Abstract
Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for detecting non-trivial topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case vanilla persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for most existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow persistent homology to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Furthermore, we derive a novel closed-form expression for effective resistance in terms of the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to several high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and show that spectral distances on the $k$-nearest-neighbor graph allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.

### Summary
The paper addresses an important challenge: the efficient adaptation of persistent homology tools to point clouds in high-dimensional spaces. Many crucial datasets across different domains are presented in this format, but the curse of dimensionality poses a substantial obstacle to the application of an effective feature extraction method, namely persistent homology, in this context. The authors introduce two novel distance measures to facilitate the efficient utilization of persistent homology in this scenario. They validate their approach with several experiments.

### Strengths
1. The authors address a significant problem in the ML domain related to high-dimensional point clouds. While there exist various dimension reduction techniques for handling such data, a potentially effective feature extraction method, persistent homology, cannot be facilitated efficiently in the presence of noise in high-dimensional data, as they lead to substantial impacts on the output. To tackle this issue, the authors introduce a novel approach, leveraging two distinct distance measures, effectively circumventing the challenges posed by noise.

2. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis by performing multiple experiments to validate their approach. They establish the effectiveness of their method by comparing it with several alternative approaches across various datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. The main concern with the proposed method is combining kNN graphs with persistent homology. While this provides a solution to deal with noisy data, it unfortunately introduces a more subtle problem: The outliers. Employing kNN in such datasets, immediately makes outliers a big problem for the persistent homology, as if one uses kNN graph distance (even with proposed modifications), any outlier will bring extra unnecessary topological features with high persistence up to dimension k-1. 

This is one of the main obstacles to employing PH in high dimensions, and to tackle both outlier and noise problems, many researchers in the field try to employ multiparameter persistence methods. 

2. The "hole detection score" performance metric proves to be a valuable measure when dealing with datasets featuring a single significant topological feature. However, its effectiveness diminishes when there are multiple topological features of similar sizes in the data. Hence, this metric becomes most useful when one already has prior knowledge of the dataset's topological structure, as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. On the other hand, if the hidden topological structures within the data remain unknown, the performance metric loses its significance, as the suppression of similar-sized features (resulting in low detection scores) could be a desirable outcome for that specific dataset. Therefore, it's essential to approach the results presented in Figure 9 with caution, as they may potentially be misleading.

3. I greatly appreciate the diverse experiments conducted across various settings with different distance measures. However, what I'm particularly eager to observe is the application of your approach to a meaningful classification problem within high-dimensional point clouds. e.g., analyzing its performance in distinguishing between cancer and normal tissues in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Such an experiment would provide a more concrete measure of effectiveness. It would be beneficial to assess the performance of persistent homology vectorizations with various PH settings, such as Euclidean, UMAP, and your proposed distances, in this context. This approach would offer a more robust performance evaluation and further validate the effectiveness of your methodology.

4. The paper's organization could be enhanced. I suggest gathering Sections 3, 4, and 5 as subsections under the "Background" section. Placing Section 7 before the "Experiments" section should enhance the flow. Additionally, collecting Sections 6 and 8 into an "Experiments" section might improve clarity. However, it's important to note that this suggestion is a matter of preference and should be considered a minor comment, subject to your discretion.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the problem of applying persistent homology (PH) to high dimensional noisy data. They argue that in high dimension, Euclidean distance is not suitable for creating filtrations involved in computing PH since pairwise distances tend to be similar for noise generated from Gaussians. Instead, the authors propose to use knn graphs as well as their corresponding (modified version of) effective resistance or spectral diffusion distance to induce filtrations. They empirically tested their idea on a toy synthetic dataset as well as 6 single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.

### Strengths
- The clarification of how the curse of dimensionality affects the computation of PH is very clear and easy to understand. This clear explanation can help guide future studies on using PH with high-dimensional data.
- The empirical comparison between the effective resistance and the corrected effective resistance is interesting. It hints that the corrected version might be the better choice for real-world uses.

### Weaknesses
- Although the effect of dimensionality is shown empirically, there is a lack of theoretical results in explaining the curse of dimensionality to PH. See the question section for more details.

- While the paper provides insightful observations, the novelty aspect seems to be limited for the expectations of an ICLR publication.
  - The major approach is to first use spectral methods for dimension reduction implicitly (as only the distances instead of the coordinates are used for PH). This is quite natural and has been studied intensively in manifold learning. I don't think applying persistent homology to data after this type of dimension reduction is novel enough for publication in ICLR.
  - The formula in Proposition 1 is nice to have. However, as pointed out by the authors themselves, this is simply a clarification of the existing claim in von Luxburg et al. (2010a) that the corrected effective resistance is a squared Euclidean distance.

### Questions
In the curse of dimensionality part, I wonder if the authors can provide some theoretical results to support their claim. For example, can they show that the length of 1-dim barcodes is bounded by some function of the dimension with high probability for the circle data with Gaussian noise?

### Summary
The article presents a new approach to compute persistent homology of given set of data points. The approach builds the simplicial complexes using spectral distances, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, on the k-nearest-neighbor graph of the data. The paper suggests persistent homology computed based on spectral distances correctly detect the topology of the data even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. A closed form formula is also derived for the effective resistance (distance) based on the eigendecomposition of the kNN graph Laplacian. Numerical results are presented on different synthetic and single cell RNA-sequencing datasets to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1. The paper demonstrates that spectral distances such as diffusion distance and effective resistance perform well in detecting cycles in high-dimensional noisy data.
2. The eigendecomposition based effective resistance formula is interesting and might be of independent interest.
3. The paper presents several interesting numerical experimental results.

### Weaknesses
Weakness:
1. The presentation can be improved. The paper might be hard to follow for non experts.
2. The main methodology proposed is not well-defined.
3. The novelty and advantages of the proposed method are not clear.

### Questions
The paper studies an interesting problem of cycle detection in high dimensional noisy data. The findings related to the use of different distance metrics is interesting.

I have the following comments:

1. The presentation can be improved. Currently, the main methodology and several aspects are not at all clear.

First, it appears the loops and cycles are detected using a detection score that depends on what is termed as m-th most persistent features . But it is not clear what does persistences p_m of the m-th most persistent features mean? How are these calculated? How are these persistent features related to the loops/holes?  Given a distance metric, how are these features and the detection score computed? If the underlying graph structure for the input data points are not given, how is the k-NN graph constructed? These details are missing.


Next, typically, in persistent homology (as described in the intro), the resolution (radius of the ball around the datapoints) is increased, and the Betti number or other homology related features are computed. However, in this paper, it is not clear what exactly is computed. How are the holes/loops detected and what is the persistence (birth-death of holes) with respect to. Is the resolution scale with respect to the different distance metrics considered? If so, what is the role of the K-NN graph? The graph connection is predefined to find these distances in this case. 

2. In the related works section, many previous works have been mentioned where similar distance metrics have been used for persistence
Homology. How does the proposed method differ from them is not clearly described.

3. The advantage of the proposed method is also not clear. It appears some of the recent dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP seem to perform better at detection holes than the proposed method and these method should also have lower computational cost. 

4. In the datasets, the dimension of the holes detected is not clear. Note that a torus has 2 2D holes and 1 3D hole. High dimension holes are formed by higher order simplices (a k-dimensional hole has (k-1)-simplices as its boundary). Here cycles/holes only seem to consider edges, and not higher order simplices. Is this correct?
How is the Vetoris-Rips complex constructed? Given n points, the complex can have large number of higher order simplices, and detecting high dimensional holes is very expensive (can be exponential cost and is an NP hard problem).
Again, it is hard to understand due lack of details.

Overall, the merits of the paper is difficult to figure out.

### Summary
This paper aims to address the challenge that the persistent homology (PH) faces for noisy high-dimensional data, by replacing the standard Euclidean or other common distances with the diffusion distance and effective resistance.

### Strengths
(S1) The problem is relevant.
(S2) The paper is well written, resulting in a nice and enjoyable read.
(S3) Experiments include a number of synthetic and real-world data.

### Weaknesses
(W1) Some (main) statements might not be correct or precise enough, placing some doubts on the overall paper, see the questions below. I will raise my score if these issues are resolved.

(W2) The results are not very convincing: for the synthetic data, tSNE and UMAP seem better or equally good as the proposed distances but are for some reason shown only for 1 out of 7 data sets, and for the real-world data it is not clear how the ground truth is established.

(W3) The contribution might not be strong enough for this venue (e.g., PH on diffusion distance or effective resistance is not novel).

### Questions
(Q1) Are you trying to address the issue of Gaussian noise or outliers, or both? Be precise and consistent.

(Q2) The main issue with Gaussian noise for high-dimensional data is that the small noise adds up over the many coordinates, for Euclidean l_2 distance. A natural adjustment would be to rather consider l_infty, could you include these experiments (at least for the noisy ring that you consider the most), or at least discuss why this would not be a suitable approach?

(Q3) What do you actually mean with “ring”, the main example used throughout the paper? If this the circle (Figure S1), I would suggest to rather use that terminology. If this is an annulus, then Figure S1 should be adjusted. If by noisy ring you mean a circle with Gaussian noise, then it is probably clearer to use the latter formulation. On a related note, I think it would be good to include an additional figure that illustrates the different levels of noise (e.g. sigma in {0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35}) you consider in the experiments, on (2D MDS embedding of) an example shape (like the circle). This can help to get an idea of the level of noise that the different approaches can handle.

(Q4) In Related work, you write that the previous approaches in the literature amount to replacing the Euclidean distance with a different distance matrix. However, the DTM filtration does not simply do this, it rather considers a weighted Vietoris-Rips filtration with nonzero filtration function values on the vertices too. These values correspond to the average distance from a number of nearest neighbors, so that outliers have a large filtration function value and appear only later in the filtration, i.e., they are smoothed out in the process. This does not influence your results, since you only consider 1- and 2-dimensional PH, and the edges that could create loops and voids appear only after the incident vertices would appear. However, this would make a huge difference for 0-dimensional PH, since the outliers would result in persistent connected components with Vietoris-Rips filtration, the issue which is avoided with DTM (which is not clear with your current description). This needs to be made more precise. Revise if this is the case for other filtrations too.

(Q5) How do you define the adjacency matrix A in your experiments?

(Q6) Has the corrected version of the effective resistance also already been introduced in the literature (if so, provide a reference), or is this your contribution?

(Q7) Why do you not show the results for tSNE and UMAP in Figure 5? These seem to perform extremely well on the noisy ring (Figure 4), and definitely better than Fermat or DTM that you do include. Overall, you show results for different subsets of the 12 distances across different figures.

(Q7) When discussing the other approaches in the literature (such as Fermat or DTM), could you make it more explicit that these have not been introduced to tackle the particular issue that you aim to address (noise in high dimensions)? (For example, the idea behind DTM is to smooth out the outliers out, but you do not seem to consider these in your experiments?) Otherwise, it seems you are overstating your contribution, as it appears that you outperform the other approaches that were developed to tackle the same challenge. You even imply this by referring to the other methods as “competitors”.

(Q8) You group the different distances into density-based, graph-based (distances computed on kNN graph), embedding-based and spectral. However, are the DTM, Fermat and Core also not computed on the kNN graph (whereas you consider these to be density-based)? In the Discussion, you also explicitly write that spectral methods are based on the kNN graph, so I guess you need to rethink the naming and descriptions of the different groups?

(Q9) The two proposed distances, effective resistance and in particular diffusion, fail terribly in detecting both the 2 loops and the 1 void for torus, even in the case of no noise (Figure 5), but you almost completely ignore this?

(Q10) Figure 5 shows a large variance for the diffusion distance and effective resistance, in particular for eyeglasses and torus. This should be at least briefly discussed, and it would be nice to include an illustrative figure with a few different random walks between two interesting points (e.g. on eyeglasses); ideally, other distances could be visualized too.The number of different random walks also grows with the underlying dimension, since there is many more directions one could take to reach from one point to another? Can you also comment on this, because it makes one wonder why would such distances be reasonable/even suggested for very high dimensional spaces?

(Q11) Where is the variance for Euclidean distance coming from in the left plot of Figure 6?

(Q12) Why do you consider the 2D embedding space for the embedding-based distances, if you also look into 2-dimensional PH?

(Q13) Why is the closed-form formula for effective resistance useful (in your experiments or work)? Motivate this/explain the relevance.

(Q14) What are the dimensions of the real-world RNA-sequencing data? This should be explicitly stated, since high dimensionality is precisely the main focus of your work. This is only mentioned for 1 out of 6 data sets and only in the appendix, but this information should be in the main text.

(Q15) “… DTM produced only rough approximations (Figure 8b)” What exactly do you mean here, the 1-dimensional PD wrt DTM in Figure 8 clearly identifies the two loops? What’s more, it seems that the loop score s2 would be the best for DTM, since the second most persistent loop is here the furthest from the third most persistent loop (close to the diagonal)? I do not see a clear connection between Figure 8 and first plot in Figure 9.

(Q16) How do you assess the ground truth (the actual number of loops) in the real-world data (besides Malaria data)? 

(Q17) You write “persistent loop(s) was/were likely not correct”, or later, “arguably incorrect loops” but you do not explain this further. In other words, how do you determine if a bar in Figure 9 is hatched, since, as you yourself write “each homology class has many different representative cycles, making interpretation difficult”?

(Q18) Definition of the DTM function in Appendix B is weird, can you provide a reference? In the paper by Anai et al, it seems that only the case of your p=2 is considered? Are the nearest neighbors x_i1, x_i2, …, x_ik ordered according to increasing distance from x_i? If so, please specify. How does it make sense to define dtm_i = ||x_i – x_ik || (when your p=infty)? Strangely enough, all your main experimental results consider p=infty. On a related note, it is not clear to me why the DTM performs worse than the Euclidean distance in Figure S4? This makes me question how you chose the parameter values for which to report the results, and whether you particularly selected the parameters where the other approaches perform poorly.

(Q19) “We omitted DTM as all settings got filtered on all datasets.” What does this mean? 

(Q20) Interpret all the figures in Appendix G, what do we learn from them? This is currently only done for Figure S3, in its caption.

(Q21) Why is tSNE performing so poorly in Figure S5, even when there is no noise?

(Q22) What about stability?

(Q23) Multiparameter persistence is often suggested to remedy noise, by considering a bifiltration with respect to both distance to the point cloud and density estimates. How do you expect this approach to work in high dimensions?


Minor remarks:

-	Mention the homological dimension in the captions of all figures that include persistence diagrams (i.e., stress “1-dimensional persistence diagram”).

-	“…. distances due to noise dominate the distances to the ring structure” Is this really true, we can still see the ring in Figure 3d?

-	Describe the hitting time H_ij more precisely. Is the the sum of edge lengths, or the number of edges?

-	I assume that the matrix I_d is  matrix of ones (every entry is equal to 1), but this should be made explicit, as this notation is common for the identity matrix (with the non-diagonal entries equal to 0).

-	For consistency and clarity, replace “neg. control” with “0 loops” in Figure 5?

-	When you mention t in Section 7, remind the reader what this t represents. Note also that you use t to denote both the filtration scale (could maybe be replaced with r), and for the number of random walk steps.

-	… D = 2, but D is a matrix?

-	Provide a reference for the computational complexity for PH. Should it include delta+1, or delta+2?

-	Be consistent between capital case vs. lower case for the paper titles in the References.

-	The notation in Appendix C could likely be improved: the distances are functions over the vertices rather than of its parameters, i.e., it would be more common to denote e.g. Fermat and DTM respectively as d^F_p(x, y), D^DTM_k, p, xi(x, y).

-	In Appendix D, for the eyeglasses data set you write that the two line segments are of length 0.53, separated by 0.7 units linking up the two ring segments, but the width of the rectangle in Figure S1 seems larger than its height?

-	For better clarity “, and then added isotropic Gaussian noise samples from …” should probably be the last sentence in this paragraph, since the rest of it discusses the orthogonal embedding? 

Typos:

-	naïve -> naive throughout the paper?
-	persistence homology -> persistent homology
-	we mapped each… -> We mapped each
