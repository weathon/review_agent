- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a distributed learning framework that only shares model parameters or gradient updates and keeps private data locally. However, FL is at risk of privacy leakage caused by privacy inference attacks. And most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL conflict with achieving high performance and efficiency. Therefore, we propose FedMD-CG, a novel FL method with highly competitive performance and high-level privacy preservation, which decouples each client's local model into a feature extractor and a classifier, and utilizes a conditional generator instead of the feature extractor to perform server-side model aggregation. To ensure the consistency of local generators and classifiers, FedMD-CG leverages knowledge distillation to train local models and generators at both the latent feature level and the logit level. Also, we construct additional classification losses and design new diversity losses to enhance client-side training. FedMD-CG is robust to data heterogeneity and does not require training extra discriminators (like cGAN). We conduct extensive experiments on various image classification tasks to validate the superiority of FedMD-CG.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel FL algorithm, FedMD-CG, based on knowledge-distillation, which enabling clients to train a local generator for extracting the local knowledge and the server to aggregate the local knowledge from clients accordingly. Since FedMD-CG does not communicate the local feature extractors to the server, it provides high-level of protection for clients under gradient inversion attack. Extensive experimental results validate the effect of  FedMD-CG in accuracy and privacy.

### Strengths
1. The paper attempts to explore an interesting area: data-free knowledge distillation in Federated Learning.
2. The proposed method, FedMD-CG, improves both test accuracy as well as privacy-protection in Federated Learning.

### Weaknesses
1. For the classification task (which the paper is mainly focusing on), the proposed method requires clients not only to train a model for classification (feature extractor and classifier) as well as a local generator. For the server, it needs to train a global generator. This introduces much more computation overhead. On-edge learning where all clients have limited resources, the propose method might not work. For data-free KD-based FL, there is a prior work that does not need to train a generative model. I think it's better to compare with it [1].

2. The local objective and server's objective functions are so complicated. There are many terms using MSE, KLD and Cross-Entropy Loss. As a result, there are too many hyper-parameters for the regularization terms. However, there is no theoretical analysis on the convergence in the paper. The method is empirical but difficult to reproduce because so many hyper-parameters.

3. The experiments ran on simple datasets, EMNIST, FMNIST,CIFAR-10. The proposed method need to be validated in more larger dataset such as CIFAR100/ImageNet. However, more complicated dataset might need more larger model as generators, which increases the computation overhead.

4. The small problem of the paper: many notations are similar, such as $\mathcal{L}_{mse}$ with $\leftarrow$ and $\rightarrow$, really confusing. And the table 4 in ablation study, those different $\mathcal{L}$ are not straightforward.

### Questions
1.  what's the insight for the privacy protection? There is no theoretical analysis on the privacy or detailed discussion on why privacy is preserved with the proposed method.

2. how many clients do you run the experiments? If the number of clients is large, is the proposed method still working?

3. The ablation study is running on $\omega = 10$, which can be seen as IID. How about the results in non-IID setting, such as $\omega = 0.1$?

4. Do you have a analysis of comparison overhead? what's the complextiy of your method comparing to FedAvg?

### Summary
This work proposed a novel federated learning framework that aims to improve privacy. It achieves this by partitioning a classification network into two components: a feature extractor and a head. To obviate the need of synchronizing feature extractors across different clients, a conditional feature generator is introduced. The proposed framework offers an inherent advantage in privacy protection, as classical gradient inversion attacks become ineffective due to the absence of access to the feature extractor. 

The conditional generator serves two purposes: it guides the training of local heads and also influences the output of local feature extractor. To further enhance local training and global aggregation, the authors incorporate various knowledge distillation technologies.

### Strengths
1. Federated learning is well-known for its privacy-preserving attributes but is also vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as gradient inversion attacks. In this context, exploring novel collaborative paradigms is crucial. This paper presents an intriguing approach to mitigating gradient inversion attacks by avoiding the synchronization of certain network component.

2. The proposed method incorporates a complex setup including 13 losses functions and 6 hyperparameters,  which appears overly complicated. However, the authors conduct an ablation study that justifies the inclusion of each individual loss. Additionally, they demonstrate that the method is relatively insensitive to the values of these hyperparameters.

### Weaknesses
1. Despite the second point mentioned in the Strengthens section, it appears that the proposed framework has a simpler substitute. For example, rather than training an additional feature generator, the clients can share their features and corresponding labels directly. In terms of privacy leakage, this alternative is equivalent to the proposed method, since the feature generator itself is trained on local features. Furthermore, direct feature sharing can largely reduce the framework's complexity. 

2. Since the feature extractor is solely trained on the local device using the local data. The diversity of local data becomes critical for the training of feature extractor. Due to the same reason, I question the method's scalability to larger networks. As it stands, the paper only presents results based on the LeNet architecture. 

3. The experimental results reveals that the proposed method underperforms compared to baseline approaches in the majority of evaluated settings.

4. Introducing an extra feature generator adds to the computational overhead. As acknowledged by the authors,  their method operates two to three times slower than baselines models.

### Questions
1. In Section 2.2, the authors claim "However, straightforward average aggregation may counteract the local knowledge from clients." Could you clarity this statement? Is it based on empirical evidence or theoretical reasoning?

2. Given that the method shows insensitivity to the hyperparameters $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_6$ and that their valid value range includes 1, the author might consider removing these hyperparameters to simplify the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper proposes a federated learning algorithm that primarily attempts to improve privacy preservation (mitigate deep gradient leakage attacks by a semi-honest server). The main idea is to decompose the model into feature extractor and classifier components. While the classifier component is aggregated using the standard FedAvg approach, the local feature extractors are replaced by local conditional generators, which are then aggregated by the server into a global generator. In each collaborative round, the clients alternatively update their feature extractors (through knowledge distillation from the global generator) and local generators (through knowledge distillation from the local feature extractor and classifier).

### Strengths
1) The proposed idea closely follows the FedCG framework (Wu et al. 2021), but proposes several incremental innovations to improve upon the FedCG framework. Though the proposed changes appear to be complicated, they are simply based on knowledge distillation concepts and most of them appear to be intuitively reasonable.

2) The paper is well-written and self-contained. The presentation style is also easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1) The foremost goal of the paper is to mitigate privacy leakage through deep gradient leakage (DLG) attacks by a semi-honest server. As noted in the appendix, it is hard to come up with theoretical privacy guarantees for this framework. However, it is certainly feasible to come up with strong attacks and evaluate the proposed algorithm against such strong attacks. While some leakage results are reported in Table 2 and Figure 4, the paper fails to specify the exact attack mechanism deployed. In the proposed framework, the only unknown (compared to the FedAvg setting) for a malicious server are the parameters of the local feature extractors in each round. It should be possible to come up with sophisticated DLG attacks following the same knowledge distillation strategies employed for client training. For instance, can a reverse distillation process be used by the server to transfer knowledge from the local generators to estimate the local feature extractors and then use these local feature extractors to reconstruct the input samples? Can the above attack benefit from the availability of an auxiliary dataset at the server?

2) The evaluation metrics (local and global accuracy) used in this work appear to be unrealistic. The local partition of the test is stochastic and not reproducible. Given that no statistics has been reported, it is hard to judge the variations in performance. On the other hand, the global accuracy also does not make sense because that requires constructing a "virtual" model using one round of FedAvg, which is against the main principle of the proposed method. Maybe the local accuracy at each client could be computed based on all the test data and average of these local accuracy values should be reported along with standard deviation.

3) The model used for the experiments is LeNet-5, which is not a reasonable model for most real-world applications. Furthermore, this model has been arbitrarily divided into feature extractor and classifier. The main argument of this work is that the latent feature space has so-called "high-level patterns" and it is difficult to construct the input data from these patterns. How accurate is this assumption when the feature extractor is simply a couple of conv layers? Moreover, the datasets used in this experiment are also not representative (very low resolutions images with utmost 10 classes). How will the proposed approach scale for larger resolution images (e.g., 224 x 224) with deeper neural networks (e.g., ResNet-18) and more classes (e.g., ImageNet)?

### Summary
This paper proposes that FedMD-CG improves the privacy protection capability of FL. This work uses a condition generator instead of a feature extractor to perform server-side model aggregation. In this work, KD is used to ensure the consistency of local generator and classifier. The server uses KD to aggregate trained local generators and classifiers. This paper has done a lot of empirical experimental research and discussion.

### Strengths
This paper introduces in detail how to design loss and training methods on client and server side, and gives a comprehensive experience experiment. The proposed scheme makes trade-offs in terms of performance and privacy protection.

### Weaknesses
There are some unclear descriptions in the paper that are confusing. For example, the form of the L2-norm function in formulas (2) and (7) is inconsistent.

### Questions
At the end of page 3 of the paper, the author claims to design two loss functions. to transfer the knowledge of the local model to the local generator. Does this imply that the losses in formulas (5) and (6) will only find gradients for generators?

When the server trains its own model, does it need the label y to calculate losses and gradients? Does getting the distribution of labels reveal privacy?
