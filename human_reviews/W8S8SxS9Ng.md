## Abstract
State-of-the-art systems neuroscience experiments yield large-scale multimodal data, and these data sets require new tools for analysis. Inspired by the success of large pretrained models in vision and language domains, we reframe the analysis of large-scale, cellular-resolution neuronal spiking data into an auto-regressive spatiotemporal generation problem. Neuroformer is a multimodal, multitask generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model that is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of data in systems neuroscience. It scales linearly with feature size, can process an arbitrary number of modalities, and is adaptable to downstream tasks, such as predicting behavior. We first trained Neuroformer on simulated datasets, and found that it both accurately predicted simulated neuronal circuit activity, and also intrinsically inferred the underlying neural circuit connectivity, including direction. When pretrained to decode neural responses, the model predicted the behavior of a mouse with only few-shot fine-tuning, suggesting that the model begins learning how to do so directly from the neural representations themselves, without any explicit supervision. We used an ablation study to show that joint training on neuronal responses and behavior boosted performance, highlighting the model's ability to associate behavioral and neural representations in an unsupervised manner. These findings show that Neuroformer can analyze neural datasets and their emergent properties, informing the development of models and hypotheses associated with the brain.

### Summary
In the paper "Neuroformer: a multimodal, multitask GPT framework for brain data at scale", the authors suggest a transformer-based architecture (Neuroformer) for fitting high-dimensional neural spike train recordings, that can incorporate a CLIP-like contrastive learning objective to use visual stimuli and/or behavioural recordings. The authors argue that Neuroformer can slightly outperform classic GLM models for spike prediction and strongly outperform simpler models for behavioural prediction.

### Strengths
The paper is interesting because it applies modern transformer architectures to modeling neural data, and shows competitive results.

### Weaknesses
Overall I thought that the paper would perhaps be more suited for a computaional neuroscience journal or for NeurIPS that traditionally has some amount of comp neuro papers. At ICLR, this topic is an outlier, as there is very little (next to none) computaitonal neuroscience there.

Whereas the paper is generally well-written, I found many model details not sufficiently clear (examples below).

### Questions
MAJOR COMMENTS

* Section 3: I could not understand the details of the architecture from this description. I could not even understand the basic setup... The text says that each neuron is one token, is that right? So the model is limited by O(1000) neurons, as attention layers scale quadratically with the number of tokens, right? Next, what is one training example: one time bin? For each neuron and each time bin, we have some integer number of spikes. How is this number converted into an embedding vector? What exactly are past states (how many past states) and how are they passed into the model? How does prediction (as in section 4.3.1) work: what is passed as the input instead of neural states?

   Perhaps this is confusing because one would naively think about time-series modeling along the lines of GPT, where time bins (and not neurons) would be tokens. So I think the architecture setup requiers a more detailed explanation.
   
* Section 4.3.1: the sentence "our model's predictions w[h]ere more closerly corelated with the ground-truth" should contain some quantification, e.g. the fraction of neurons (or what are the dots in figure 3c: are these neurons?) for which Neuroformer outperforms GLM, and also the p-value (0.02) which is currently only mentioned in the figure caption. The evidence here is not very strong, so the authors should not oversell.

* Table 1 is the strongest result in the paper, as Neuroformer strongly outerforms all other models. However, neither the comparison models (Lasso, GLM, etc) nor the prediction task are described in sufficient detail. The task here to predict behaviour from neural responses, but what exactly is "behaviour", what is the input (how many time steps?) and the output (how many time steps) of this prediction problem, etc.? The authors should present their experiment such that it is clear the comparison models in Table 1 are not "strawman" in some sense.


MINOR COMMENTS

* \citep and \citet should be used instead of \cite. Current citation formatting is not following the ICLR template.

* Schneider et al 2022 has been published in Nature.

### Summary
This paper proposes a multimodal, multitask generative pre trained transformer model called Neuroformer. This model uses an arbitrary number of modalities, such as neural responses,  external stimuli, and behavior, to perform downstream tasks. The authors apply this model to predict simulated neural circuit activities and behavior of a mouse from its neural recordings, where four modalities are used: neural responses, video, speed, and eye position. They also perform ablation studies to explore the impact of each model component.

### Strengths
* Propose a multimodal, multitask transformer-based model for neural data modeling.

### Weaknesses
* In the experiments, the Neuroformer is only evaluated in terms of behavior prediction, which is not enough in evaluating neuroscience tasks. The choices of models (GLM, GRU, Lasso Regression) for comparison are also not convincing to me. One suggestion is to follow the evaluation criteria in [Neural Latents Benchmark](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1256/overview) and compare the Neuroformer with the top leading models there, such as S5 and LFADS on the multimodal calcium imaging datasets. It is critical to see whether the proposed model is a solid technical innovation with practical influences in neuroscience research.

* As the authors mentioned in Appendix A, the Neuroformer has poor results (Figure 10) in low-dimensional latent space learning. One possible reason is that the transformer-related neural networks are too expressive so that good dynamics in latent space are no longer necessary. But in terms of interpretability, neuroscientists prefer to observe meaningful latent space in many experimental scenarios, which may be more important than a good behavior prediction performance.

### Questions
* What kind of modalities are used in section 4.3? Although we may infer these modalities in section 5, it seems there are no clear describing sentences about them in the whole section 4.3.

### Summary
The paper presents a multi-modal Transformer-based pretraining paradigm for learning joint representations of neural activity, behavior and sensory inputs. It mainly follows recent work in vision-language modeling and adapts these approaches to the neuroscience setting. The paper shows that (a) the attention maps can reveal the circuit structure in a simulated toy dataset with a few hub neurons, (b) it can predict neural activity based on past activity and stimulus slightly better than a generalized linear model, and (c) it can decode running speed of a mouse from neural activity in a few-shot manner.

### Strengths
+ Promising self-supervised learning paradigm for large-scale, multi-modal neuroscience data
 + Nice set of experiments from simple toy model with known ground truth to real, large-scale data
 + Overall well-written and mostly easy to follow (with some exceptions)

### Weaknesses
1. Weak baselines in Figs. 2+3
 1. Small effect in Fig. 3
 1. Architecture (especially decoder) not entirely clear from paper

### Questions
Overall I think this is a super interesting and potentially very useful paper, albeit with some weaknesses, which I will detail below. If the authors can address these points in their response, I am happy to reconsider my score.

While I appreciate the experiments, I believe the authors could do a better job at demonstrating that their approach actually works well. 

### Fig. 2

It is well known that inferring connectivity from correlations is not a good idea. The most straightforward way of getting closer to connectivity (albeit with a number of limitations and caveats as well) is using partial correlations instead of Pearson correlations. I would predict that the partial correlation matrix would correspond much more closely to the ground truth than the Pearson correlation matrix shown in Fig. 2d. Does your approach perform on par with it or even better?

### Fig. 3

I am somewhat underwhelmed by the result in Fig. 3: All this effort only to improve the correlation between prediction and ground truth by 2%? It may be significant, but the effect size is tiny. Papers on predicting activity from visual stimuli typically show quite more substantial improvements of neural nets over GLMs (e.g. McIntosh, NeurIPS 2016, Klindt et al., NeurIPS 2017, ...). I would like to see some stronger baselines here. The baseline model form the recent Sensorium competition (https://www.sensorium-competition.net) would be a fairly straightforward starting point.

A second point on this figure: I am unsure how to interpret the attention maps in panel d). What exactly do they show? The word "neuron" seems overloaded here. Since the Transformer does not have a token for each neuron (or did I misunderstand something here? According to p.3 bottom the current state does not have a neuron dimension, only batch, time and embedding), I don't quite understand, what, e.g., "Neuron 1, Layer 0, Head 0" means. If it refers to neurons in the brain, please explain how and explain what we don't see localized receptive fields as we would expect from V1. If it refers to something else, please explain what and what we see. 


### Architecture not clear

I had a hard time following the description of the method on pages 3+4. Some examples:

 1. This sentence on p.3 could be unpacked: "At each step, a learnable look-up table projects each neuron spike contained in our Current and Past States onto an embedding space E, resulting in vectors (T_c,E) and (T_p,E), where Tc,Tp are the corresponding state’s sequence length (number of spikes + padding)." <-- What does "vectors (T_c,E)" mean? In particular, what is the meaning of the parenthesis around T_c,E? T_c appears to be the sequence length, i.e. scalar. Does it mean you literally concatenate a scalar that indicates the length with a vector E? If so, why? If not, what is happening here?

 1. It is not clear to me what the decoder outputs. From the text and figures I'm guessing it's some form of sparse representation of the spiking in the future, where ID is the row (column) and dt the column (row) of a non-zero entry in a binary matrix (size: #neurons x #timesteps) that contains the spikes. However, I am unsure about this interpretation and cannot map it onto the losses in Eqs. 3+4. Part of the problem might be that p_i and p_dt are not defined and I am not sure how to interpret the cross-entropies. Also, I don't understand why there are two losses. Why not simply output a vector of zeros and ones that is the same size as there are neurons? What is the meaning of dt? I thought you're predicting the next frame?

 1. The last paragraph on p.4 is equally opaque to me and I couldn't make sense of it. The sentence with nucleus sampling is unclear and the meaning of sub-intervals is also not clear.

### Summary
This manuscript introduces a multi-modal, multi-task generative pretrained transformer as a tool for analyzing the increasing volume of data generated by large-scale experiments in system neuroscience. The goal of this tool is to create a better neural spiking model while taking external variables into account.  In particular, they applied the Perceive IO architecture (Jaegle et al. 2021) to the neural domain and modified it accordingly. During the process of decoding, they also developed feature backbones, which enabled the specialized architecture to track the activity of individual neurons. Their loss function has a component that deals with alignment as well as one that deals with spike creation. The alignment component explicitly enforces representational commonalities among biologically significant features. The causal spike modeling is used by the spike generation component to do an autoregressive decoding of brain spikes. They used a simulated dataset in addition to two different two-photon calcium imaging datasets in order to verify the accuracy of this neuroformer. They demonstrated, with the simulated dataset, that the neuroformer is capable of recovering the hub-neuron structure that is comparable to the ground truth. Using the calcium imaging dataset, they were able to demonstrate that the suggested neuroformer performed better than GLM when it came to creating neuronal spikes. They also showed that a pretrained neuroformer has more accurate predictive features of mouse behaviors than baselines like Lasso regression, GLM, MLP, and GRU. In addition to this, they presented the results of an ablation investigation, which demonstrated that each module contributes progressively to predicting eye position.

### Strengths
The loss function combines multi-task representation loss with two losses relevant to generating neural spikes. To the best of my knowledge, this particular application of multi-task learning to modeling neural activity is new. 

The feature backbones in the Neurofomer are able to dissect single neurons. A common limitation of previous machine learning approaches to modeling population activity is that they lose single neurons. This feature seems to circumvent such a limitation.

### Weaknesses
Lack of comparison with strong baselines is my main concern for this submission. Prior to this paper, there were a couple notable publications that leveraged the transformer architecture to generate neural spikes. Albeit those most well-known ones are single modality only, it is still worth a comparison in terms of neural modeling. This work only showed its comparison with simple baselines (MLP, GRU) when it compared the quality of neural spike generation. If this neuroformer does not perform as well as other transformer-based architectures, I would hope the authors may include more elaborated discussion on whether the appeal of cross-modality representation outweighs its limited performance.

The F1 scores in Figure 5 are rather low at their absolute values. It would be helpful if the authors put the F1 score in perspective (why is this F1 score indicating good performance?). Is it possible for the authors to comment on the dip of the F1 score after adding the video modality in the Visnav, Lateral dataset? 

The correlation difference in Fig 3C is also low in comparison with GLM. Such a comparison will be a lot stronger if it is versus another transformer architecture or more elaborate architecture that is capable of expressing neural activity fully. 

Speed is misspelled as “spped”

### Questions
Does this architecture outperform any of those previous approaches in terms of generating realistic neural spikes? Is it possible to show the performance of the neuroformer on the Neural Latent Benchmark? 

 

What is the range of T_p in those calcium imaging datasets? Is it possible to demonstrate long-term inference with a neuroformer? 

 

In Fig. 3d, the attention maps seem to suggest that the intermediate blocks of the neuroformer contain interesting features. It is common for the community that pretrains transformers for time series (like HuBert or Whisper for speech) to use features from intermediate blocks for decoding. Is it possible to show how well these intermediate blocks can be used to predict behavior? 

 

Minor question: I could guess that the red dot is the model being used to generate b) or d). It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this in the figure caption.
