# Generative Modeling with Phase Stochastic Bridge

- Decision: Accept (oral)

## Abstract
Diffusion models (DMs) represent state-of-the-art generative models for continuous inputs. DMs work by constructing a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) in the input space (ie, position space), and using a neural network to reverse it. In this work, we introduce a novel generative modeling framework grounded in \textbf{phase space dynamics}, where a phase space is defined as {an augmented space encompassing both position and velocity.} Leveraging insights from Stochastic Optimal Control, we construct a path measure in the phase space that enables efficient sampling. {In contrast to DMs, our framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation.} This early prediction sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. On standard image generation benchmarks, our model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs). Furthermore, our approach rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques, underscoring its potential as a new tool generative modeling.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel generative modeling framework called Acceleration Generative Modeling (AGM), which is grounded in phase space dynamics. The authors leverage insights from Stochastic Optimal Control to construct a path measure in the phase space that enables efficient sampling. The framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation, which sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. The model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs) and rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques.

### Strengths
1. The proposed AGM framework offers a new perspective on accelerating sampling in generative modeling by leveraging additional velocity information.

2. The model demonstrates competitive results compared to diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques, particularly in small NFE settings.

3. The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the AGM framework, its training, and sampling procedures.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper could provide more insights into the potential applications of the AGM framework beyond image generation.

2. The paper could discuss potential improvements to the AGM framework, such as enhancing the training quality through data augmentation, fine-tuned noise scheduling, and network preconditioning.

### Questions
Can the AGM framework be applied to other domains beyond image generation, such as natural language processing or time series data?

### Summary
The papers uses the tools of stochastic optimal control theory to define the forward pass for a kind of generative diffusion model strictly related to Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching. The approach combines the velocity augmentation used in Critical-damped Langevin Dynamics with the bridge approach by solving a linear Gaussian control problem in closed-form. This solution leads to relatively straight paths that are suitable for fast-sampler acceleration both in the stochastic and in the deterministic case. The method has competitive performance for small numbers of functional evaluations, but it lags behind other methods when more evaluations are used (>100).

### Strengths
- The paper uses stochastic control theory effectively in order to construct a forward process with the desired properties. I believe that this is highly promising as optimal control and diffusion modeling are deeply related and many advanced control techniques can be imported in the diffusion literature using a similar approach. 

- The paper provides a rigorous description of the algorithm and the math behind it without requiring an excessive level of mathematical sophistication in the reader. 

- The experiments are rigorous and comprehensive and properly show the performance profile of the method and most relevant baselines under different conditions.

### Weaknesses
- The exposition is rather dense and, as a consequence, the paper is somewhat difficult to read. This is a pity since the underlying concept are rather intuitive and can be understood by a wide audience. 

- As also stated by the authors, the performance of the method is inferior to several baselines for a large number of functional evaluations. However, I do not think that this is a major issue since this class of models are generally designed to work well in the low NFE range, and the results are good in this relevant range. It is quite intuitive to me that there should be a trade off between straight paths and high NFE performance, since the smoothness constraints can limit the expressivity and probabilistic coverage of the method.

### Questions
I find the pseudocode in Algorithm 1 and 2 to be rather uninformative. A good pseudo-code should allow the reader to implement the algorithm almost without referring to the rest of the paper. In this case, the most important parts of the code (e.g. the form of the loss) are omitted. Could you update it to make it more self-contained? 

- The idea of the initial velocity conditioning  is interesting, but it is difficult to evaluate its potential without quantitative results and comparisons. Intuitively, it seems to me that it will likely lead to a substantial drop in diversity. Can you report the FID for the conditional sampler?

### Summary
The work proposes Acceleration Generation Modeling (AGM) as an extension to Critical-damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD) based on the theoretical results of stochastic optimal control. The proposed acceleration term has the effect of straightening the sample trajectories in the sampling process and reducing sampling complexity. The linearity of sampling trajectory enables the AGM generation process to take less number of evaluations and make sampling hops. AGM is compatible with both deterministic (ODE) and stochastic (SDE) samplers. Experiment results on CIFAR-10, AFHQ, and ImageNet show that AGM demonstrate competitive results with less number of evaluations with smaller number of evaluations.

### Strengths
1. Overall speaking, the proposed idea is simple yet effective and the motivation is backed by solid theoretical results in the domain of stochastic optimal control. 
2. Both quantitative and qualitative results support the motivation of AGM. Quantitative results under different settings show AGM is able to achieve competitive or better results with similar to less number of evaluations. Qualitative results also show the better ability of AGM to make sampling hops and recover the denoised images at an early stage compared to CLD. 
3. The presentation of the work is also of high quality. The introduction of the theoretical results is concise but also critical to motivate the proposal of AGM. The rest of Section 3 presenting AGM in technical details is also well-structured and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The work does not have significant weakness. Minor weakness points include
1. The work only shows experiment results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64, and AFHQv2 without scaling to higher resolution images.
2. As the author points out in limitations, AGM is not performing as good as some existing methods especially when the number of evaluations is large. I don't think this is a major weakness as the major benefit of AGM and straight sampling trajectories is the reduced number of evaluations during sampling.

### Questions
In Table 4 which shows experiment results on ImageNet 64, DDPM uses a stochastic sample while the other approaches including FM-OT, MFM, and AGM-ODE all use deterministic samplers. This may not be a fair comparison because even for the same type of diffusion model, the sample quality and sampling efficiency could be very different with different types of sampler and deterministic samplers based on ODE numerical methods generally take less number of steps than stochastic sampler. I would suggest the author include both AGM-SDE and AGM-ODE results under different number of evaluations.

### Summary
This paper proposed the acceleration generative model (AGM), which is Bridge Matching method with a dynamics-based diffusion model with stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory that rectifies the trajectory of the second-order momentum dynamics which is first introduced in CLD. First, the optimal acceleration function is derived to the solution of the stochastic bridge problem, which is given by minimizing the SOC objective function. Different from CLD whose velocity field is defined by the score function of the pre-defined critically-damped Langevin diffusion process, the velocity field of AGM is learned to rectify the particle trajectory. This SOC problem is designed to minimize the distance between the ground-truth (GT) destination and the trajectory destination. Then like in CLD, this paper took advantage of the momentum-based approaches and proposed that the sampling-hop, the estimated data point $x_1$ given the early sampling stage outputs, is predicted more accurately compared to existing methods. In the empirical experiments, the sampling quality is improved especially in the low-NFE regime.

### Strengths
* The idea of rectifying the particle trajectory with the velocity field is an intuitive approach, which is widely used in the literature. Existing works used handcrafted way to design the velocity field, but this paper aimed to both optimize this part of the stochastic process by using the SOC theory.
* The objective is well-defined: when the control regularization term approaches to zero, then the objective directly turns into the square mean
* Even though the velocity should be trained, the whole training process is simulation-free: we do not need any further simulation process like in current SoTA models that require further self-distillation for high-quality image generation in low-NFE regime. Furthermore, this method can be pipelined with the distillation techniques like other diffusion model methods.

### Weaknesses
* The clarity of the paper will be better if the conditions of the Lemmas and Propositions written in this paper is stated more concretely and with full notations, especially in the appendix.
  - In the sampling-hop part, the writing does not fully cover how the sampling-hop is more accurately evaluated compared to the CLD case. Both this method and CLD make predictions of the data from both the current state and the velocity, while the compared EDM (Figure 2) does it from state alone.
  - In the Probabilistic ODE part of (7), an additional notation rather than $g(t)$ is recommended to be used, like $g_t \to h_t$ in the matrix notation and $g(t)=h_t$ for BM-SDE part. Because the notation $g(t)$ or $g_t$ is abused, it can be misleading that the score term of the probabilistic ODE is neglected.
* The SOC theorem is only used limitedly; the regularization in terms of $\int ||a_t||^2$ is ignored and this can threaten the stability of the acceleration space, even though this is not directly revealed in the paper.
* Whereas the theoretical background is sound and the improved performance is guaranteed, the hyperparameters such as the diffusion coefficients and the SDEs are not optimized, which causes its lacking performance compared to EDM (look at Figure 5). However, this is expected to be enlightened with further works.

### Questions
* It will be helpful if the acceleration coefficient $a_t$ for image datasets is depicted, as the momentum of how the image data is being generated in Figure 1 or Figure 2. It is expected that the acceleration coefficients show similar semantic features like $x_t$ and $v_t$, but have varying scales.
* Can you provide elementary introduction of the stochastic optimal control? While this paper works only the simple case of the SOC (no regularization case), introducing some details, or at least some introductory materials will help the readers to follow up the backgrounds.
* I guess that the ImageNet64 performance is not yet optimized: the generative performance of the SoTA models are expected to be much better than the paper have proposed. I think at least the performance should be compared with CLD-SGM from the same architecture.

================================

* It will be helpful for the readers' understanding if you use the colored hyperlinks by reference (\ref) or citation (\cite, \citep, \citet) commands.
