# DEXR: A Unified Approach Towards Environment Agnostic Exploration

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 6

## Abstract
The exploration-exploitation dilemma poses pivotal challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). While recent advances in curiosity-driven techniques have demonstrated capabilities in sparse reward scenarios, they necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on different types of environments and often fall short in dense reward settings. In response to these challenges, we introduce the novel \textbf{D}elayed \textbf{EX}ploration \textbf{R}einforcement Learning (DEXR) framework. DEXR adeptly curbs over-exploration and optimization instabilities issues of curiosity-driven methods, and can efficiently adapt to both dense and sparse reward environments with minimal hyperparameter tuning. This is facilitated by an auxiliary exploitation-only policy that streamlines data collection, guiding the exploration policy towards high-value regions and minimizing unnecessary exploration. Additionally, this exploration policy yields diverse, in-distribution data, and bolsters training robustness with neural network structures. We verify the efficacy of DEXR with both theoretical validations and comprehensive empirical evaluations, demonstrating its superiority in a broad range of environments.

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework for exploration in which the task policy is rolled out first and the exploration policy continues after. This is compared to related work such as rolling exploration first or optimizing a joint objective. There are experiments on continuous control mazes and mujoco tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a straightforward framework that intuitively should work well
- The results are promising

### Weaknesses
- The method is incremental compared to work like Go-Explore.
- There are missing baselines. Specifically, the method is never compared to the same method but without exploration, i.e. the TD3 baseline.

### Questions
Comparing the results to the original TD3 paper seems that the proposed method does not outperform TD3. Furthermore, the baseline exploration methods reported all perform worse than TD3. Why does this happen? Since these methods are implemented on top of TD3 it would be strange if they had worse performance than the backbone RL method without any extrinsic rewards.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new exploration scheme to reduce the sensitivity of exploration hyperparameters across different environments. The new scheme is a two-phased process, starting with a pure exploitative policy and then switching to an exploratory policy at each episode. Specifically, the exploratory policy will try to take over the episode according to a Bernoulli event at each time step. Empirical results on some navigation tasks and MuJoCo controls tasks show consistent performance improvement over baseline algorithms.

### Strengths
The strengths of the paper are its originality and significance. To the best of my knowledge, the idea of the paper is novel. The exploration-exploitation trade-off has been an outstanding issue in reinforcement learning, and the idea of this paper provides a simple but effective way to handle the trade-off. It’s interesting to see how an extra exploitation phase at the beginning of each episode helps deeper exploration, which may be of interest to the broad RL community. 

In addition, the theoretical analysis of DEXR-UCB (LSVI-UCB with DEXR) is somewhat interesting. I suggest the author(s) lay out the condition on the intrinsic motivation reward under which DEXR is theoretically sound, which would make the theoretical results more appealing.

### Weaknesses
In terms of weaknesses, the paper can be improved in its soundness and quality:
1. First of all, Appendix B is still missing, which contains important empirical results to validate the paper's central claim. The paper claims to find an algorithm that has a reduced sensitivity to the exploration hyperparameter. Then, how the algorithm (and baselines) reacts to different values of the exploration hyperparameter should be shown. Also, I think it would be better if it’s in the main text.
2. The effect of the extra hyperparameter, the truncation probability $p$, is not discussed adequately. The paper only mentions that it is set to $1-\gamma$. In addition, there is an annealing of this parameter, which is not mentioned in the main text nor investigated thoroughly.  Are there any justifications for these design choices? 
3. There are still a lot of typos and reference format issues in the paper. Please carefully fix them. See Questions for an unexhausted list.

I will reevaluate the paper if the authors address the above concerns.

### Questions
1. How does $\beta$ influence the performance of each algorithm?
2. Are there any justifications for setting $p$ to $1-\gamma$? Also, why is $p$ annealed to $\frac{1}{H}$ during the course of the training?

Typos and minor suggestions:
1. At the top of page 4, the two $\pi$s seem to be missing a superscript $^{ext}$.
2. In Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 on page 4, $V(s, a)$ should be $V(s)$.
3. It may be a good idea to also define $b$ in the input of Algorithm 1. Otherwise, the reader may be confused if they just read the pseudocode.
4. At the bottom of page 8, “for for” should be “for.”
5. In the first paragraph of page 13, a verb is missing between “then $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}.”
6. There are incorrect or inconsistent reference formats scattered throughout. Please fix them.

### Summary
This paper aims to address the problem that existing approaches to exploration with intrinsic bonuses are highly sensitive to hyperparameters that are used to balance exploration and exploitation.

This paper proposes a framework called DEXR, which can be applied to explore using intrinsic rewards in off-policy settings. Concretely, separate exploration and exploitation policies are maintained, and actions are selected through the exploitative policy till a stochastic truncation point, after which the exploratory policy takes over.

Experiments show that the proposed approach enables learning good policies in fewer samples for a wide range of exploration factors/intrinsic reward coefficients.

### Strengths
**S1.** Using intrinsic rewards is a popular choice for exploring environments with sparse rewards and high-dimensional state spaces. Thus, improving the hyperparameter sensitivity of these approaches and enabling applicability even in dense reward settings would interest RL practitioners.

**S2.** The proposed approach is conceptually simple and easy to integrate with various bonuses and RL algorithms.

### Weaknesses
**W1.** While the proposed approach shows robustness to choices of the intrinsic reward coefficient ($\beta$) in the considered environments, it is currently unclear if this approach would hinder existing curiosity-based approaches in the settings where they have shown significant benefits.

The environments are not the best representation of when curiosity-based approaches succeed. The environments considered are low-dimensional, without a hard-exploration challenge.

While I agree that the maze navigation environment is technically a sparse-reward setting, the considered mazes are ‘simple’ to explore. Even TD-3, without any intrinsic bonus, reliably achieves rewards in three of the four settings and reaches the goal sometimes in the largest maze. Many intrinsic bonus approaches have enabled success in settings where naive exploration (as in standard TD-3)  is far slower and (almost) never succeeds in the considered interactions (e.g., mazes in MiniGrid [1] or hard-exploration atari environments [2]).

**W2.** To properly evaluate the sensitivity of approaches to the intrinsic reward coefficient, further details are needed for how the range for  $\beta$ was selected. For the navigation tasks, only two values of $\beta_s=1$ and $\beta_l=10000$ were selected, and they are extremely wide apart. I have similar concerns for the Mujoco experiments, which use five values of $\beta$ in the same range. Is there a reason why lower values of $\beta$ were not considered?

**W3.** It would also be useful to understand DEXR’s sensitivity to truncation probability p. No results are presented regarding this. 
Further, is there a reason why p is chosen as 1- gamma? 

It would also be better to mention that p is decayed in the main text (not just in the appendix).


**W4.** The paper misses discussions regarding Bayesian RL approaches (see [3] and references within), which can elegantly balance exploration and exploitation without ugly coefficients to balance intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. There also exist some scalable variants (e.g., [4]). 

On a separate note regarding presentation, the paper could be improved by incorporating a separate section for the theoretical results. I also felt that the introduction and the related work section (that immediately follows the introduction) could jointly be compressed as there is quite a bit of overlap between them.

### Questions
Q1. Regarding Figure 2, could the authors explain why DEXR’s exploration is preferable to standard intrinsic motivation? It seems like DEXR would not help in reward-free exploration.

Q2. Since off-policy approaches can be more sample-efficient, I would like to understand if it is possible to use TD-3 + EIPO (instead of PPO) with a similar motivation, i.e., alternating interactions with exploratory and exploitative policies. Or are there other reasons why PPO needs to be used with EIPO?

Q3. Regarding the results presented in Figure 6, are similar figures available for the case where performance is not aggregated across choices of intrinsic reward coefficients ($\beta$)?

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework for handling the exploration-exploitation problem in reinforcement learning. This framework involves an exploitative and exploratory policy, each of which is learnt using off-policy RL using data collected by exploiting in the first few steps of an episode, followed by exploration. The paper suggests that this helps them avoid massively out-of-distribution samples that arise in off-policy RL with random exploration, and leads to superior performance compared to other intrinsic-reward based RL approaches.

### Strengths
- The lower dependence on the success of this approach on the proportion of intrinsic reward (exploration factor $\beta$) demonstrates that the approach is robust to this hyperparameter, which is a key claim made in this paper.
- The results show that the approach works in both sparse and dense reward settings, which is also a key claim made in this paper.
- Figure 8 provides very good intuitive qualitative evidence of how DEXR is more agnostic to $\beta$ than the other baselines; I like how this paper goes beyond the normal learning curves to provide visualisations for their central claims.

### Weaknesses
- The related work section covers important papers, but I felt a key section was missing, the Go-explore family of algorithms. [1] proposed Go-Explore, which I think should be discussed in related work. [2] actually has quite a similar proposition to this paper; there are two policies learnt, one that learns only to exploit and one that learns only to explore. While that is in the meta-RL setup, I think it should be mentioned that there is existing work that has suggested similar ideas, but not from an intrinsic motivation perspective.
- It may also be worth covering temporal abstraction for exploration in RL in related work. For instance, [3] performs exploration at the level of options i.e. at a higher level of temporal abstraction.
- In the results, the paper mentions that DEXR enjoys notably smaller variances compared to DeRL and Exp but that does not seem to be the case (or at least does not seem to be obvious) in Figure 6. Could the authors provide cleaner plots (with only one DEXR, one Exp, and one DeRL variant, instead of the full set of plots)?
- Minor points:
    - Figure 1 has a grey line at the right; it seems to be a screenshot that didn't crop properly?
    - Algorithm 1: DXER -> DEXR
    - Page 6 – board -> broad

### Questions
- If you have the truncation probability, why do you need the horizon $H$ in the algorithm? Is it an implementation detail to ensure that the exploitation phase does not cover a majority of the episode?
- In Figure 6, the results are averaged over 5 random seeds and 5 values of $\beta$. It is not standard practice to average over hyperparameters, so I am curious to know why the authors went with this particular decision. Also, the paper mentions that the split over $\beta$ is in the appendix but I was unable to find it. Could the authors clarify where I can find these results?
- Bonus (not a request for experiments): I'm curious to know if the authors experimented with iterative exploitation-exploration within an episode.
