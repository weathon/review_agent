## Abstract
Learning to reject (L2R) is a classical problem where one seeks a classifier capable of abstaining on low-confidence samples. Most prior work on L2R has focused on minimizing the standard misclassification error. However, in many real-world applications, the label distribution is highly imbalanced,  necessitating alternate evaluation metrics such as the balanced error or the worst-group error that enforce equitable performance across both the head and tail classes. In this paper, we establish that traditional L2R methods can be grossly sub-optimal for such metrics, and show that this is due to an intricate  dependence in the objective between the label costs and the rejector. We then derive the form of the Bayes-optimal classifier and rejector for the balanced error, propose a novel plug-in approach to mimic this solution, and extend our results to general evaluation metrics. Through experiments on benchmark  image classification tasks, we show that our approach yields better trade-offs in both the balanced and worst-group error compared to L2R baselines.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper works on learning to reject (L2R) under long-tailed scenarios. They find that Chow's rule is suboptimal for this setting and propose a new approach with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The paper is very well written. Even those unfamiliar with L2R can easily understand the setting.
- The setting is novel and meaningful, since the long-tailed setting is quite common but rarely studied in the context of L2R.
- The proposed method is novel and interesting, and the theoretical results are not trivial.

### Weaknesses
- If I understand correctly, the solution of the optimization problem in equation (9) seems to be heuristic. Is $\mu$ not optimized, but selected from a predefined set? I am afraid that such solutions may not lead to an optimal solution. Will the authors provide some theoretical or empirical analysis of this problem and prove that the solution can be close to optimal?

- What is the candidate value of $\mu$? The authors say that they propose to do a grid search over $\mu$, but what's the search space? If the search space is very large, the speed of the algorithm may be slow.

- In the experimental section, only two compared methods are used. I am not sure if more compared methods are needed to validate the effectiveness of the proposal.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of classification with rejection when data distribution is long-tailed. In this case, metrics considering the data distribution such as balanced error is more appropriate than traditional misclassification error. For the case when learning a classifier and a separate rejector, authors derive corresponding Bayes optimal solutions for the problem setting, showing many existing methods are not optimal for metrics such as balanced error. Authors then propose a modification method based on the derived Bayes optimal solution, and empirically show its superiority.

### Strengths
- The paper considers an important problem setting combination, learning with rejection and class-imbalanced distribution.
- The analysis is rigorously conducted with high quality and significance.
- The paper is overall well structured and well written. It is easy and joyful to follow.
- The paper provide appropriate literature reivew for related work.

### Weaknesses
Limit of the proposed framwork is not properly addressed. For example, are there any popular metrics not covered?

### Questions
This paper considers the learning setting where a classifer and a separate rejector function exist. There is also another framework learning solely one classifier and later uses its output distribution over labels to conduct abstention. Is it impossible for this approach to derive Baye optimal solutions, or it is simply not the scope of the paper?

### Summary
This paper derives and examines the Bayes optimal solution to minimizing the balanced error metric when a reject option is available (rejection is assumed to have a fixed cost). This problem is much more challenging than learning to reject for plain error because, as the authors show, the rejection thresholds for the various classes are coupled. Moreover, no reduction to cost sensitive learning with fixed per-class misclassification costs exist, since these costs change depending on the fraction of examples in each class not rejected.

Given the challenges, the authors present an approximate scheme for minimizing balanced-error with a reject option, and they compare its effectiveness to recent methods for learning to reject on 3 image classification datasets. The proposed method out-performs or matches the compared-to methods across all datasets.

Additionally, the authors formulate the Bayes optimal solution for minimum balanced error rate with rejection to one for any metric that is a function of the per-class error rates. This allows for minimizing the maximum per-class error rate, and the G-mean metric; as well as for balancing error rates across an arbitrary partition of classes -- e.g., balancing the error rate across the set of frequent classes and the tail classes.

### Strengths
This is the first paper to formulate the Bayes optimal solution for minimum balanced error classification with a rejection option, and to provide a means of optimizing it. The problem itself is rather significant since there are high stakes scenarios in which it's desirable for a classifier to perform equally well across groups, and for a rejection or abstention option to be available so that cases can be escalated to humans for more careful consideration.

The experiments reasonably demonstrate the method's effectiveness, and the authors generalize the form of the given solution to metrics other than balanced accuracy.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of this paper is that the proposed optimization scheme is only approximate and an analysis of the gap is not given. Is it possible to say how much grid search over the space of lagrange multiplers is needed to find a good solution? Also, the proposed optimization scheme finds a fixed point of the alpha parameters for given values of lagrange multipliers. But is this fixed point unique? And if not, are they all equally good? These questions are not addressed in the paper.

### Summary
The manuscript considers the problem of learning optimal classifiers with reject option, i.e., there's a certain budget, and a fixed cost, for refraining from making any predictions on test instances. The problem of 'learning to reject' has been studied before, but mostly in the setting when the performance metric of interest is classification accuracy (or 0-1 loss). In this work, the authors consider more general and practical performance measures, balanced error and worst-group error in particular. The authors derive Bayes optimal classifiers (and rejectors) for the general measures, and provide a practical algorithm for estimating them with samples. 

Two key contributions: 1) Clear formulations of the learning to reject problem, various metrics of interest, and deriving Bayes optimal forms for the different metrics. While general performance measures have been considered before in different supervised learning settings, deriving general results for classifiers with reject option is novel as far as I can tell. 2) Algorithm for estimating the classifiers and rejectors in practice for general performance measures, and supportive empirical results on standard datasets.

Overall, I find the paper to be sufficiently interesting to any ML audience, with technical depth and contributions par for the venue. I've some questions for the authors listed below, but the paper is a clear accept for me.

### Strengths
As I mentioned in my summary the paper makes key contributions, and each of the contributions involves good technical rigor and presentation which I very much appreciate: 1) Clear formulations of the learning to reject problem, various metrics of interest, and deriving Bayes optimal forms for the different metrics. While general performance measures have been considered before in different supervised learning settings, deriving general results for classifiers with reject option is novel as far as I can tell. 2) Algorithm for estimating the classifiers and rejectors in practice for general performance measures, and supportive empirical results on standard datasets.

The paper is well-written, ideas flow coherently, related results are placed well in context, and it was a pleasure to read!

### Weaknesses
These are more nit picks than weaknesses.
1. Some intuitive justification for the Bayes optimal forms would have been useful. As it stands, the material is somewhat dense, and for a reader outside the area, some of these results might be confusing. For instance, I would love to know if there's an intuitive explanation for the 'discount' factor $-\mu^*_{[y']}$ in (2). 
2. I found it a bit of a leap to go from deterministic classifiers in Theorem 2 to stochastic classifiers in Theorem 5. Balanced error does involve weights that are distribution dependent, while general $\psi$ metrics studied in Theorem 5 I believe are functions that do not depend on the distribution in any way other than via the arguments $e_j(h,r)$'s. So where is the stochasticity arising from? Also, it would be good to draw corollaries where for some simple forms of \psi functions, you indeed get deterministic classifiers and rejectors (when $h^{(1)} = h^{(2)}$ holds, etc.)

### Questions
I would like the authors to address the questions in the 'weaknessess' section in their rebuttal.
