# End-to-end Story Plot Generator

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 1, 5

## Abstract
Story plots, while short, carry most of the essential information of a full story that may contain tens of thousands of words. We study the problem of automatic generation of story plots, which includes story premise, character descriptions, plot outlines, etc. To generate a single engaging plot, existing plot generators (e.g., DOC (Yang et al., 2022a)) require hundreds to thousands of calls to LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API) in the planning stage of the story plot, which is costly and takes at least several minutes. Moreover, the hard-wired nature of the method makes the pipeline non-differentiable, blocking fast specialization and personalization of the plot generator. In this paper, we overcome these issues with an end-to-end story plot generator, which is (1) faster and cheaper to generate and (2) end-to-end fine-tunable with human feedback. Compared to DOC, our work replaces expensive OpenAI API calls with Llama2 models via careful prompt designs, which leads to the cheap generation of high-quality training datasets. We then perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using approximately 13000 story plots to obtain an end-to-end model. The end-to-end model can generate story plots of comparable quality to the previous DOC method and is $>10\times$ faster (1k tokens in only 30 seconds on average). Furthermore, fine-tuned with RLHF on several different reward models for different aspects of story quality, our model achieves 60.0\% winning rate against the model after SFT in the aspect of suspense and surprise.

### Summary
This paper introduces an end-to-end model for the task of (text) story plot generation. The authors first replicate a previous model for story generation (DOC) with open-source architectures and show challenges and fixes to overcome some of the challenges in the transition. Then, they use this model to create a large number of story plots that are then used to fine-tune another, 7B model for this task, showing competitive performance (according to GPT-4) with the teacher model. Finally, the authors collect human preferences from plots generated with the same premise and further tune the fine-tuned model with RLHF, resulting in better performance across 5 metrics (again, according to GPT-4).

### Strengths
1. The task of story plot generation is interesting and allows to disentangle two major phases of content creation often seen in humans: planning and coarse-to-fine generation
2. The authors show the intricacies of adapting a previous model from closed-source APIs to open-source alternatives that do not have the same capabilities (completion/infilling vs. chat)
3. The authors can train a 7B model that is relatively fast and seems to generate stories of similar quality as a 13B model that follows the original protocol with 100s of calls.
4. The paper is well written and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
1. My major concern is the lack of human evaluation. The authors state multiple times that “story plot is relatively short and thus easy for humans to evaluate” yet perform no human evaluation. Relying solely on a model like GPT-4 for such a complex task is, in my opinion, a major limitation to the soundness of the claims. I hence invite the authors to pair the main evaluations (ie Table 5 and 6) with human evaluation. I will then happily advocate for acceptance.
2. Another minor limitation is that RLHF results in 5 different models, which are each compared against a single SFT model. Could the authors consider combining the different rewards into a single RLHF model and then ask humans to compare it against SFT according to the metrics Q1-6?

---
Rebuttal: The authors added human evaluation, and said that (2) is a direction for future work.

### Questions
1. The Related Work section is comprehensive. To make the paper’s scope broader and linked to work in the computer vision and multimodal communities, I would recommend adding a brief paragraph on work in story generation for image-to-text [1], text-to-image [2] and text-to-video [3] tasks.
2. Are the results in Table 4 a “validation” of the same RLHF training story plots?
3. In page 2, when you say “a completion model which accepts a suffix” I was not entirely sure what you meant. It then became clear later throughout the paper. I recommend adding a brief explanation that you mean a model that can do text infilling given a text prefix and a text suffix, and cite [4].
4. Line 3 of Sec 3 should reference Table 7, not Table 1.
5. First line of Sec 3.2 might make it explicit that the RLHF results in 5 models.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper attempts to replicate the story outline generation by DOC (Yang et al. 2022a), which makes use of GPT-3. Instead, this paper replaces GPT-3 with the opensource Llama2-13B. In addition, it performs an end-to-end finetuning on Llama2-7B, achieving speedup over repeated API calls. Finally, it performs RLHF on a collected dataset of human feedback.

Given the low-quality author response, I decided to lower my score to strong reject.

### Strengths
The paper is generally well written, if missing a few technical definitions here and there. 

The speed-up in Table 1 is significant. 

The human comparison data of the 7000 story pairs would be quite interesting, if released.

### Weaknesses
For someone who is familiar with DOC and LLMs, the paper does not seem to offer any new insight or new knowledge. Yes, Llama-2 and GPT-3 can do roughly the same things. Yes, we can use a supervisedly finetuned model to replace repeated LLM calls. Yes, we can do RLHF. All these are common knowledge. Hence, it may seem that the paper does not make a real scientific contribution. It may be an interesting engineering effort, but may not qualify as a scientific publication. 

The decision to use GPT-4 as the evalution for final story quality seems dubious. The paper has not offered any evidence that GPT-4 is good at the task. The paper makes the claim that the RLHF stories are better at suspense and surprise. However, do we know if GPT-4 is good at detecting suspense or surprise? 

Since the author has spent significant effort to collect human ratings on 7000 story pairs, why not do another 300 pairs? This would create a much more solid evaluation. 

How is story generation different from other forms of structured text generation, such as poetry or argumentative essays? The paper has used specific prompts to handle aspects of stories such as characters or settings. But it is not explicit that if there is any principle behind the writing of these prompts or if they solely rely on trial and error by the paper authors. This goes back to the question: what is it that we can learn from this paper?

Minor comments:

Section 2.1.1 The authors do not define what is meant by "supports suffix". I managed to guess the meaning from the context but it created temporary confusion. 

The authors make several claims about how humans supposedly do things. Humans write stories in a specific way (Page 2, Paragarph 2). Humans write from coarse to fine (Challenge 1). However, these claims are unsubstantiated.

### Questions
- What novel or surprising scientific insights or findings are reported by this paper?
- What evidence can support the claim that humans write stories by first planning an outline?

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of automatic generation of story plots intended as a record of story premise, character descriptions, and sequence of plot elements. It purports to use LLMs for plot generation and considers limitations of state of the art systems such as DOC (Yang et al., 2022a)) in particular in their requirement for large number of calls to LLMs. 
The work implements an end-to-end story plot generator, which replaces Open AI (as used in DOC) with Llama2-13B-chat and is fine-tunable with human feedback. The generator is based on on a two-level hierarchy (where DOC supports different numbers of levels for the hierarchical outline) and operates in a breadth-first and coarse-to-fine manner. The system has been evaluated using an evaluation prompt in GPT4, showing that (after using RLHF and SFT) it outperforms DOC in a majority of cases.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a difficult problem, which has a long history in AI and to which the advent of LLM offers new perspectives. It contains an appropriate rationale and demonstrate a reasonable knowledge of the state-of-the-art (to the exception of pre-2018 plan-based narrative generation). Experimental design is overall well described, leading to end-to-end model training.
While aiming at replicate and extend the performance of an existing approach (DOC) the work contains a number of original aspects (experimental approach, evaluation). 
The paper also includes a transparent account of prompt engineering aspects faced during the development of the work, which might be beneficial to readers.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper describes generated units as 'plots' it stands in-between substantial previous work of Plan-based plot generation [Riedel and Young, 2010] where plot elements were narrative functions or operators and text-based story generation [Wang and Wan, 2019] (in the paper's references), originating in story completion experiments, up to systems to which the approach is compared that generate plot + narrative text [Yang et al., 2023 (2022a in the paper's references)]. It is thus unclear whether what is presented in the paper, in particular in Figure 7 are plots or storyboards, and this is not just a terminological issue, as it affects the ability to apply structural evaluation methods to plots (see below) as well as creating an unusual setting for users to 'evaluate' the plot as opposed to evaluation methods based on end-story quality or story understanding (e.g. QUEST graphs [Graesser et al., 1992] used in [Christian and Young, 2004]). 
It would thus be necessary to much better justify the approach compared to end-story text generation (not just completion), or non-DL, non-LLM based plot generation (e.g. Plan-based).  In particular, considering that LLM text generation could be used in conjunction to other plot/backbone generation methods, or that the DOC method is in reality generating both plot and (textual) narrative. 

Regarding reward models, there should probably be a discussion of previous approaches in text-based narrative generation, for instance [Ammanabrolu et al., 2019] and [Castricato et al., 2022]. There is also a lack of details on how RLHF has actually been performed (no details in the supplementary materials). 

Evaluation techniques are somehow underspecified considering previous work in evaluating narrative generation. The expression of comparative preferences by GPT4 is moderately replicable and appears rather qualitative and not sufficiently related to structural properties of the plot and rigorous definitions of the above properties. 
Although most of the work on evaluation based on narrative criteria (suspense, surprise, narrative arc...) has been developed as part of Plan-based narrative generation [Bae and Young, 2013] [Doust and Piwek, 2017] it should be transposable to DL-based (text-based [Yao et al., 2019] - in the paper's references, plot backbone [Polceanu et al., 2021]) or LLM-based work. Visual aspects of Plot structures that reconstruct Aristotelian arcs are of particular interest [Leong et al., 2022], not least because the paper makes reference [Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020] to similar principles for neural-based story generation. In the absence of formal models it seems difficult to rely on GPT-4 with generic evaluation prompts, meaning that plots or storyboards would be better evaluated by industry professionals [Mirowski et al., 2022] (in the paper's references). 
Other related work is not discussed [Xie et al., 2023], although it may have been released too late considering the ICLR deadline.
