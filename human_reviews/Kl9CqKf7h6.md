## Abstract
The theoretical landscape of federated learning (FL) undergoes rapid evolution, but its practical application encounters a series of intricate challenges, and hyperparameter optimization is one of these critical challenges. Amongst the diverse adjustments in hyperparameters, the adaptation of the learning rate emerges as a crucial component, holding the promise of significantly enhancing the efficacy of FL systems. In response to this critical need, this paper presents FedHyper, a novel hypergradient-based learning rate adaptation algorithm specifically designed for FL. FedHyper serves as a universal learning rate scheduler that can adapt both global and local rates as the training progresses. In addition, FedHyper not only showcases unparalleled robustness to a spectrum of initial learning rate configurations but also significantly alleviates the necessity for laborious empirical learning rate adjustments. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedHyper’s convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on vision and language benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that FEDHYPER consistently converges 1.1-3× faster than FedAvg and the competing baselines while achieving superior final accuracy. Moreover, FEDHYPER catalyzes a remarkable surge in accuracy, augmenting it by up to 15% compared to FedAvg under suboptimal initial learning rate settings.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes FedHyper, which adopts Hypergradients to dynamically adjust learning rate for global learning rate (LR), server-side local LR, and client-side local LR. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of FedHyper on various datasets and models, including image classification and language modeling tasks. FedHyper is shown to outperform other FL learning rate scheduling algorithms in terms of convergence rate and final accuracy on various datasets and models.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with clear explanations and well-designed experiments. FEDHYPER is a versatile algorithm that can seamlessly integrate with and augment the performance of existing optimization algorithms. This versatility makes it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working in the field of FL.

### Weaknesses
The proposed FedHyper highly relies on the existing method, i.e., hypergradient. It's unclear why the learning rate can be updated following Eq. (4-5). It would be better to give the intuitive explanation for this. FedHyper does not discuss the issue of training cost in FL.

### Questions
- Why are the baseline methods different for the three settings in Figure 3?
- Could you please provide a more detailed and intuitive explanation of hypergradients? I’m looking for a thorough understanding, and I’m willing to give a higher score for a comprehensive explanation.
- Is the learning rate fixed for baseline methods like FedAvg?
- Since FedHyper requires updating the learning rate using current and previous time gradients, does it incur significantly higher computational and resource costs compared to other baseline methods?

### Summary
This paper introduces FedHyper, a novel learning rate scheduler adept at managing both global and local learning rates. FedHyper distinguishes itself by accelerating convergence and automating learning rate adjustments. To validate FedHyper's efficacy, the authors perform thorough experiments on benchmark datasets, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.

### Strengths
1) The paper addresses a significant issue in Federated Learning (FL) by emphasizing the pivotal role of learning rate scheduling. It successfully argues the necessity for meticulous attention in this area and proposes pragmatic solutions, thereby contributing tangibly to advancements in FL.
2) The adoption of the hypergradient method within this context is noteworthy. Its proven effectiveness in FL not only reinforces the method's utility but also broadens its appeal, suggesting it could be beneficial in a variety of other areas. This aspect of the paper stands out as particularly insightful.
3) The experimental framework of the paper is commendable for its solidity. By utilizing benchmark datasets, the research provides ample evidence to support the stated contributions of FedHyper. This rigorous approach to experimentation substantiates the claims made, enhancing the paper's credibility.

### Weaknesses
1) One concern is the lack of empirical evidence supporting the client-side scheduler's strategy of employing a global model update to limit the growth of the local learning rate. The paper would greatly benefit from an ablation study to confirm the validity of this approach, ensuring that the strategy is both necessary and effective.
2) The analysis seems incomplete when it comes to comparing FedHyper with FedAdam. The latter, considered a baseline, is conspicuously missing from the "performance of FedHyper" section after being included in the cooperation analysis. The reason for this omission is unclear, and it restricts a full understanding of how FedHyper stands against established methods.
3) The paper falls short in explaining the underlying reasons behind FedHyper's superior ability to fine-tune learning rates compared to its contemporaries, such as FedExp. The missing intuitive rationale or clear justification leaves the reader questioning why FedHyper is ostensibly more efficient. Addressing this would make the advantages of FedHyper more transparent and convincing.

### Summary
This paper aims to introduce a structured approach to learning rate scheduling within the realm of Federated Learning, a critical step that enhances efficiency, particularly in the initialization phase. The authors present FedHyper, a framework that leverages hypergradient methods to adjust learning rates based on the inner product of gradients. FedHyper encompasses three distinct schedulers for comprehensive application: a global scheduler for the server-side learning rate, a server-side local scheduler, and a client-side local scheduler. Through rigorous testing on three datasets, FedHyper demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths
- By targeting a pivotal issue in Federated Learning, the study positions itself within a crucial niche. The focus on optimizing learning rate scheduling addresses a substantive bottleneck in the field, underlining the paper's relevance.
- The hypergradient method is interesting and effective, and the proposed method could be applied to other hyperparameters as well. Simplicity and practicality are the hallmarks of the proposed scheduler, making it an attractive tool for real-world application. Its ease of use could significantly benefit practitioners in the field.
- The convergence of FedHyper is theoretically proofed, making this work more sound.
- The results from extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvement in both convergence rate and final accuracy.
- The paper excels in clarity and accessibility, effectively illustrating the mechanics of hypergradient descent in learning rate scheduling through well-conceptualized figures (e.g., Figures 1 and 2).

### Weaknesses
- The paper's primary methodology involves utilizing the inner product of gradients to modify the learning rate, a technique that potentially incurs additional computational expenses compared to the more basic FedAvg. The study falls short by not evaluating or discussing these potential overheads, leaving the reader uncertain about the practical trade-offs.
- In FedHyper-CL, the author’s statement “directly applying Eq. (19) to local learning rates can lead to an imbalance in learning rates across clients” is not well supported by analysis or reference. So, the motivation of adding an item in FedHyper-CL is not clear.
- The paper does not provide the direct comparison with FedAdam.

### Summary
This work extends the traditional hypergradient learning rate scheduler to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, the authors propose a novel theoretical framework that jointly considers the global and local learning rates with respect to global and local updates. The authors have conducted sufficient experiments to validate the performance.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written. The authors thoroughly reviewed the previously related work, hypergradient, and discussed the limitations of the work in detail. Then the authors naturally extended the method into federated learning scenarios.

2. The proposed method is intuitive, and the theoretical guarantee is solid.

3. The authors have conducted sufficient experiments to validate the proposed methods and discussed the suitability of several variants under different hardware constraints.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method is only evaluated on simple datasets and tasks, such as CIFAR-10 and FMNIST, and tested with small models. The hyperparameter choices for these simple scenarios would be relatively straightforward, particularly in the case of standard centralized training. It would be beneficial if the authors could test the performance improvements on more challenging cases, such as unbalanced or large datasets, or in fine-tuning settings.

### Questions
FedHyper-SL and FedHyper-G appear to update different sets of hyperparameters using the same gradients. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a more detailed comparison between these two variants, considering that FedHyper-G seems to be a special case of FedHyper-SL.
