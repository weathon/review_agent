# Vlearn: Off-Policy Learning with Efficient State-Value Function Estimation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Existing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms typically necessitate an explicit state-action-value function representation, which becomes problematic in high-dimensional action spaces. 
These algorithms often encounter challenges where they struggle with the curse of dimensionality, as maintaining a state-action-value function in such spaces becomes data-inefficient.
In this work, we propose a novel off-policy trust region optimization approach, called Vlearn, that eliminates the requirement for an explicit state-action-value function. 
Instead, we demonstrate how to efficiently leverage just a state-value function as the critic, thus overcoming several limitations of existing methods. 
By doing so, Vlearn addresses the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional action spaces. 
Furthermore, Vlearn introduces an efficient approach to address the challenges associated with pure state-value function learning in the off-policy setting. 
This approach not only simplifies the implementation of off-policy policy gradient algorithms but also leads to consistent and robust performance across various benchmark tasks. 
Specifically, by removing the need for a state-action-value function Vlearn simplifies the learning process and allows for more efficient exploration and exploitation in complex environments.

### Summary
Valued-based RL typically aims to learn the Q-function ("action value function"), which maps state-action pair to a Q-value. The complexity of this approach doesn't scale well with high-dimensional action space. Instead, this work proposes to learn the V-function ("state value function"). There's a some description of the mathematical foundation for the proposed loss function and algorithm. 

Experiments were conducted on continuous control tasks including gym (mujoco) and DeepMind control suite.

### Strengths
- Strong empirical performance in the experiments, especially compared to V-trace, which shares a similar mathematical formulation as the proposed approach Vlearn.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of mathematical rigor in the algorithm description (see questions below)
- An important connection to a particular piece of prior work seems to be obscured in the paper as written

### Questions
- Issues with mathematical notation
  - In eqn (2) and the eqn right above eqn (4): what is $j$, what is the sum over $j$, and what is $K$? Below eqn (2), the text says "$a_{t,j}$ defines the $j$th action in state $s_t$". Does this mean $j$ is enumerating the collected transitions (presumably in a buffer)? Or is this following some other distribution - what distribution would that be? 
  - In eqn (4), since you are no longer summing over $j$, do you still need $\frac{1}{K}$? 
  - Right above eqn (3), could you clarify what "upper bound" and "lower bound" this sentence is referring to, and why "truncated importance weights can provide an upper bound"? 
- The introduction mentions "upper bounds of actual Bellman error" - I assume this is referring to eqn (4) - however it was not explicitly stated around eqn (4). 
  - How was Jensen's inequality used to derive eqn (4) from eqn (2)? Could walk through this explicitly. 
- Connection to Mahmood et al. 2014
  - In that referenced paper, the authors considered linear function approx setting and presented two importance sampling approaches for off-policy learning. 
  - What they call OIS-LS and WIS-LS seems to correspond to the difference between eqn (2) vs eqn (4). Specifically, their WIS-LS objective is $J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_k \rho_k (Y - \theta^{\intercal} \phi_k)$, which basically corresponds to eqn (4) of this paper $L(\theta) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{t} \rho_t (V_\theta(s_t) - (r_t + \gamma V_{\bar{\theta}}(s_{t+1}))^2$ except now $V_\theta$ is used in place of a linear function. 
  - The core idea of the current proposed approach seems to be simply extending the linear case to general function approximation. Is there any other difference? Either way, this connection should be explicitly stated, perhaps citing the mathematical formulation as well. Of course, I understand the prior work did not consider any continuous control benchmarks, and the contribution of this work is still valuable. But I believe the connection should be made clear. 
- The conclusion states "proposed a novel approach applying trust region methods in the off-policy setting" -- is that the main contribution? Or is learning V-function instead of Q-function the contribution. 

Minor issues: 
- typo on page 4 paragraph 2 "Bellmann" -> "Bellman"
- typo on page 6 "populate]"
- typo on page 8 conclusion "an novel approach" -> "a novel approach"

### Summary
This paper proposes a new objective to estimate the state value function in off-policy setting. The new objective modifies the importance-weighted value iteration objective by a) moving the importance weights to the outside of the squared loss and b) subsuming the per-action weights to the summation over the time horizon. This state value estimation method is then combined with many other RL practice, including using the target network, applying trust region constraint, truncating the importance ratios etc, to form a new algorithm. The paper empirically evaluates this new algorithm in control tasks.

### Strengths
The paper is well written, with a clear statement of the research question. The related work also summarizes well the on-policy and off-policy methods. The use of a trust-region method to stabilize the training and the policy update is also convincing and turns out be to working well in empirical experiments.

### Weaknesses
### Clarity & quality
**Important details on the value loss function are missing and unclear**: 

The main contribution of this is the use of a surrogate objective for the value function learning. However, the deduction of this new surrogate objective lacks important explanations. 
1. “accomplish this by relaxing the squared loss function from Equation 2 using Jensen’s inequality”. It is not straightforward to me how to use Jensen’s inequality to obtain $L(\theta)$. Why we can move the ratios just outside of the square? 
2.  In Equation (4), the paper just subsumes the summation over $j$ into the sum over $t$. I’m not sure quite how this can be done, given that the summation over $j$ “implicitly assumes multiple action executions per state”. But the $L(\theta)$ in Equation (4) clearly does not have such implicit assumption. Further, in the subsequent sections, there is no discussion on this, and Algorithm 1 just presents a single-action estimate for the loss. 

### Significance
**Some conclusions and statements may need to be further justified**
1. **the conclusion from the cited work may not carry over straightaway to the value estimation in this paper**. Specifically, “the new loss function is an upper bound of the original loss function and shares the same optima”. However, in the cited work (Neumann & Peters, 2008), the proof is for the value estimation of $\pi$ with a given Q and samples generated by the same policy (if I understand correctly). This is different from objective function in Equation (4), which is estimated using target networks and the off-policy samples.  Can the authors provide a theoretical proof for this convergence to the same optima? Also, regarding “solving the relaxed loss should yield results consistent with the original loss”, does it mean that the final loss will be consistent? Or the final policy will be the same? 

2. **It is unclear how the proposed state-value-estimation can be useful for the algorithm**: Particularly, the proposed algorithm is a combination of the multiple independent ideas: state value estimation, target networks, trust region projection, Gaussian policy approximation, replay buffer and importance weight truncation. Any of these ideas can be crucial and contributive for the strong empirical performance. It would be hard to detach the state value estimation from the other components and claim that the proposed state value estimation is the key. 
  
3. **Further empirical studies are needed to verify the proposed idea**: the main empirical results only show the evaluation reward/returns for the trained policies. They are insufficient to show if the proposed value estimation objective can be better in learning an accurate value estimate. Particular, those strong performance of Vlean can be (very likely) a result from other implementation tricks. The paper should consider using Monte Carlo estimate to compare the estimated values with Vlean and the groundtruth values. Moreover, the ablation studies on the replay buffer size are irrelevant to the main idea of the proposed value estimate and should be substituted with a more informative study, e.g., with/without the ratios when optimization $L(\theta)$. The current ablation studies give no clue on the state-value-function estimation.

### Questions
1. The paper states that “we aim to reduce the variance by replacing the standard importance sampling ratio with truncated importance sampling”. But Algorithm 1 has no such ratio clipping 

Some language issues (those do not affect my assessment): 
1. “This loss from Equation 5 can be optimized” Equation 5 is not a loss, but an objective to maximize.

### Summary
This paper provides an off-policy trust region method that using only V to learn the optimal policy. In details, this paper proposes some modification (an uppper bound learning objective) to V-trace, and learns the policy by TRPL. Vlearn is claimed to bring more efficient exploration and exploitation in complex tasks with high-dimensional action spaces. This paper tests Vlearn on both Gymnasium and DMC dog tasks, Vlearn achieves strong results across all tasks, especially on 38-dimensional dog tasks.

### Strengths
- Empirical results are strong, Vlearn achieves strong results on high-dimensional gym tasks and DMC dog tasks.
- Vlearn extends ppo (or TRPL) to off-policy methods, which is of good significance.

### Weaknesses
- Why does the learning objective in Vlearn work better than 1-step V-trace is still not clear to me. Despite the empirical results, it will be more sound if the author could give some (theoritical) analysis to it.
- Although Vlearn only needs to learn V so as to bypass the problem in explicitly learning Q function representation, it seems will bring the  problem to the estimate of $\frac{\pi(a|s)}{\pi_b(a|s)}$ if the action space is high-dimensional.
- Empirical results on easy, low-dimension task such as hopper, walker, cheetah are low.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning method called Vlearn that only learns a state-value function for advantage estimation to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in tasks with large action spaces. The algorithm is based on a state-value function loss upper bound of one that multiplies the importance sampling ratio with the Bellman target. Vlearn leverages an experience replay memory for data efficiency and employs delayed update, double-Q-learning-like training, importance sampling ratio truncation, and trust region optimization for stability.

The experiments done on the Gymnasium and DMC environments demonstrate a competitive performance of Vlearn on most of the continuous control tasks. Vlearn exhibits an impressive performance on the DMC dog tasks that previous methods struggled to learn. The empirical study concludes with an ablation study on the effect of the size of the replay buffer on the algorithm.

### Strengths
- The motivation for this work is easy to understand. The authors straightforwardly introduce the problem they are trying to solve and explain why it is important.
- The background material is abundant and comprehensive, crediting the proper related works.
- The experiments demonstrate the strength of VLearn in high-dimensional action space tasks compared to a fair selection of competitors.

### Weaknesses
- The derivation skips directly to the final equation, not providing enough detail. It's also possibly erroneous. Please see the question section.
- Some equations and parts of the pseudocode are difficult to understand due to poor explanation of the notations. I will point out some examples in the question section.
- The ablation study only investigates the effect of the size of the replay buffer. However, Vlearn uses multiple techniques from previous works, e.g., importance sampling ratio truncation. Each of them may contribute to the reported final performance. A more comprehensive ablation study can definitely enhance the value of this work.

### Questions
- I tried to justify how the authors arrived at equation 4 from equation 2 using Jensen's inequality but failed. I hope the authors can explain how Jensen's inequality is applied here. The importance sampling ratios do not necessarily sum to one. Thus, the inequality may not hold.
- Some notations are used before definition. For example, I was unsure what $K$ represents until I got to the pseudocode to find out it was the mini-batch size.
- The pseudocode is somewhat vague. For instance, does the for $ i \in \\{1,2\\}$ indicate a for-loop or a random sample from the set in lines 9 and 13? What does $\theta$ in line 11 represent? It's not in the input to the algorithm.
- What is the motivation behind using two sets of parameters for the state-value function? The overestimation bias exists in Q-learning. I don't think it exists in the authors' formulation.
