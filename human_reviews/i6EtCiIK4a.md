## Abstract
Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) has found diverse applications in machine learning due to its ability to model nested structures. Addressing large-scale BLO problems for complex learning tasks presents two significant challenges: ensuring computational efficiency and providing theoretical guarantees. Recent advancements in scalable BLO algorithms has predominantly relied on lower-level convexity simplification. In this context, our work takes on the challenge of large-scale BLO problems involving nonconvexity in both the upper and lower levels. We address both computational and theoretical challenges simultaneously. Specifically, by utilizing the Moreau envelope-based reformulation, we introduce an innovative single-loop gradient-based algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence analysis for general nonconvex BLO problems. Notably, this algorithm relies solely on first-order gradient information, making it exceedingly practical and efficient, particularly for large-scale BLO learning tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a series of different synthetic problems,  two typicial hyper-parameter learning tasks and the real-world neural architecture search application. These experiments collectively substantiate the superior performance of our method.

### Summary
This paper proposes a stochastic first-order algorithm based on the Moreau envelope reformulation.  Non-asymptotic convergence analysis under weaker conditions than previous works is provided. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on various setups, including few-shot learning, data hyper-cleaning, and neural architecture search.

### Strengths
1. The method looks novel.
2. Experiments look good.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the assumptions are indeed weaker than previous works, the convergence measure is also different from many previous works, so the results may not be directly comparable.
2. I think the recent paper which has a strong theoretical guarantee should be cited.

### Summary
This paper concerns bi-level optimization (BLO) problems with an inner constraint set. By introducing the Moreau envelope of the lower-level function, the BLO can be reformulated into a nonconvex optimization problem with a smooth constraint. A single loop algorithm is proposed based on the formulation, leveraging the structure of the Moreau envelope. The author also provides a non-asymptotic rate for the algorithm and conducts numerical experiments to show its superiority.

### Strengths
1. The application of the Moreau envelope gives a nice reformation for the BLO. Compared with traditional value function reformation, the Moreau envelope-based reformation is a smooth problem and easier to solve.

2. Non-asymptotic convergence rate is developed for the proposed method without using the PL condition.

### Weaknesses
1. In the nonconvex case, (4) is only a relaxed version of the original BLO. Is not clear whether the global optimal solutions, local optimal solutions, and stationary points of (4) are related to the original BLO. Hence, I am not sure whether the stationarity measure in this paper is useful.

2. Assumption 3.2 (ii) appears too technical and artificial. The author does not convince me of its practicability, because the given examples are simple and no theoretical results is ensuring Assumption 3.2 (ii).

3. In Theorem 3.1, it is strange to say that "there exists c_{\alpha},c_{\beta}>0" as the upper bounds of the stepsizes $\alpha_k,\beta_k$. This appears to be impractical since only the existence of $c_{\alpha},c_{\beta}$ does not suggest how to choose the right stepsizes in implementation.

### Questions
Do the models in the experiments satisfy the Assumptions previously assumed?

### Summary
This paper studied the nonconvex constrained bilevel optimization, where its upper level is nonconvex and its lower level is nonsmooth and weakly convex. It proposed an efficient single-loop gradient-based Hessian-free algorithm based on the Moreau envelope technique. Moreover, it provided the non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In summary, the contributions of this paper are significant on the design method and solid convergence analysis.

### Strengths

In summary, the contributions of this paper are significant on the design method and solid convergence analysis.

### Weaknesses
It is better to list some bilevel optimization examples in machine learning that have non-smooth and weakly convex lower level functions, which will strength the motivation of this work.

### Questions
Some comments:

1)	In the proposed algorithm 1, there exist five tuning parameters $\alpha_k,\beta_k,\eta_k,\gamma,c_k$. Although the authors gave the range of these parameters in the convergence analysis, I still think the choice of these tuning parameters is not easy in practice. 

2)	From the convergence analysis, I saw that the authors used the condition that $f(x,y)$ is a weakly convex. I suggest that the authors should add this condition in Assumption 3.2 of the paper.

3)	The inequality (11) in Assumption 3.2 (ii) is a strict condition ? If not , please give an example.

4)	It is better to list some bilevel optimization examples in machine learning that have nonsmooth and weakly convex lower level functions, which will strength the motivation of this work.

### Summary
The paper applies the Moreau envelope for solving bilevel optimization with non-convex low-level optimization. The proposed algorithm extends such Moreau envelope framework from convex to non-convex settings, achieves a single loop structure, and avoids Hessian computation at the same time. A non-asymptotic convergence rate is derived and extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate faster convergence and superior performance.

### Strengths
1. Compared to previous bilevel optimization algorithms, the proposed MEHA algorithm is both single-loop and hessian-free, yielding an advantage in the efficiency of convergence. 

2. The numerical evaluation conducted is quite comprehensive, covering both synthetic experiments and various real-world tasks.

### Weaknesses
The only weakness the reviewer sees is the lack of technical novelty, as the analysis is largely based on previous work utilizing the Moreau envelope for convex low-level objectives (Gao et al., 2023), and other Hessian-free works. As a result, the proposed method seems like an extension / combination of previous methods.

### Summary
The authors propose a single-loop algorithm for bilevel optimization problems.
The algorithm can handle non-smooth and smooth + non-smooth weakly convex inner functions. The authors provide convergence rates under very weak assumptions (smoothness of the outer and the inner problem).

### Strengths
To my knowledge, this work contains two major novelties:
- in the smooth case, convergence proof a single loop algorithm with weak assumptions (smoothness of the inner and the outer problem only, no need for bounded gradients)
- in the non-smooth case, to my knowledge, this is the first single-loop algorithm proposed
Maybe the authors and other reviewers can comment on this.

### Weaknesses
While the proposed algorithm is clearly defined, authors could do a better job at providing the intuitions: the directions $d_x^k$ and $d_y^k$ are given with little context. The same comment applies to the merit function and Lemma 3.1.

### Questions
- Could you comment on the novelty, is this the first analysis with such a weak set of assumptions? Or I am missing something?

- Could you give intuitions on the proof? (which is currently 10 pages long in the appendix) and intuitions on the merit function.
Maybe the authors could provide a proof sketch
