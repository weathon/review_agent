- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Consumer electronics used to follow the miniaturization trend described by Moore’s Law. Despite the continuous growth in the processing power of Microcontroller Units (MCUs), the MCUs used in the smallest appliances are still not capable of running even moderately big, state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs). Deploying ANNs on this class of devices becomes even more challenging when they are required to operate in a time-sensitive manner, as the model’s inference cannot be distributed over time. In this work, we present a novel method called Scattered Online Inference (SOI) that aims to reduce the computational complexity of ANNs. SOI is developed based on the premise that time-series data is continuous and/or seasonal, and so are the model’s predictions. This applied extrapolation leads to processing speed improvements, especially in the deeper layers of the model. The application of strides forces the ANN to produce more general inner partial states of the model, as they are based on a higher number of input samples that lie further apart from each other. As a result, SOI allows skipping full model recalculation at each inference by performing only the strictly necessary operations. We present two possible patterns of inference achievable with SOI - Partially Predictive (PP) and Fully Predictive (FP). For the audio separation task, we achieved a 64.4% reduction in computational complexity at the cost of 9.8% of SI-SNRi for the PP variant, and a 41.9% reduction at the cost of 7.70% SI-SNRi with the FP variant. Moreover, the latter variant reduces inference time by an additional 28.7%. Similar results are also presented for the acoustic scene classification task with a model based on the GhostNet architecture.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel method called Scattered Online Inference (SOI) that aims to reduce the computational complexity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining their performance. The SOI method is based on the principles of partial predictions of the network's future state, a two-phase system involving data compression using strided convolutions and reconstruction through extrapolation, achieving an RNN-like inference pattern within CNNs by leveraging the capabilities of Short-Term Memory Convolution (STMC) layers, preserving the causal nature of the optimized network architecture, and being applicable to single-frame online inference.

### Strengths
Originality: The proposed SOI method is a creative combination of existing ideas and techniques, such as strided convolutions, STMC layers, and partial predictions, to achieve a unique approach to reducing computational complexity in ANNs.

Quality: The authors have provided a thorough explanation of the SOI method, its underlying principles, and its implementation, as well as experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.

Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the concepts and methods involved, making it easy for readers to understand the proposed approach and its implications.

Significance: The SOI method addresses an important challenge in the field of ANNs, particularly for real-time applications and small appliances where energy consumption and time are crucial factors. By reducing the computational complexity of ANNs, this method has the potential to enable more efficient deployment of neural networks in such scenarios.

### Weaknesses
The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other existing methods for reducing computational complexity in ANNs, highlighting the specific advantages and potential limitations of the SOI method compared to alternative approaches.

While the authors have provided experimental results for the audio separation and acoustic scene classification tasks, it would be beneficial to see the performance of the SOI method in other application domains, to demonstrate its generalizability and potential impact across different types of problems. 

In the experimental results presented in Table 2, the SOI method, when compared to STMC, does not show a significant difference in complexity for the closest SI-SNRi metric: STMC achieves 7.69 with 100% complexity, while Predictive 1 achieves 7.41 with 96.3% complexity. It is worth noting that a slight compromise in performance metrics can lead to a significant reduction in model complexity. Therefore, the claim of computational optimization in the abstract, which states a 64.4% reduction in computational complexity at the cost of 9.8% of SI-SNRi for the PP variant, and a 41.9% reduction at the cost of 7.70% SI-SNRi with the FP variant, may not be entirely convincing, as similar results might be achievable by simply reducing the model size without necessarily relying on the SOI method.
A more fair comparison should be made on the same performance level with different complexities or the same complexity level with different performances. From the experiments, I did not see a significant advantage of the SOI method compared to STMC in this regard.

### Questions
How does the SOI method perform when applied to other types of ANNs, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based models? Can the method be easily adapted to these architectures?

Are there any specific types of problems or application domains where the SOI method is particularly well-suited or might encounter difficulties? If so, could the authors provide some insights into the factors that contribute to these differences in performance?

Can the SOI method be combined with other techniques for model optimization, such as pruning or quantization, to further improve efficiency and performance? If so, are there any potential trade-offs or challenges that need to be considered when combining these methods?

### Weaknesses
**Limited Comparison:** The paper could be strengthened by including a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods would further enhance the paper's quality.

**Generalization:**

- *Focus on CNNs:* The paper primarily discusses the application of SOI to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While this is a significant contribution, the generality of the method could be questioned if it is not easily adaptable or applicable to other neural network architectures. And for CNN, the only baseline lies on STMC which seems not generalizable.

- *Limited to Audio-Related Tasks*: The paper provides examples and results primarily related to audio separation and acoustic scene classification tasks. Demonstrating the effectiveness of SOI across a wider variety of use cases and domains would strengthen its generality and appeal to a broader audience.

### Questions
9.8% reduction in metrics of speech spearation task seems significant to me, could you provide some context to justify this reduction is minor? for example, you can claim in another paper, their performance drop is much more like xx.x% when complexity is 50% so that reader can know 9.8% is minor in a rought impression.

### Summary
The authors proposed a method for reducing the computational cost of a convolutional neural
network by reusing network partial states from previous inferences, leading to a generalization of
these states over longer time periods. The authors claimed that the proposed method achieves a computational cost reduction of 50% without any drop in metrics in the ASC task and a 64.4% reduction in computational cost with only a 9.8% reduction in metrics for the speech separation task. After the comparison, the paper implied that the proposed method offers an alternative to the STMC solution for strided convolution.

### Strengths
The authors introduced two possible patterns of inference achievable
with SOI - Partially Predictive (PP) and Fully Predictive (FP). For the audio separation task,  64.4% reduction was achieved in computational complexity at the cost of 9.8% of SI-SNRi for the PP variant, and a 41.9% reduction at the cost of 7.70% SI-SNRi with the FP variant. Moreover, the latter variant reduces inference time by an additional 28.7%. Similar results are also presented for the acoustic
scene classification task with a model based on the GhostNet architecture. From this sense, I personally believe that the authors' work provides another option for reducing time cost for time-series data processing with reasonable explanation through the details of the experiment results and corresponding theoretical analytics.

### Weaknesses
I would suggest adding at least two more experiments to the experiment part to strengthen and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. Although the current experiment is cool, to better support the authors' theory, it is always good to shoot some or more real application cases with sound results.

### Summary
The authors present a method called scattered online inference that applies strides to convolutional processing of time series data, and performing partial or full prediction for extrapolating values in between. The authors test this method on a number of benchmarks and show that their method can get close to the performance of STMC.

### Strengths
The method seems to provide significant computational savings without too big a big drop in performance.

### Weaknesses
I found it very hard to piece together what the authors have done in this paper: the problem being solved, the specific application domain, the specific format of the input, the differences from STMC etc. The authors seem to depend entirely on the STMC and other papers to provide this context. I had to read a number of previous papers to understand even the context of the paper. The authors need to give more background in the main text.

The empirical comparisons also seem very limited, including only STMC and some variants of their method.

### Questions
There are various presentation issues. Examples:
- Fig. 1: C and E seem identical.
- Sec. 2.2: X seems to have length N and N also seems to be the number of samples.
- in Abstract, second to last sentence: Not clear what latter refers to
- Fig. 2 caption has two B). Seems to be off by one.
