# On the Effect of Defection in Federated Learning and How to Prevent It

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
Federated learning is a machine learning protocol that enables a large population of agents to collaborate. These agents communicate over multiple rounds to produce a single, consensus model. Despite this collaborative framework, there are instances where agents may choose to defect permanently—essentially withdrawing from the collaboration—if they are content with their instantaneous model in that round. This work demonstrates the detrimental impact such defections can have on the final model's robustness and ability to generalize. We also show that current federated optimization algorithms fall short in disincentivizing these harmful defections. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees to prevent defections while ensuring asymptotic convergence to an effective solution for all participating agents. We also provide numerical experiments to corroborate our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

### Summary
The paper studies federated learning problems where the agents can strategically choose the early quit the FL process. The authors present examples when such early quitting can happen and how these cases can affect the losses of all agents. The authors later present an algorithm: Adaptive Defection-aware Aggregation for Gradient Descent (ADA-GD) and claim that this algorithm can disincentivize early quitting under some assumptions on the loss functions, parameter space, and the agents' heterogeneity.

### Strengths
The authors are able to make several observations on why the defective early quitting can happen and identified cases when such quitting may or may not negatively influence the agents that have not quitted. Overall, the problem of preventing early quitting is an interesting branch in strategic FL problems.

### Weaknesses
1. Unrealistic problem setting on the agents' incentives. The authors assume that the agents quit the FL process as long as they are \epsilon close to optimal solution. In ADA-GD, the agents are simply ignored when they are sufficiently close to the \epsilon-optimal set and are kept waiting in the system. This is highly unrealistic, if the faster agents know the server will implement ADA-GD, then the very first time they are ignored, why don't they early quit and run another round of local gradient update? The assumption that the agents are only first-order strategic is not a good enough assumption, there should be more careful design on the backward induction steps, and I think we need a much more sophisticated algorithm than ADA-GD to make sure strategic agents are happy (incentive compatible and individually rational) to participate in the algorithm given they have realistic outside options (like training the final gradient step themselves). 
2. Unrealistic assumptions on the server's information availability. In ADA-GD, the server can observe the agents' losses instead of just their gradients is not realistic.
3. In sufficient discussion on the field of FL, strategic learning and insufficient comparisons with related works, I suggest the authors provide a table that list out the (1) type of strategic manipulations of related works in FL, as well as the (2) assumptions those paper make, and (3) convergence as well as robustness guarantees. Moreover, I'm very suspicious about the claim on page 4 "if there is no shared minima for all agents, applying FL is not reasonable". First of all, this is not known prior to participating in the FL process for all agents. Secondly, I suggest the authors discuss related works in personalized FL and further explain this claim here.
4. Very restrictive settings like "strong convexity, smoothness, realizability, and minimal heterogeneity" makes the algorithm unable to run on deep learning tasks like vision and NLP.
5. Unclear why the server wants to find a solution in W^*, as long as the agents are all \epsilon happy, all participants should be fine with the outcome.

### Questions
Please refer to the weaknesses part and explain why the unrealistic claims are in fact realistic. 

In addition,
1. What is the model used for 2 class Cifar-10 classification? Why does this satisfy all the assumptions in the paper?
2. Which of the examples satisfy Assumption 4?

### Summary
This paper studied the problem of defections in federated learning, where agents may choose to defect permanently, i.e. withdrawing from the collaboration, if they are content with their instantaneous model in a round. The paper first analyzed the potential negative impact of such defection on the final model's robustness and ability to generalize. It distinguished between benign and harmful defections and explore the influence of (i) initial conditions (ii) learning rates (iii) aggregation methods on the occurrence of harmful defections. The paper then proposed a new algorithm which prevents defection and analyzed its properties theoretically and empirically (in comparison to FedAvg).

### Strengths
- Overall this paper is written with a good clarity, and the illustrative examples are helpful for understanding the mechanisms / possible impact of defection
- The paper studies an important and practical game theoretical consideration in federated learning, where the agents are not always incentivized to stay. Through detailed examples with two agents, the paper provided nice examples where the defections can be benign or harmful depending on the different initializations, learning rates or aggregation algorithms. 
- The proposed algorithm offers an intuitive and natural solution, where the server simply tunes the update direction to avoid the defection of any agent which is near the defection threshold. Theoretically under assumptions 1-4, this algorithm is guaranteed to prevent defection.
- Numerical simulations in comparison to FedAvg are provided to support the theoretical result.

### Weaknesses
- Under the current algorithm design, it seems that Assumption 4 (Minimal Heterogeneity) is rather crucial. However, such an assumption which essentially assumes no "similar" agents seem to be hard to achieve in practice, in particular agents tend to join federated learning if they share similar goals and have similar loss functions to minimize. It would be good to see more discussion how deviation from the perfect heterogeneity can impact the proposed algorithm's outcome.
- The simulations presented in the paper were relatively week and were conducted in simple settings with only two agents. The empirical evaluations need to be strengthened with larger number of agents / more realistic datasets.

### Questions
- Will algorithm 1 incentivize the agents that are on the verge of defecting to report non-truthful losses to the server? 
- How does the violation of minimal heterogeneity affect the guarantee of algorithm 1?

### Summary
The paper discusses when agents in a federated system will defect, and proposes a novel aggregation strategy to prevent defection.
Defection occurs when any particular agent achieves an $\epsilon$-optimal answer and quits from the federation system.
This paper demonstrates how the occurrence of defection is related to choices of initialization and learning rates.
Moreover, the authors propose an example to show that defection is inevitable for the strategy of uniform aggregation.
Instead of uniform aggregation, the paper proposes a novel strategy that predicts whether an agent will defect in the next round and projects the aggregated direction to the orthogonal space of its gradient.
It is claimed that no agent will defect under the novel aggregation strategy.

### Strengths
1. The paper considers the quit of agents in federated systems, which is missing in previous works of federated learning. Agents stop contributing their data when their local models achieve the $\epsilon$-optimal set of their local problems. The quitting mechanism naturally matches most real-life situations.
2. The paper discusses the effects of defection in detail with an easy but clear example. Moreover, a counterexample is proposed to show failures of the uniform aggregation in avoiding defection.

### Weaknesses
1. The quitting mechanism introduced in 'Rational Agents' is weird. Specifically, an agent only considers quitting after communication rounds while it does not consider quitting during local updates.
2. The empirical experiment is not enough to justify the proposed method. Firstly, $K=1$ is not enough for the application of federated learning. Most applications of federated learning are carried out with a larger number of local updates, $K>1$.
3. The performance of ADA-GD is not comparable with local SGD using uniform aggregation. Figure 7(a) reveals that local SGD achieves higher accuracy and lower error before the defection happens. In this way, I believe that uniform aggregation with a controller detecting the defection for an early stop will beat ADA-GD.

### Questions
See Weaknesses and there are some typos as follows:
1. Why is the updating direction of $w_2$ in Figure 5(a) not parallel with those of $w_1,w_3,w_4$? 
2. What do you mean with $(2\epsilon,\epsilon)$ in explaining Observation 3?
3. The definition of $\nabla F(w_{t-1})$ is missing in Algorithm 1.

### Summary
This paper studies possible defection in federated learning where clients can choose to opt out, which can negatively affect the final model performance. This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm that aggregates the clients differently to avoid defections and achieve convergence.

### Strengths
- The investigated topic is interesting and relevant for current FL algorithms.
- Theoretical analysis is provided for smooth and convex problems.
- Provide simple experiments to show that the proposed algorithms outperforms the previous algorithms.

### Weaknesses
- A concern I have is that ADA-GD assumes that clients are required to be rational in the way that ADA-GD defines them to be. In other words, the fixed precision parameter $\epsilon$ is the universal learning goal which may not be practical in practice where clients can have heterogeneous goals. The proposed definition of the rational agents is rather ambiguous, and also how to set the precision parameters is tricky. What does it really mean for a potentially defecting worker to be content in practice? 

- Another concern I have is the way the ADA-GD excludes updates from the defecting workers. Wouldn't this lead to a biased model towards non-defecting clients? 

- Also, I wonder that if the workers have the freedom opt in or opt out, wouldn't the server not be able to force the clients to participate? 

- Lastly, is there a reason that the work has not compared with other incentivized FL work such as [1-3] below?

I noticed that the authors have referenced the literature but I do not agree with the authors' note that these work are a bit orthogonal to your work. Why is this the case?
