## Abstract
Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph data. In its most realistic setting, the problem consists of predicting missing or future links between random pairs of nodes from the set of disconnected pairs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the predominant framework for link prediction. GNN-based methods treat link prediction as a binary classification problem and handle the extreme class imbalance---real graphs are very sparse---by sampling (uniformly at random) a balanced number of disconnected pairs not only for training but also for evaluation. However, we show that the reported performance of GNNs for link prediction in the balanced setting does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and that simpler topology-based approaches are often better at handling sparsity. These findings motivate Gelato, a similarity-based link-prediction method that applies (1) graph learning based on node attributes to enhance a topological heuristic, (2) a ranking loss for addressing class imbalance, and (3) a negative sampling scheme that efficiently selects hard training pairs via graph partitioning. Experiments show that Gelato is more accurate and faster than GNN-based alternatives.

### Summary
The authors introduce Gelato - “Graph enhancement for link prediction with autocovariance” -, a new similarity-based link prediction algorithm enhancing an existing topological heuristic (Autocovariance) with graph learning, specially designed to handle very sparse graphs. 

This approach, that leverages the node attribute information, predicts edges between node pairs with high Autocovariance similarity. The parameters of the MLP model used to incorporate node attribute information into the weight of the edge are optimized through a ranking-based N-pair loss for which hard training negative node pairs are sampled.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and quite enjoyable to read. The authors are well explaining how certain state-of-the-art methods such as graph neural networks (GNN) are actually tested in a biased manner (not including all negative pairs, in potentially non-sparse graphs) where in practice graphs are usually sparse and not all positive pairs are known. 

They also highlights performance limitations of GNN: a binary classification loss sensitive to class imbalance and the inability to learn strong topology of the data to better introduce Gelato.

Steps of the algorithm are clearly stated:

-The node attribution information is used to extend the set of initial edges with new ones between nodes for which similarity is higher than a specified threshold.

-The new augmented graph is associated with a trainable weight which is learned via a MLP network. The final edge weights are a weighted combination of the topological, MLP-learned weights and similarity score between the node features. By design, the final graph contains both structural and attribute information. 

-To this enhanced graph, we associate negative pairs which are generated within node partitions obtained via the METIS algorithm (I wish there was more explanation though, not to describe METIS algorithm itself but how sampling is performed from the multiple hiearchical partitions). The objective of this process is to have hard negative pairs for the training. 

-Then the trainable weights of the MLP model - assumed to learn meaningful interactions between any two node attributes linked by an edge in the enhanced graph- are optimized so that to rank the positive edges between 2 nodes higher than the negative ones (instead of classifying them between positive and negative ones which is complex for very unbalanced classes). 

Focusing on accuracy AND scalability, it is indeed discussed how to efficiently compute the n-square Autocovariance similarity matrix (used to define the weighted adjacency matrix of the enhanced graph).

Code of the approach is made publicly available, which is highly appreciated for reproducibility of the results and wide adoption of the approach by the ML community. 

Experiments are made on 4 public real-world datasets and Gelato is compared against 4 SOTA GNN-based approaches as well as 3 heuristics. 
They show that Gelato is outperforming GNN-based approaches in the unbiased setting regarding link prediction performance (2nd best approach is the heuristic that Gelato is empowering with graph learning). 

However, in the bias and partitioned settings, NCN seems to be better at distinguishing positive pairs from the negative ones.

### Weaknesses
In METIS, the original graph is transformed into sequentially smaller graphs $G_1$,$G_2$, …, $G_p$ such that $|V_0| > |V_1| > |V_2| >...> |V_p|$. What is unclear to me is how exactly the negative edges are sampled from the hierarchical partitions. Maybe some pictures to describe the process might be helpful. 

As highlighted by the authors, in the partitioned setting, NCN seems to be better at distinguishing positive pairs from the negative ones compared to Gelato. 

Potential limitation of the paper is that the contribution is mostly experimental (from sometimes existing blocks) and as a consequence we might expect more experiments to support the proposed approach (GNN instead of MLP in Gelato is left for future work for instance, same as for other types of ranking-based losses that could have been compared).

### Questions
Q1: Can you explain a little more in detail how you generate negative edges from the partitions? Do you have p ways of generating negative edges? In comparison is unbiased sampling corresponding to sampling ALL possible negative edges?

Q2: Is Gelato also outperforming other SOTA algorithms for non-sparse graphs, in the described biased setting?

Q3: Did you investigate the learning of the \alpha and \beta hyperparameters?

=== AFTER REBUTTAL ===

Many thanks to the authors for taking the time to answer my questions. Thank you very much for the extra experiments that help to get a sense of how Gelato is behaving. However, I wish to keep my overall score.

### Summary
This paper studies link prediction on attributed graphs. It argues that a balanced number of disconnected pairs does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and proposes some techniques to develop Gelato, with a graph learning based on node attributes, a ranking loss for handling class imbalance, and a negative sampling technique to handle hard training pairs.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is easy to follow with reasonable clarity to understand the techniques.
2.	Experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets.

### Weaknesses
1.	The techniques in the proposed method in Section 3.1 to 3.4 are mostly existing techniques simply adopted into the paper. The novelty of the proposed method is quite unclear. Many attributed graph representation learning methods exist. 
2.	The unbiased setting is not well-motivated. Why consider all random node pairs in a graph? For disconnected pairs, given a node, you can just sample the node pairs near the node via graph topology, e.g., within 2-hop, 3-hop. I do not agree that random sampling of all node pairs is more realistic.
3.	Though the experiments are conducted on real datasets, the results cannot reveal too much about the benefits brought by the proposed method. Also as mentioned above, the techniques of attributed graph learning in Section 3.1, 3.2, and N-pair loss in 3.3, negative sampling in 3.4 are with unclear novelty as they are mostly existing techniques.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for link prediction in sparse graph to solve the so-called problem of "biased testing" that select a small portion of negative pair in evaluation of the model

### Strengths
N/A

### Weaknesses
The chief problem the paper raised was the small portion of negative pair used in testing. The arguments do not back up the claim.
- These balanced sampling methods overestimate the ratio of positive pairs. There is no evidence that any of these methods estimating ratios of positive pairs. 
- "AUC is not an effective evaluation metric for link prediction as it is biased towards the majority class". This needs an evidence!
- The example show that negative pairs have <2% of intra-block pairs. What is the problem with this? In fact, one can split any negative sample set into any two imbalanced subsets, then the smaller subset will likely have a smaller number in the sampled training data. Is that smaller subset a "hard" set and, just by splitting, should this dataset have "biased testing" as well?

The paper can call this problem any name, but not "biased testing" as "bias" is a establish statistical term.

### Summary
This paper rethinks the disadvantages of most current link prediction techniques for sparse graphs. Specifically, for sparse graphs, since most negative pair samples are quite different from the positive ones, metrics that sample only a few negative pairs lead to biased testing. To address this problem, this paper suggests that unbiased testing exploiting all negative samples is more persuasive, especially for sparse graphs, and even finds that unsupervised topological heuristics (Autocovariance) can outperform most advanced link prediction techniques. Under this perspective, this paper devises a novel link prediction approach, called Gelato, that is suitable for sparse graphs. Gelato contains four parts: 1) graph learning: incorporate attribute similarity, topological weights, the untrained weights, and the trained weights into the new adjacency matrix; 2) topological heuristic: borrow the heuristic from AC and use equation 6 to alleviate the memory overhead; 3) N-pair loss: relieve the sensitivity to class imbalance; 4) negative sampling: use graph partitioning to generate hard negative samples.

### Strengths
+ Considering that various negative pair samples are actually far from the real links, the motivation that targets unbiased testing is reasonable and the idea makes sense.
+ The writing is clear to show all the details of the proposed Gelato.
+ For the metric hit@1000, Gelato outperforms other baselines on most benchmarks, especially the sparse graphs, which empirically proves the validity of Gelato on sparse graphs.

### Weaknesses
- The design that includes attribute similarity, topological weights, the untrained weights, and the trained weights incorporates three hyper-parameters $\epsilon_{\eta}$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ to control the weights, which makes it more difficult to tune an optimal model.
- Though different parts are delicately devised to improve the performance of Gelato, the ablation study is missing to show the actual effect. For example, does N-pair loss really work, and is better than CE? When ignoring the attribute similarity, will the performance of Gelato still outperform the one of AC? This is quite important because Gelato works worse than AC on dataset OGBL-DDI, which is the only dataset containing no natural node features.
- If possible, the performance of Gelato with different hyperparameters is better to display, which can also show the effect of different modules in Gelato.
- For non-sparse graphs, Gelato seems not to be superior.

### Questions
- How can the model be trained in an end-to-end manner considering that the negative samples need to be partitioned?
- The average degree of OGBL-DDI seems to be wrong.
- Can the authors explain the influence and application of link prediction considering that only a few samples are hit in all the 1,000 samples? Is there any industrial effect when improving the hits@1000 from 10 to 20?
- Since the performance of Gelato is not significant on OGBL-DDI and this dataset is the densest one, can I put forward the conclusion that Gelato is only suitable and useful for sparse graphs?
- What is the time overhead of graph partitioning? Will it occupy much time in the whole model?
