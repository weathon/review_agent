## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights – one per synapse – whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its non spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more. Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters. Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing. Our code is based on PyTorch / SpikingJelly and available at: https://github.com/Thvnvtos/SNN-delays

### Summary
As far as we know, the plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. However, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. In this manuscript, the authors propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation (i.e., offline manner). Then, the kernels contain only a few non-zero weights – one per synapse – whose positions correspond to the delays. Thus, these positions are learned together with the weights using the dilated convolution with learnable spacings (DCLS). The authors show us in a practical way that building deep SNNs can learn together with fixed delays and weights.

### Strengths
1. The gap between theory and practice is opened up, especially an efficient fixed delays with weights learning algorithm is designed.
2. The effects of delays can be well explained by visual examples.
3. The anonymous open source code is shared with readers, and the detailed implementation helps inspire readers to build complex and deep SNNs.

### Weaknesses
1. The reviewers are very concerned about the innovation of the structure, despite the effort that went into achieving such a particularly efficient discrete-time learning algorithm. The reviewer noted these sentences: "The trick is to simulate delays using temporal
convolutions and to learn them using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (Khalfaoui-Hassani et al., 2023a;b). In practice, the method is fully integrated with PyTorch and leverages its automatic-differentiation engine." So can we say that structurally this contribution is just a combination that happens to work. This contribution would be improved if the author could further clarify the motivation or give a more solid analysis. After all, a trick feels like an inadequate contribution.
2. Just two datasets with similar statistic information may not seem sufficient, and it would be better if the authors had time to supplement the experiment with a new dataset.

### Summary
This paper proposes to study an important problem in spiking neural networks, which involves the explicit incorporation of propagation delays between different neurons in the network. This is an important problem that has been addressed regularly in recent years, and the paper provides a novel and simple solution based on a temporal convolution parameterized by a certain precision. The delays are learned using a variant of the surrogate gradient method, and numerical simulations demonstrate the learning of delays by this method. Experimental results show very good performance on traditional community datasets (in particular, a top score in the leaderboard for the Spiking Heidelberg dataset) and also demonstrate a certain robustness of the method when certain connections are pruned.

### Strengths
The paper effectively introduces the problem and motivation and presents the methods clearly. A major strength of the paper is the model's relative mathematical simplicity and its successful performance in supervised classification on two datasets. Promising experimental results indicate that significant energy savings can be achieved with the application of such models to neuromorphic chips by demonstrating the network's robustness when connections are removed.

### Weaknesses
The paper's connections with related works are satisfactory; however, it could benefit from presenting neuroscientific evidence on the plasticity of neural delays in biology. Additionally, it lacks a discussion on the relationship between the model's parameters and those observed in biology. For instance, the maximum delays utilized are around 250 milliseconds (300 milliseconds for SSC), while delays used in Izhikevitch's polychronization model are around 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the paper does not establish any predictions made by the model that can be experimentally observed in biology.

The model has several limitations, such as the use of discrete time, a forward propagation training model, or a limited number of computational layers. However, the presented performance of the network validates the decisions made.

### Questions
What is the influence of the meta-parameters on the obtained performance? The influence of the characteristic time of the membrane potential would be interesting to study, as it corresponds to a kind of regularization of spike precision.

Could you comment on the fact that "We found that a LIF with quasi-instantaneous leak τ = 10.05 (since ∆t = 10) is better than using a Heaviside function for SHD." ? Would such a difference matter in biology?

Concerning "We used a one-cycle learning rate scheduler (Smith & Topin, 2018) for the weights and cosine annealing (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) without restarts for the delays learning rates. ": Could you comment on your choice of learning rate schedulers? Would different schedulers significantly alter our results? Or does it just improve learning speed?

Minor:
- complete reference for Kingma, for Warden. There seems to be a newer one by Grimaldi for "Learning heterogeneous delays" instead of "Learning hetero-synaptic delays" - plus an additional application paper on motion detection by the same authors. 
- spacing: "weights.Hammouamri et al. (2022)"
The LaTeX formatting of the paper is excellent but could be further enhanced. In Figure 1, utilize "N_2", "S_1", and other symbols for clarity. Some citations in the text ("Spike-Element-Wise ResNet Fang et al. (2021b) ", ...) should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g. using `citep`. Text "reset" appearing in equation (1) should be formatted as text, e.g.  using the `\text{}` formatting.

### Summary
The paper presents a way to learn synaptic (or axonal) delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs), where the delay of each synapse is realized as a discretized kernel of temporal convolution with a single non-zero element. An evaluation of classification accuracy on three temporal datasets shows that the method works well, with the authors claiming to surpass the state of the art in those datasets.

### Strengths
When evaluated within the context of SNNs alone, the paper offers several strengths. Namely, the method is relatively original, the evidence that the method works well is rather convincing, and the impact on SNNs could be significant, given the relative ease of implementation and effectiveness. SNNs themselves interest a growing community.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is common to many works on SNNs. Specifically, the significance, novelty, potential impact, and experimental validation are limited to the narrow field of SNNs themselves. Very rarely does an SNN paper show its advantages in the broader literature on neural networks, let alone in the real world. The present manuscript too, when evaluated in a broader scope, suffers from the same issues.

More concretely:
- the method is only new for SNNs, but not for neural networks in general.
- the performance is claimed to surpass the state of the art (already in the abstract), but the authors do not actually compare with the true state of the art, including non-spiking networks.
- there is no experimental comparison with standard (i.e. less constrained) temporal convolutions.

Therefore, it is unclear what the true contribution of the work is, beyond a nice conceptual analogy between temporal convolutions and synaptic delays.


Secondary weaknesses:
- Even within spiking networks, the work does not seem to surpass the state of the art, contrary to the authors' claims. In [1], a partly spiking neural network reached 95.6% on the GSC v0.02, where the authors report 95.35% at most. The manuscript does not cite that prior work.
- The paper does not motivate sufficiently the choice of spiking neurons as a model. A paragraph explaining the advantages of SNNs *in comparison with the true state of the art, i.e. ANNs*, supported with citations that demonstrate them measurably, such as energy efficiency, but also rarely in other metrics such as speed of inference and training [1] and even classification accuracy [2]. Any other arguments and citations that the authors can add to support that choice would be useful.
- The authors claim that there is no recurrency in their models, but a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron's leak membrane potential is equivalent to a self-recurrent connection. I understand what the authors mean, but, again in the spirit of appealing to the broader ICLR community and not only to the SNN niche, this should be clarified.

----------------------------------
EDIT (adding my responses here too, for public visibility):

----------------------------------
The authors' response dedicates a large section to address points that I did not make. To correct the record I must unfortunately reply to that section too, even though it is merely a distraction.

Nowhere did I claim that SNNs are not important or not a legitimate research direction, or that the entire field deserves rejection. I did not dismiss the paper on the basis of it being an SNN. I did point out that some of its weaknesses are frequent in the SNN literature, but pointing that out does not make those weaknesses irrelevant to this specific review. The attempt by the authors to entirely dismiss my review based on how many SNN papers per year are published and how many good reviews the paper received is an attempt to evade my specific criticisms. Worse, the aggressive style of the authors' response, and the misconstrual of my arguments as if they were a personal matter of mine is not helpful.

Again, SNNs can certainly have important advantages, and some SNNs do have them, but a neural network merely being implemented with spiking neurons does not guarantee these benefits. An SNN paper must be evaluated as any other paper, and not merely be accepted as a significant contribution because the network is spiking.

Despite this attempt to discount my comments, I continue my contribution to this process in a separate comment.

----------------------------------

Some important weaknesses remain.

- The key method that the authors used is not new, only its application is.

- The so-far evaluation does not suffice to compare with other works:
(a) Two of the three used datasets have received very little if any attention outside of the SNN literature.
(b) Only feedforward architectures, with only 2 or 3 layers, have been tested.
(c) Only spiking networks have been tested, so it is unclear whether the same results could be achieved, for example, with much smaller (and thus possibly more efficient) non-spiking networks.

- The paper is missing a sufficient motivation of SNNs as a model. A paragraph with the potential benefits of SNNs should be added, citing the previously demonstrated improvements in efficiency, inference speed, and even classification accuracy, but it should also explain that these benefits are not present in all SNNs by default. Examples of such references were given in my original review.


**On the other hand**, the paper now does include a comparison with a more standard method, i.e. conventional temporal convolutions, and it does outperform it. Of course, the work already was a good contribution to the SNN field, but this addition makes it now a relatively convincing demonstration of the power of learned delays more generally, that is a also useful result for the broader ICLR community. Based on these, I am raising my score.

### Questions
Could the weaknesses be addressed? Most importantly, could the paper better clarify its significance in the broader field of neural networks? Changes and additions to the text might help address the issues somewhat, but missing experimental evaluations should ideally also be performed, or other measurements of any possible advantage claimed, e.g. number of parameters, energy efficiency etc.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors use the previously published Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS) method to learn delays in a deep feed-forward spiking neural network using back-propagation. They demonstrate this method on various temporal tasks such as spiking Heidelberg dataset and versions of google speech commands. The authors also demonstrate that learning delays contributes to an increase in performance in sparse networks.

### Strengths
- Learning delays, and more generally, using temporal information is a very relevant topic.
- The paper is generally well written and the experiments and setup are clearly described.
- The improvement of performance in networks with fixed sparsity when delays are included is very interesting and this analysis is novel.

### Weaknesses
- The novel contribution of this paper over the DCLS paper is not clear. Is it just the evaluation on multiple tasks? It is very important to clarify this aspect.
- The comparison of the model with delays versus no-delays in Sec. 4.3 may not be completely fair: Using more layers (with same number of parameters) for the no-delay network seems more comparable.
- The statement of "Here we show for the first time that delays can be learned together with the weights, using backpropagation, in arbitrarily deep SNNs." is not true. (Shrestha & Orchard 2018) do exactly that.
- Some of the related work are incorrectly cited or not cited:
    - The SLAYER paper (Shrestha & Orchard 2018) does train the delays along with the weights but the authors don't mention it in this context (although it is cited in a different context).
    - dynamically adapting firing thresholds for deep (recurrent) SNNs was first proposed in (Bellec et al. 2018)
    - Spike based transformer references should include SpikeGPT (Rui-Jie et al. 2023) and Spikingformer (Zhou, Chenlin, et al. 2023)

### Questions
## Suggestions:

- The DVS gesture recognition dataset, due to its event-based nature, might have been a really good fit for a method that learns delays.
- Since delays use temporal information, it might have made more sense to use a loss function that made use of this (for e.g. time-to-first-spike loss)
