# Fair Adversarial Training: on the Adversarial Attack and Defense of Fairness

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
While numerous work has been proposed to address fairness in machine learning, existing methods do not guarantee fair predictions under imperceptible adversarial feature perturbation, and a seemingly fair model can suffer from large group-wise disparities under such perturbation. Moreover, while adversarial training has been shown to be reliable in improving a model's robustness to defend against adversarial feature perturbation that deteriorates accuracy, it has not been properly studied in the context of adversarial perturbation against fairness. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we study the problem of adversarial attack and adversarial robustness w.r.t. two terms: fairness and accuracy. From the adversarial attack perspective, we propose a unified structure for adversarial attacks against fairness which brings together common notions in group fairness, and we theoretically prove the equivalence of adversarial attacks against different fairness notions. Further, we derive the connections between adversarial attacks against fairness and those against accuracy. From the adversarial robustness perspective, we theoretically align robustness to adversarial attacks against fairness and accuracy, where robustness w.r.t. one term enhances robustness w.r.t. the other term. Our study suggests a novel way to unify adversarial training w.r.t. fairness and accuracy, and experiments show our proposed method achieves better robustness w.r.t. both terms.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of how adversarial training performs in the context of adversarial perturbation against fairness by studying the problem of adversarial attack and adversarial robustness for fairness and accuracy. From the adversarial attack perspective, this paper proposes a unified structure for adversarial attacks against fairness, which brings together common notions of group fairness. This paper proves the equivalence of adversarial attacks against different fairness notions and derives the connection between adversarial attacks against fairness and accuracy. From the adversarial robustness perspective, this paper theoretically aligns robustness to adversarial attacks against fairness and accuracy.

### Strengths
1.The author addresses the problem of applying adversarial training in the context of fairness depreciation under adversarial perturbation, which is important but underexplored.

2.The paper provides a clear definition and explanation of the difference between accuracy robustness and fairness robustness.

3.This paper demonstrates that based on spatial proximity, samples can attain alignment between the fairness attack and the accuracy attack. This paper also provides a theoretic discussion about how fairness robustness and accuracy robustness can benefit from each other.

### Weaknesses
1. The explanation of Figure 1 is unclear. The paper claims that the Balck TPR and White TNR, with 100% accuracy, will cause destructive and social injustice against the disadvantaged group. However, it may be correct. Only discussing Black TPR and White TNR is not sufficient and not convincing. The problem for causing injustice is the model has a high Black TPR while having a low Black TNR. (or Low White TPR and High White TNR).

2. The presentation could be clearer (sentence after Equation 5, “adversarial sample ny xi”, what does ny represent?)

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified framework for fairness attacks and defense.

### Strengths
This paper formally defines fairness attacks and fairness defense. The mathematical formulation is very clean.

Experiments show that fair attack can successfully attack natural training models, reaching maximum EOD and DI. While fair adversarial training successfully reduces them to 0.

### Weaknesses
Firstly, I recommend reformatting Corollary 1 and 2 to be Proposition 1 and 2.

The designations of Theorem 1 and 2 seem more suited to intermediate results rather than formal theorems. Specifically, regarding Theorem 1:

1) The paper doesn't explain how the fairness robustness between $x_{FN,1}$ and $x_{FN,0}$ can be employed to ascertain the fairness robustness guaranteed by accuracy robustness.

2) The upper bound presented appears convoluted. The significance and roles of each term, notably $G_t$ and $\eta_t$, are not adequately explained. Furthermore, the insights or conclusions that readers should glean from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 ought to be more comprehensively discussed.

Similar issue appear to Theorem 2.

3) The discussion of the experiments is sparse.

4) Most importantly, the purpose of a fairness attack remains unclear to me. What specific objective does a fairness attacker want to attack the fairness of an ML model? Consequently, I question the emphasis on increasing model fairness against such attackers. Addressing fairness issues stemming from data or algorithmic biases appears to be more important.

Based on the last question, I will first give a confidence score 2. I am flexible about adjusting my score.

### Summary
- The authors present a unified structure for adversarial training that can be applied to various notions of group fairness.

- The authors demonstrate some theoretical results that establish a relationship between robustness for fairness and robustness for accuracy.

- The authors have proposed an adversarial training scheme that considers both fairness robustness and accuracy robustness, and they have verified its performance through several experiments.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel concern: robustness concerning fairness measures.

- The proposed algorithm and theoretical findings have been validated through experiments.

### Weaknesses
- The concept of an adversarial attack concerning a group fairness measure seem unconventional. While existing adversarial attacks utilize point-wise objectives, the proposed fairness attack employs a group-wise objective such as DI or EOd. When this proposed attack is applied at a single point, it can influence all subsequent attacks from other points. This leads to a notational issue in defining fairness adversarial samples: $L_{DI}$ and $L(x, a, y)$ are used interchangeably. It might be more suitable to carry out the attack using individual fairness measures.

- The presentation of fairness robustness lacks clarity in its definition. Only expressions - related to fairness robustness, indicate improved fairness robustness - are presented. The absence of a clear definition weakens the authors' assertions.

- The main assertion here is that the robustness secured by accuracy adversarial samples can guarantee fairness robustness, and vice versa. However, there appears to be a significant issue. When a fairness attack is executed with an objective like DI, its evaluation relies on cross-entropy. Then, in terms of accuracy robustness, fairness attacks essentially amount to weaker attacks on cross-entropy compared to PGD attacks with a cross-entropy objective. In light of this, the proposed claims about alignment of robustnesses become somewhat trivial, potentially diminishing the authors' contributions.

- Being robust to PGD attacks does not necessarily imply the overall adversarial robustness of the model. For a more reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness, I would encourage you to consider using AutoAttack (AA) [1]. AA comprises three white-box attacks (APGD and APGD-DLR as described in [1], and FAB in [2]), along with one black-box attack (Square Attack [3]). In the recent field of adversarial robustness research, it has become a standard practice to report robust accuracies against AA as a means of assessing gradient obfuscation [4].

- (Notational Problems) The authors are simultaneously using $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ and $D(x_{sub,a})$. To express this more appropriately, I suggest that $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ should be utilized as notation for group characteristics, for example: $D_{sub,a}^{DI}=\min_{sub,a}D(x)$. Furthermore, the notation $x_{sub,a}$ can be confusing, as it refers to a subgroup at times and to an individual point at other times. The lack of a formal definition for fairness robustness is connected to these issues.

### Questions
- Is the term "accuracy" mentioned in the experiments referring to standard accuracy or robust accuracy? If it pertains to robust accuracy, it would be more informative to also include standard accuracy in the presentation of experimental results.

- In Table 2 in Section B of the appendix, how is the value of $D(x_{FN,male})$ calculated? Is it based on a single sample from the subgroup, or is it a group-wise value?

- Regarding the proposed algorithm, the fairness regularization is denoted by gamma. Were the experiments conducted with a fixed gamma value? I couldn't find the specific gamma value in the experimental setups. How do the results vary when gamma is changed, and does the proposed algorithm outperform other methods under different gamma settings?
