## Abstract
Adaptive gradient methods based on exponential moving averages, such as Adam and RMSprop, are widely used for deep learning. However, it is known that they do not converge unless choosing hyperparameters in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix their convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the stochastic gradient is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any hyperparameter choice without the bounded stochastic gradient assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum calculation and the scaling operation by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves competitive or even better results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning.

### Summary
The authors provide a new algorithm as a variant of Adam. Different from Adam that needs to carefully choose the hyperparameters to ensure convergence, ADOPT can converge at the optimal rate with any hyperparameters.  Moreover, the authors relax the condition that gradients are uniformly bounded into the condition that the second-order moment of gradients is bounded. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm is compatible with the other algorithms.

### Strengths
1. The proposed algorithm can converge with arbitrary hyperparameters without divergence issues.

2. The proposed algorithm performs compatible with popular algorithms.

### Weaknesses
1.  For relaxing the condition of gradient assumption, it is misleading to claim that  "the convergence is established without the bounded stochastic gradient assumption". In fact, in the paper, the authors replace the uniformly bounded gradients with bounded second-order moments, which still bounds the gradients of the expected function. Further, [1] shows the convergence of Adam without the assumption of gradients uniformly bounded or second-order moments bounded.

2. In practice, people will use random shuffle instead of random sampling. However, the convergence results only hold for random sampling. In fact, there is a counter-example for the proposed algorithm that can not converge when we use a random shuffle. Let $\beta1 = \beta2 = 0$, and $f_1(x) = 1.9x$ and $f_2(x) = f_3(x) = -x$. With the constraint that $x \in [-1,1]$ the optimal solution should be 1 instead of -1. Thus, although the algorithm can converge in the random sampling setting, it does not deal the case in the practical case.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new Adam-variant algorithm that aims to fix the non-convergence issues of Adam. Specifically, it uses the second moment estimation at previous iteration to perform the preconditioning. The preconditioning is done on the gradient instead of on the momentum as in the case of Adam. The preconditioned gradient is used in the update of momentum, and the momentum (not preconditioned momentum) is used in the update of parameters. The authors show that the modified algorithm (namely ADOPT) can converge for all hyperparameters.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written and can be easily understood. It clearly explains the technical challenges arise in analyzing Adam, and how to resolve them. The resulting algorithm seems to be simple and intuitive following the analysis.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical contribution is not very significant. Even though the bounded gradient assumption is relaxed, the paper requires a bound on the gradient norm squared. For example, the bounded gradient assumption is also not required in the recent work by Yushun Zhang et al.[1]. Besides this, the proof technique seems to be quite similar to that of Zhou et al. [2]. 

- The experimental gain seems to be marginal. For the results in Table 1 and Table 2, it is better to add standard deviations to clearly contrast the results of different algorithms.

### Summary
The paper proposes ADOPT. Compared with Adam, ADOPT uses a decoupled second-order moment estimator and applies exponential averaging after calculating the adaptive update directions. A wide range of experiments show great potential for the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
The proposed ADOPT is a novel algorithm that deserves the attention of deep learning researchers.  The experiments contain a wide range of machine-learning tasks and show promising results.

### Weaknesses
The major issue is in the theoretical analysis. I feel that both (5) and (14) are vacuous. From assumption 4, we know $||\nabla f||^2\le G^2$. However, (14) basically says
$$
\min_{t=1,\cdots,T}||\nabla f(\theta_t)||^2\le O\left(G^2\frac{\alpha L}{\epsilon}\right)
$$
In practice, the learning rate $\alpha$ is not too small, $\epsilon$ has the order of 1e-8, the Lipschitz constant $L$ is very large, so $\frac{\alpha L}{\epsilon}$ is often far greater than $1$. So, the upper bound in (14) is even larger than $G^2$, which is correct by assumption. Therefore, the theoretical analysis is not meaningful.

The authors may try to look at the theoretical analysis in Shi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022 to derive more meaningful bounds.

### Questions
As ADOPT contains two changes compared to Adam, the authors should consider adding some ablation studies in section 5 to see which change has the most significant impact on the performance. Such studies are very informative for the future improvement of adaptive stepsize algorithms. 

Also, in Figure 1 and 3, ADOPT has larger variances. Does this mean ADOPT is less robust than Adam?

Did authors consider adding the bias correction step in the algorithm?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new adaptive gradient method called ADOPT, which addresses the non-convergence issue of popular methods like Adam and RMSprop.  The method modifies the calculation of second moment estimates and the order of momentum calculation and scaling operations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that ADOPT achieves competitive or superior results compared to existing methods across various tasks.

### Strengths
The paper introduces a new adaptive gradient method ADOPT that is as easy as the implementation of Adam, and enjoys easy convergence proofs.

The paper gives in-depth analysis for the convergence of ADOPT with toy examples, in comparison with the failure cases of Adam.

The paper conducts comprehensive numerical experiments on various tasks, demonstrating the competitive performance of ADOPT 
 compared to the widely used Adam.

### Weaknesses
First, the convergence of Adam has been established without any modification, e.g., Defossez et al. 2022 “A simple convergence proof of Adam and AdaGrad”, Wang et al. 2022 "Provable Adaptivity in Adam" and Zhang et al. 2022 "Adam Can Converge Without Any Modification On Update Rules". The convergence of a modified version of Adam is not significant from theoretical sense unless the ADOPT can beat the performance of Adam in practice. 

From the empirical results, the performance of ADOPT is not superior over Adam very much. People may be reluctant to use ADOPT in practice. As for the title "convergence with any hyperparameters", the paper does not verify the performance of ADOPT is not sensitive to hyper-parameters in practice.
