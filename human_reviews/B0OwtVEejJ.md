## Abstract
Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in neural architecture search (NAS), enabling gradient-based methods to explore cell-based architecture spaces significantly faster than traditional blackbox approaches. In parallel, weight entanglement has emerged as a technique for intricate parameter sharing among architectures within macro-level search spaces. Since weight-entanglement poses compatibility challenges for gradient-based NAS methods, these  two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods (enhanced performance, improved supernet training properties and superior any-time performance), while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces. The code for our work is openly accessible [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TangleNAS-527C).

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposes the application of single-stage NAS methods to the weight-entanglement search space. The authors observe that weight-entanglement spaces are typically explored using two-stage methods, while cell-based spaces are usually explored using single-stage methods. The authors bridge the gap between them and conduct extensive experiments.

### Strengths
- The paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method through experiments on different datasets and search spaces.
- The experimental results reveal interesting phenomena and observations.

### Weaknesses
- The motivation behind this work is not clear, and it appears to be a simple combination of existing methods, lacking innovation. What is the necessity and advantage of using single-stage search?
- The weight entanglement has a higher weight-sharing extent. Does the intensification of weight entanglement during the single-stage search process affect search performance?
- The description of the method is too simplistic, resulting in a lack of overall contribution.
- In the experimental section, the comparison with related works is not comprehensive enough, as it does not include some comparisons with methods based on weight entanglement and single-stage NAS.

### Questions
- What is the specific method referred to in Figure 2b? The description is unclear.
- What do LHS and RHS represent in Figure 2?

### Summary
The paper presents a gradient-based neural architecture search approach (TangleNAS) with a weight-entangled search space.  The main idea is to combine the memory efficiency of weight sharing (entanglement) with the search time efficiency of a differentiable (gradient-based) search space.  DrNAS, a gradient-based approach, is taken as a reference and extended to weight sharing by modifying the edge operations. All edge operations are summed after being individually weighted. The approach is evaluated on several standard benchmarks, where it often shows an improvement when combining both types of search spaces.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well written. In particular, the related work is complete and the proposed approach is clearly positioned in relation to existing approaches. In addition, the method is mostly well presented and the main idea is easy to follow. 

+ The proposed idea of edge operations works well in practice. Moreover, the idea could be applied to various gradient-based NAS methods. 

+ The experimental section considers several standard benchmarks for evaluation, both cell-based and macro search spaces. It shows an improvement in results compared to DrNAS for most cases.

### Weaknesses
- Contribution: As stated in the paper, the proposed approach is applicable to different gradient-based NAS methods. It would add value to the paper to demonstrate this. At the moment it looks like an approach to extend DrNAS, but at least DARTS and/or GDAS (or more recent TE-NAS) should have been considered.

-  On the macro search space, it would make sense to consider a macro approach and then introduce the cell-based part of the proposed method. It's not clear what the reference is for measuring the improvement. Nevertheless, the comparison with existing methods is useful. 

- (Major limitation) This is a benchmark driven approach. It would therefore be useful to include the latest results on NAS, e.g. from Lukasik, Jovita, Steffen Jung and Margret Keuper. "Learning where to look - generative NAS is surprisingly efficient." European Computer Vision Conference. Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland, 2022. Then it would also be helpful to discuss why and when the paper lacks performance compared to the latest state-of-the-art approaches. For example, on the DARTS search space (Table 4), the current SOTA is much lower than the paper's results (the cited paper or TE-NAS, for example, perform better). It is therefore important to compare with the latest approaches and possibly improve on their setup.

- Clarity: The method re-defines the parts of the search space. For example, the superset search space and edge definition are missing. In general, the method would benefit from a section defining this problem.

### Questions
- It would be useful to know why the latest SOTA approaches have not been used as a reference for improvement using the proposed approach.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduced architectural parameters to supernet search space, where all operation choices are superposed ontothe largest one with weights. This simple process enables searching for optimal sub-network via gradient-based optimization. The authors applied the proposed method to MobileNetV3 and ViT search space and got promising performance.

### Strengths
The proposed method is simple yet effective. It inherits the good merits of DARTS-like methods (end-to-end learning with the help of architectural parameters) and supernet methods (memory efficient and supporting fine-grained search spaces).

### Weaknesses
Some experimental details are not clear:

- It is unclear from the paper what are the FLOPs and parameter sizes of the searched results in the experiments. Are the comparison are done between networks?

- Any reason why the performance of AutoFormer variants from that paper is not listed in Table 6? Again, there should be the FLOPs and parameter size of each model.

- On Table 7, there should be comparisons with some other works which use MobileNetV3 search space (e.g., AtomNAS), together with their FLOPs and parameter sizes. Why are the results of OFA with progressive shrink not used in the table?

### Questions
My main concern is the lack of some information and comparisons in the experiments, as mentioned above.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the integration of weight entanglement and gradient-based methods in neural architecture search (NAS). The authors propose a scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces, enabling an in-depth comparative assessment of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. The findings reveal that this integration brings forth the benefits of gradient-based methods while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces. Additionally, the paper discusses the insights derived from the single-stage approach in designing architectures for real-world tasks.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces in neural architecture search (NAS). This integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS is a new approach that has not been explored before. The paper also presents a comprehensive evaluation of the properties of single and two-stage approaches, including any-time performance, memory consumption, robustness to training fraction, and the effect of fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is limited. Some works have also suggested that the weights of large kernel convolution operations can be shared in differentiable neural architecture search. For example, MergeNAS: Merge Operations into One for Differentiable Architecture Search (in IJCAI20)
2. The performance improvements are limited compared with the baselines.

### Questions
1. How to entangle non-parameter operations, such as skip or pooling, as they have no weight compared to convolution.
2. The search cost of original DrNAS is 0.4 GPU-Days in DARTS search space. Whereas, in Table 4, the search time is 29.4 GPU-Hours. Can the authors explain the reason for the different search cost?
3. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind the selection of specific search types, optimizers, and supernet types for the comparative evaluation. 
4. To discuss potential limitations and challenges in implementing the proposed scheme for adapting gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces would provide valuable insights. This could include addressing potential constraints, trade-offs, and practical considerations in real-world implementation.
