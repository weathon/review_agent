## Abstract
Deterministic policies are often preferred over stochastic ones when implemented on physical systems. They can prevent erratic and harmful behaviors while being easier to implement and interpret. However, in practice, exploration is largely performed by stochastic policies.
First-order Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods offer a principled way of performing exploration using deterministic policies. This is done through a learned probabilistic model of the objective function and its gradient. Nonetheless, such approaches treat policy search as a black-box problem, and thus, neglect the reinforcement learning nature of the problem. In this work, we leverage the performance difference lemma to introduce a novel mean function for the probabilistic model. This results in augmenting BO methods with the action-value function. Hence, we call our method Augmented Bayesian Search (ABS).
Interestingly, this new mean function enhances the posterior gradient with the deterministic policy gradient, effectively bridging the gap between BO and policy gradient methods. The resulting algorithm combines the convenience of the direct policy search with the scalability of reinforcement learning.
We validate ABS on high-dimensional locomotion problems and demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing direct policy search schemes.

### Summary
The authors popose Augmented Bayesian policy Search (ABS) a Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL). Typically, BO methods for RL estimate the objective function (dsicounted rewards) using Gaussian Processes (GP) with a constant mean function for the GP prior. In this work the authors propose a new mean function for the GP prior based on empirical estaimtes of the objective function and the advantages between the old policy and new policy. By using this advantage mean function the authors show that the gradient of the posterior takes the form of the deterministic policy gradient corrected by how closely the mean function fits the observed dataset. This approach is theoretically backed by a new bound derived by the aithors that bounds the residual term of a rearranging of the performance difference lemma for Lipschitz MDPs. Finally, the authors also develop an adaptive scheme for aggregating ensembles of Q function estimators based on fitness measure (R-squared) on the whole dataset.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is well motivated and a comprehensive introduction and related work section helps the reader grasp where this research sits in the literature.

(2) The contribution is novel and significant. Specifically, the new bound based on the performance difference lemma for Lipschitz MDPs is convincing and useful (although I haven't thoroughly checked the details on this). The results are also promising and demonstrate good sample complexity.

(3) The algorithm itself is well motivated and theoretically backed, and the evaluation is sufficient enough for me.

(4) To me the paper seems mathematically sound, presented well and well written.

I find this an interesting paper and I'm sure it would be of interest at ICLR, which is why I am recommending it for acceptance. Although since I am not an expert in BO for RL I only feel able to weakly accept this paper. Hopefully a more well read reviewer can see more of the merit of this paper.

### Weaknesses
(1) Quite a lot of prior knowledge is required to understand this paper. I am not immediately familarly with BO methods for RL, perhaps some more intuition for comparison to more familair RL methods may be helpful for the average RL practitioner.

### Questions
I am not familiar with Lipschitz MDPs, presumable the reward function is Lipschitz bounded, but what of the transition functions and policies? Is there a natural way of bounding these that makes sense?

What are the key difference between your approach and the baselines considered in this paper? 

What are the reasons for only considering deterministic policies?

### Summary
This paper presents an elegant BO framework that combines policy gradient and policy evaluation information.  The paper leverages a new construct, the advantage mean function, to improve the typical mean function used in Gaussian processes; this mean function leverages the nature of RL to improve over a naive mean function, and allows the GP to focus its modeling power on second-order residuals.  By jointly modeling the mean and gradient exploration can be improved.

Overall, I really liked this paper. I felt like it presented a strong combination of ideas that are novel, creative, and likely to have impact in the field.

I only gave it a 6 because I have several questions about the method that I could not resolve by reading the paper.

### Strengths
+ An elegant combination of multiple ideas
+ The advantage mean function is a good idea
+ Love the idea of jointly modeling the value and gradient with a single GP
+ Clearly written (although reader needs to be an expert), well-referenced, etc.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is somewhat dense and difficult to parse.
- Empirical results are fine, but could be stronger.

### Questions
I am a little bit worried about the assumption of a linear policy; it was unclear to me if this was for exposition, or a constraint on the algorithm. Could you clarify?

I see that you assume that you have access to J, d, and Q, but not more granular information about observed s,a,r sequences. Why is that? Is that just an assumption that could be relaxed, and if so, would the more granular information be useful in constructing better GP posteriors?

You combine the Q-experts using a softmax of exp(R^2) terms. This seems somewhat ad hoc. Is there a principled reason for this choice?

Resetting the least-performing critic also seems like an ad hoc choice. Is there a principled reason for it?

### Summary
The authors present a new method for policy search, combining local Bayesian optimization with policy search. In essence, they describe novel mean function for a Gaussian process that is derived from the performance difference lemma. 

Overall, the algorithm performs reasonably well and appears to outperform existing methods on some tasks

### Strengths
- the paper is well written, contributions are highlighted, clear experimental questions
- while not easy to follow (one needs to have expertise in many different areas: model-free RL, (local) Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian processes) the author explain their reasoning well
- the experiments  are carried out rigourosly, including repetitions, definition of research questions, etc
- the finding is novel: utilizing the performance difference lemma to derive a more informed mean function to have a better estimate of the performance of neighboring policies is clever (in some ways an informed Taylor approximation)

### Weaknesses
1. minor: The plots can be improved, figure 2-4  is not very pretty (too high linewidth, scrollbar on the right, grid overrides plot)
2. Performance is only marginally better/worse than existing methods

3. This is not a weakness/critique directly but it relates to point 2. Also this point will be a bit opinionated.

I do not believe that the "classical RL setup" of:  exploration towards exploitation(i.e. gradually improving/figuring out the task) is where this method is applied best. Essentially you use the BO + the local mean function interpolation to iteratively improve the policy estimation.    That is why, comparing to "less rigorous/Bayesian" approaches the improvements are not very striking

However, I believe a stronger case can be made if you would look at the method from a risk-sensitive perspective. Your mean function will give you an informed estimate around the known evaluation. The more you move away from that the more the epistemic uncertainty of the probabilitc model will set in. This would enable you to essentially define a "safe zone" around your current estimate.  And your method would have a better informed safe zone compared to other approaches because you leverage the information better using the advantage mean function. Therefore I would expect that your method would still maintain the advantages of a risk-sensitive method (i.e. by monotonic improvement over time) but be more "quick"/greedy compared to traditional risk-sensitive approaches.

4. Related,  conceptually speaking   you make your mean function more informed utilizing the performance difference lemma. This, essentially is a form of interpolation from existing points (i.e. estimating the return of a policy \phi, given knowledge of the return of policy \theta.).  Such knowledge/modelling naturally would go to the kernel function, instead.  The result of your current approach, infusing it in the mean funciton instead,  is that while you mean function is more informed, your covariance function is not.  Therefore, your covariance function will only be a function of the standard kernel function and X.  This means, your estimate of predictive epistemic uncertainty does not take into account the insight "using the knowledge of \theta I can make a more informed guess about the policy \phi". So in my opinion you are still underutilizing the insight described in this paper.

### Questions
Did you see that compared to the baseline your approach gave a more stable/monotonic improvement over time?

### Summary
The paper deals with model-free, bootstrapping-free online RL. It investigates Bayesian optimization for policy search. The new method is compared with two similar methods on six deterministic benchmark MDPs and shows similar results.

### Strengths
* The approach is interesting, I think bootstrapping-free approaches should be given more attention.

### Weaknesses
* There is no comparison with one of the frequently used model-free RL methods with bootstrapping.
* The presentation does not classify the approach clearly enough in the very broad field of RL algorithms.
* The results do not show a clear superiority over the two comparative methods. It is not made sufficiently clear why this approach should nevertheless receive attention.
* The method is only tested on deterministic MDPs without mentioning this limitation.

Further comments:

* The term "deterministic exploration" requires an explanation.

* Regarding "deterministic policy gradient, which changes its actions to maximize Qπθ (Silver et al., 2014)", I would like to note that this principle was already introduced in 2007 in [1].

* "max" should not be italicized, see Algorithm 1.

* The sentence "Evolution of the validation and test scores a representative seed on the MuJoCo task" is incomprehensible.

* The claim "Our learned Q-function can reconstruct the real Q-function" is, in my opinion, not sufficiently substantiated by Figure 2.

* In my opinion, "In the direct policy search literature, an alternative to BO is the use of Evolutionary Strategies" lacks the mention of the use of swarm-based methods such as PSO in [2] and [3].

### Summary
This paper presents a method for policy search/actor critic based on local Bayesian optimization. The main contribution is in the use of a mean function that captures the advantage (critic) of the model  that relates a set of parameters theta with the queried set of parameters x.

### Strengths
The idea of using the recent local Bayesian optimization methods for efficient policy search for high dimensional problems is quite interesting. Furthermore, it is well integrated with the performance difference lemma to enable updates on the information of theta with queries at x. I can see a lot of potential of this work in the community.

### Weaknesses
There are some limitations that can reduce the applicability of this work and make it difficult to understand. For example, it is never explained the type of policy being used. The derivation is based on nonparametric (tabular) policies, but those type of policies are too limited for the MuJoCo experiments. Even the linear policy seems to be very limited.
The idea of incorporating information from x at theta is interesting, but that still requires to sample rollouts from the policy pi_x, which seems counterintutive in a BO setting where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. It seems that the philosophy behind the mean function is similar to having a GP with inducing points. The other advantage of using pi_x seems exploration, but that can also be achieved with importance sampling.
Given the nature of the application (sample efficient PS), the authors should include in the comparison both novel AC methods (SAC, TQC…), model based approaches which are also sample efficient (MBPO…). For example, according to the MBPO paper [A], MBPO is able to achieve 6000 reward in a similar number of steps than ABS gets 4000.

### Questions
-In the paragraph before eq 8, it says “Proposition 3.3”. I think you mean “Theorem 3.3”
-Why all the policies in Figs 3 and 4 are normalized? What do you mean by discounted policy returns? It seems that the undiscounted returns like the ones presented in the appendix are more standard in the literature and allows comparisons with other works. Also, the standard approach is to use steps for the horizontal axis, instead of episodes.
-The R2 analysis is unclear. The fact that for many iterations the correlation is negative and it is mostly below 0.5 means that the fitness might not be accurate. Furthermore, the R2 is a fitness measurement for linear regression, which does not seem to be the case for the Q-function.
-Policy search with Bayesian optimization has been extensively studied since 2007 [B] and there are many works missing. For example, [C] presented a PS method with BO using local models as well, while [D] also combines parametric and non-parametric (GP) models.

After discussion comment: After reading the authors and other reviewers comments, I have decided to increase my rating although there are still some minor problems: R2 analysis relies on some assumptions that are only valid in the linear case and can be deceptive in the nonlinear case [E]

Also, the reference [C] is incorrectly attributed as a particle swarm algorithm. In my previous comment, I meant PS as in policy search, not particle swarm. Apologies for the confusion.
