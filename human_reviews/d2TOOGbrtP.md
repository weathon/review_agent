- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Domain invariant learning aims to learn models that extract invariant features over various training domains, resulting in better generalization to unseen target domains. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks have achieved promising results in domain invariant learning, but most works concentrate on aligning features distributions rather than parameter distributions. Inspired by the principle of Bayesian Neural Network, we attempt to directly learn the domain invariant posterior distribution of network parameters. We first propose a theorem to show that the invariant posterior of parameters can be implicitly inferred by aggregating posteriors on different training domains. Our assumption is more relaxed and allows us to extract more domain invariant information. We also propose a simple yet effective method, named PosTerior Generalization (PTG), that can be used to estimate the invariant parameter distribution. PTG fully exploits variational inference to approximate parameter distributions, including the invariant posterior and the posteriors on training domains. Furthermore, we develop a lite version of PTG for widespread applications. PTG shows competitive performance on various domain generalization benchmarks on DomainBed. Additionally, PTG can use any existing domain generalization methods as its prior, and combined with previous state-of-the-art method the performance can be further improved. Code will be made public.

### Summary
This paper proposes to directly learn the domain invariant posterior distribution of network parameters. The theoretical analysis shows that the invariant posterior of parameters can be implicitly inferred by aggregating posteriors on different training domains. Accordingly, this paper proposes a simple yet effective method, named PosTerior Generalization (PTG), that can be used to estimate the invariant parameter distribution.

### Strengths
This paper introduces parameter posterior distributions into domain generalization for the first time. And propose two simple yet effective domain generalization methods named Posterior Generalization based on their theories. 
The proposed method is simple in theory and algorithm implementation, yet effective as shown by the empirical studies.

### Weaknesses
There are some typos, and the writing can be improved.

### Questions
1.	Please give clear definitions of $\omega$ and $\theta_i$. How they are related, and how they determine $f_i(\dot)$. 
2.	In equations (4), (5) and (6), the notations of expectation and variance do not follow the convention of probability theory. The reviewer fails to figure out what the expectation is taken of, and with respect to what. Even when the reviewer turns to the appendix, it is difficult to understand because $\theta$ and $\omega$ is not clearly defined. The reviewer understands it as the follows: $\omega$ is the model parameter, like the weight of a neural network? $\theta$ corresponds to the mean, $\mu$, and variance, \sigma, when the variational distribution takes Gaussian distribution form.  But if it is the case, by variational inference, \theta is a function of $\omega$ determined by the model (e.g., a neural network); then, how to understand $q(\omega|\theta_i)$. Maybe when your model (the neural network) is not a deterministic model, meaning, both $\omega$ and $\theta$ are random, the above seems right. 
3.	The proposed algorithm needs to train a featurizer for each domain. It is computationally expensive.

### Summary
The paper proposes a posterior generalization method for domain invariant learning. Different from the previous methods that do invariant learning on features, the proposed method directly infers the invariant posterior of the parameters by posterior aggregation. The authors also propose a lite version of posterior generalization for widespread applications. Experiments on DomainNet show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The idea of directly inferring the invariant posterior of the model parameters is novel and interesting.

2. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the idea is interesting, it is still unclear why directly inferring the domain invariant model posteriors is better than feature invariant learning. The authors argue that the proposed method can extract more invariant information from features but the reason is also not clear.

2. As the author posted, the proposed method is not memory efficient since BNNs require more parameters than the deterministic models.

### Questions
It seems there are three stages of PTG, first pre-training the BNN models by ERM, then learning source domain-specific posteriors, at last generating the invariant posterior and training the classifier. It is better to make this procedure clear in the paper for easier following. And there are some details also need to be clarified. 

1. Before pretrained on the source domains by ERM, is the BNN parameters initialized randomly or by ImageNet pretrained parameters? 

2. In eq.(4), what are the mean and variance for each BNN convolutional layer? are they channel-wise vectors or scalers?

3. once obtained the mean and variance of the invariant posterior f_0, how to sample the parameters? By Monte-Carlo sampling?

4. In the algorithm, I found that in each training iteration, the source-specific posterior f_i is updated first, then the method aggregates them as the invariant posteriors and trains it together with the classifiers. However, in the next iterations, the f_i is updated again without considering any information in f_0, and f_0 is updated according to the new f_i, also without the f_0 in the previous iterations. If it is, why need to update f_0 by the cross-entropy loss functions?

### Summary
The work focuses on tackling domain generalization from the view of parameter posterior learning, aiming to extract invariant “information” for better generalization across training domains. Their work is built upin Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), the approach directly learns domain invariant posterior distributions of network parameters. A theorem (conditional distribution marginalization) shows implicit learning of invariant posteriors by aggregating network parameter posteriors from different domains, allowing for a relaxed assumption. The proposed PosTerior Generalization (PTG) employs variational inference to estimate the invariant parameter distribution, demonstrating competitive performance on diverse benchmarks. The proposed PTG is built upon the existing DG methods, where PTG needs the existing DG methods to provide initilization for their parameter posterior aggregation.

### Strengths
1. The explanation of the intractability of the defined problem is clear, offering a compelling rationale for employing variational inference to estimate the posterior density.

2. The paper is well-written with a clear flow to understand the proposed PTG.

### Weaknesses
## Majors:

1. The lack of definitions for "parameter" and "feature" leaves me puzzled about the proposed method. What constitutes the samples of the posterior after the training of the Bayesian neural net converges—model parameters, latent features, or something else entirely? Furthermore, clarity is needed on the dimensionality of the samples from the proposed posterior.

2. There is no need to present p(w|D^{c}) = E_{p(D^{v})}(p(w|D^{c}, D^{v})) as a theorem; it is a standard statistical technique known as marginalization. Routine operations in statistics, like this, do not necessitate proof.

3. I could not identify any specific contributions made by the authors in this paper. It reads more like a review of Bayesian methods in domain generalization. The claimed theorem appears to be about the marginalization of conditional distributions. I am interested in the authors' elaboration on this during the rebuttal.

4. I'm sensing a concern about the assumption that \mathcal{D}_{c} ​ remains constant across the entire dataset \mathcal{D}, especially given the notation \mathcal{D}_{i}^{N} ​ mentioned by the authors. It seems the authors are questioning whether there can be a subset of data within one dataset that is fully domain-specific or domain-invariant, as opposed to only certain features (latent encoded outputs) being domain-invariant. Consequently, I find the motivation behind the proposed work to be lacking. Let us break it down. The authors seem to suggest that \mathcal{D}_{c} remains consistent throughout \mathcal{D}, where \mathcal{D}_{i}^{N} ​ represents subsets of data within the dataset. The authors point out that there is a subset of samples that are domain-specific or invariant rather than there is part of feature elements within entire data samples that are domain-specific or invariant (e.g., In the conventional understanding, we acknowledge that images of dogs often exhibit diverse background information, which can be seen as domain-specific. Simultaneously, the outlines or features of dogs themselves are considered domain-invariant. However, the authors introduce the idea that within the broader category of dogs, there should be a subset of images that are specifically tied to a domain or completely domain-invariant. This assertion does not seem to align with the typical variability observed in dog images, and I find it challenging to envision such a subset existing within this category). This leads to a potential misalignment in the assumption. If the proposed work relies on the idea that certain data samples are entirely domain-specific within a dataset, it might not be well-grounded. It might be more accurate to frame the motivation around features being domain-invariant rather than assuming entire data samples share this characteristic. In essence, it appears there's room for clarification or adjustment in the assumption to better reflect the reality of domain invariance within datasets. This refinement would strengthen the motivation behind the proposed approach.

5. The literature compared in this study appears to be somewhat outdated, with the highlighted method, SOTA CORAL, dating back to 2017. Given that the proposed method relies on an existing domain generalization (DG) method for initialization, it becomes crucial to benchmark against more recent approaches. It would be particularly insightful to demonstrate how the proposed method not only aligns with but also enhances the state-of-the-art frameworks in domain generalization. Please consider conducting comparisons with the latest methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of your proposed approach in the context of contemporary DG frameworks.

## Minors:

1. The authors should perform an ablation study to assess the performance of the proposed PTG without relying on other domain generalization (DG) methods for initialization. For instance, evaluating PTG using only the pre-trained ResNet-18 as the initialization for model training on each domain would provide insights into its standalone effectiveness.

2. Correct the grammatical errors, for example, on page 4, section 3.2, the proof should be "shown" instead of "show."

### Questions
1. The authors in section 3.3 suggest initializing the BNN on each domain with a uniformly well-generalized model, such as a BNN trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The confusion arises regarding the connection between initializing the model on each domain and selecting the best model through ERM. To clarify, the authors advocate training a BNN using ERM on a specific dataset before initializing it on different domains. The dataset used for this ERM training is not explicitly mentioned in this section, but it is the dataset that provides the well-generalized model used as the starting point for initialization across various domains. In essence, the ERM-trained BNN serves as a kind of starting point. It is trained on a particular dataset that captures general patterns. My understanding is that this well-generalized model is then employed as the initial configuration for the BNN when dealing with different domains. The emphasis is on using a model that has already demonstrated good generalization capabilities through ERM, ensuring a solid starting point for adaptation to diverse domains.

2. The terminologies used in the paper are confusing. In the introduction, the authors equate domain-invariant features to domain-invariant parameters. In typical deep-learning contexts, parameters refer to learnable model weights and biases, while features denote the encoder's output. To prevent potential misinterpretations, it would be helpful if the authors could offer clear definitions for parameters and features within the scope of their work.

3. Could you provide clarity on the definition of the prior model in the proposed work? Is it initialized from the pretraining of ResNet, or is it initialized from the pretraining of another domain generalization (DG) method? Please elaborate on this aspect.

4. Could you specify the space in which domain-invariant and domain-specific information is defined? Is it in the input space, latent space, or output probability space? If it's in the input space, how does \mathcal{D} change? If it's in the latent and output spaces, how does p(\mathcal{D}^{c}) remain constant? Clarification on this aspect would enhance understanding.

5. In Algorithm 1, when the authors mention updating the model parameters with a Gaussian distribution, are they referring to sampling the model parameters from the Gaussian distribution outlined in Equation (4)? If so, could you provide clarification on the method used for this sampling process? Is it achieved through random sampling? Please provide additional details.

6. In Figure 2, the authors mention extracting domain-invariant information from domain-specific features (Z^V). Given that these features reside in the encoded space (the output space of ResNet-18) if the training of ResNet-18 is indeed effective in extracting domain-invariant features, it raises a question: How can domain-invariant information also be present within features specifically identified as domain-specific? The term "information" is used without a clear definition from the authors. This ambiguity, coupled with an unclear definition of \mathcal{D}, restricts readers from fully grasping the paper's content. Could the authors provide more clarity on interpreting "information" and a more explicit definition of \mathcal{D}? My understanding is that the authors are trying to claim that the feature map might not effectively capture the domain-invariant information from the data. If my understanding is correct, then the claim is very ambiguous. The authors should at least provide some ways to quantify or visualize it. In the current version of the paper, this claim is not supported theoretically or empirically.

### Summary
This paper investigates a new approach to domain invariant learning using Bayesian neural networks. In particular, the paper first considers a theorem to show that the invariant posterior of parameters can be implicitly inferred by aggregating posteriors on different training domains. This theorem is under an assumption that the domain invariant information $\mathcal{D}^{c}$ and the domain-specific information $\mathcal{D}^{v}$ are independent. Based on this, the paper proposes a method named Posterior Generalization (PTG) and its lite version to estimate the distribution of the invariant posterior. The proposed method is validated on some benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The code is provided and will be public. 
- The experimental results are good at least from Table 1.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is not very sound as it attempts to consider learning domain invariants using the Bayesian framework on the parameter space. This is different from the existing work where the feature space is considered. However, this may lead to challenging problems as the parameters of neural networks are extremely high-dimensional and unidentifiable. It is extremely difficult to align and aggregate the posteriors in the parameter space. Therefore, the authors propose some ad-hoc solutions in Section 3.3 such as neural networks for different domains should be initialized from the same point, the parameters of the last layer should be shared between neural networks, and the learning rate should be carefully decayed. These solutions are not well-motivated and do not guarantee that the posteriors of parameters are well-aligned and aggregated properly.
- The authors propose PTG-Lite, which is a lite version of the main method. Due to the difficulty of employing Bayesian treatment to the neural network’s parameters, PTG-Lite just uses maximum-a-posteriori MAP solutions. We can see from Table 1 that PTG-Lite performs comparably with PTG. This somehow downgrades the main narrative of the paper which is to propose a Bayesian framework for aggregating posteriors on domains and inferring domain invariant posteriors.
- One of the main contributions is the Theorem 3.1. However, it is trivial. Although the authors claim in the abstract that this theorem relies on relaxed assumptions. However, the assumption of full independence between the domain invariant and domain-specific information is quite strong.
- The authors should experimentally compare with other approaches using Bayesian neural networks such as Xiao et al. (2021) and follow-up works.
- The writing should be improved. There are some citation and grammar typos and sentences that need further clarification. For example, in the second row from the bottom of page 3, what are the parameters?

### Questions
- In Section 3.1, the paper claims that “we do not need to specify how $\mathcal{D}^{c}$ and $\mathcal{D}^{v}$ are extracted from $\mathcal{D}$”. Is this useful as it would be important to learn which information from the data is invariant or not? Is it possible to interpret the inferred domain-invariant posterior?
- In Equations (5) and (7), what are the expectations with respect to?
