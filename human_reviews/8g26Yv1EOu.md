- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Excitatory point processes (i.e., event flows) occurring over dynamic graphs (i.e., evolving topologies) provide a fine-grained model to capture how discrete events may spread over time and space. How to effectively steer the event flows by modifying the dynamic graph structures presents an interesting problem, motivated by curbing the spread of infectious diseases through strategically locking down cities to mitigating traffic congestion via traffic light optimization. To address the intricacies of planning and overcome the high dimensionality inherent to such decision-making problems, we design an Amortized Network Interventions (ANI) framework, allowing for the pooling of optimal policies from history and other contexts while ensuring a permutation equivalent property. This property enables efficient knowledge transfer and sharing across diverse contexts. Each task is solved by an H-step lookahead model-based reinforcement learning, where neural ODEs are introduced to model the dynamics of the excitatory point processes. Instead of simulating rollouts from the dynamics model, we derive an analytical mean-field approximation for the event flows given the dynamics, making the online planning more efficiently solvable. We empirically illustrate that this ANI approach substantially enhances policy learning for unseen dynamics and exhibits promising outcomes in steering event flows through network intervention using synthetic and real COVID datasets.

### Summary
The paper proposed a model-based reinforcement learning approach to model networked point processes. Considerations are given on the scalability of the proposed method. The paper describes an amortized policy approach to deal with the scalability issue. The proposed method is applied to synthetic data, real-world covid data, and real-world traffic data.

### Strengths
* originality: the problem formulation of networked point processes described by the author has some originality. 
* quality: the proposed method makes sense to me. The scalability issue is highlighted in particular. I think the scalability issue is an important one to make the algorithm pratical. The authors proposed the use of amortized policy to deal with this issue.
* presentaiton is clear. I can follow the rationale of the paper.
significance: the proposed method is associated with application scenarios of high significance.

### Weaknesses
* I appreciate the authors applying their proposed method to two important pratical problems. However, I think the paper can benefit from comparison to alternative methods. 

* Using intensity cost as the evaluation metric is also somewhat obscured.

### Questions
* Is it possible for the authors to describe the potential limitation due to the use of mean field approximation for reward modeling?
* Are there experiments to demonstrate the incorporation of fairness constraints and more?
* "For instance, when regulating the coronavirus, government interventions must balance health concerns with economic implications and public sentiment." It is not clear whether the experiments described in the paper achieve such a balance.

### Summary
The paper discusses a method for addressing the challenge of large-scale network intervention in scenarios like controlling the spread of infectious diseases or managing traffic congestion. The approach uses model-based reinforcement learning with neural ODEs to predict how excitatory processes in a network will change over time as the network structure evolves. It incorporates Gradient-Descent based Model Predictive Control (GD-MPC) to provide flexibility in policy development, accommodating prior knowledge and constraints. To handle complex planning problems with high dimensionality, the authors introduce an Amortize Network Interventions (ANI) framework, which allows pooling of optimal policies from historical data and various contexts while ensuring efficient knowledge transfer. This method has broad applications, including disease control and traffic optimization.

### Strengths
The paper is well-motivated and the proposed model is technically sound and can notably handle large-scale systems. The overall writing is easy to follow. The experiment section is comprehensive though missing some baselines.

### Weaknesses
In the experiment section, why baseline comparison is only limited on one synthetic dataset? Also, can the author explains why the NHPI baseline almost have a constant intensity cost in Figure 1?

### Questions
For adding interventions, can we also consider causal-inference-based methods as valid comparison?

### Summary
This paper proposes a re-enforcement learning algorithm to adaptively change the network structure to steer the observed event counts over a potentially large network. The proposed algorithm is carefully crafted to model network point process data with complicated data structures, which is desirable for solving large-scale real-data applications. The proposed algorithm is theoretically sound, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data applications.

### Strengths
The paper is well written, the presentation is clear and the idea is sound.

### Weaknesses
More details are needed in some components of the proposed model, including the mean field approximation for the rewarding model and the construction of the amortized policy.

### Questions
1. The review of the work on networked excitatory point processes seems to only focus on work that used ODEs. However, I would like to point out that there are also other streams of research on networked excitatory point processes, for example, [1], [2], [3]. It is better to conduct a more comprehensive review of the topic.

2. In the definition of the temporal graph network, what are the definitions of edges in the two examples given in the paper? I do not find formal definitions. Could you please clarify?

3. On page 3, it is claimed that the "high-dimensional event sequences $\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ has a stationary dynamics". What do you mean by "stationary"? If $X_t$ is the accumulated counts up to time $t$, it is unlikely to be a stationary time series. Please clarify.

4. Is the influence matrix $W$ in equation~(4) a given matrix or learned from the data?

5. The use of mean field approximation on page 4 seems to be rather ad-hoc, without much theoretical or even heuristic justifications. Can you give an example to show the difference between the actual reward and the one calculated based on the mean-field approximation? Are they actually close? Perhaps some simulation studies can be carried out to show the difference in actual reduction in intensity using these two reward objectives in some simple settings.

6. On page 5, it is stated that "Given a sequence of local policies $\{\pi_i\}$, $1\le i\le M$,  addressing $M$ distinct sub-problems, our goal is to create an amortized policy $\pi_{amo}$". However, I did not find any detail on how this goal can be achieved. Can you clarify?

7. The label of the y-axis in Figure 3 reads "Intensity Cost". What is the definition of the "Intensity Cost"?

### Summary
The paper looks at both the learning and optimal intervention planning problem for a large-scale network whose evolutions include both continuous state drift and discrete jumps. The authors propose to learn the transition of the states via MLE. Directly dealing with the large-scale problem is intractable. Hence, the authors also propose the Amortized Policy Learning framework to 
1) segment the network into pieces and each time pick one subnetwork to update the model estimation;
2) update the policy parameters with data collected from the current subnetwork using common feature representation learned by minimizing the bi-contrastive loss. 

The authors apply the proposed framework to tasks including synthetic data, covid data and traffic data where improvements are obtained and show that the proposed policy equivalent embeddings successfully decouple the position embeddings and value embeddings.

### Strengths
The authors' contributions include: 
1) Formulate the problem as a RL problem.
2) Propose to decompose the problem into subproblems of smaller scale and learn a policy that can generalize to the full-scale problem via   ensuring permutation equivalence. 
3) Test and compare the methods to previous methods on several settings of practical interest. Also, the authors show concrete evidence of the out-of-distribution generalization power of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
In my point of view, the authors did not clarify their contributions. 

In terms of problem formulation, modeling the discrete events by counting the occurrences in a time window should not be counted as the novelty. In terms of model learning, the authors are basically using the MLE method, which is standard in model-based RL. 
Policy learning within the permutation equivalence class through learning embedding $p^t, m^t$ via contrastive method is an interesting idea. However, the authors do not differentiate their work from (Chen et al., 2020b).

More crucially, each part in a large networks may have both global and local patterns. How to deal with the local patterns in model learning and policy optimization is not clear. Or the authors are just trying to obtain a policy that only has "overall" good performance.

Another question is how to deal with the soft/hard constraints. I did not find evidence supporting the effectiveness of the constraint ensuring methods.

### Questions
As I have mentioned before, is it possible for the current framework to capture the local patterns in a large network and perhaps steer the learned policy towards local patterns while maintaining the generalization power (such as regularized policy optimization).
