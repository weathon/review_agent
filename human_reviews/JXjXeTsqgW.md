- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a rich history of utilizing natural herbs to treat a diversity of illnesses. In practice, TCM diagnosis and treatment are highly personalized and organically holistic, requiring comprehensive consideration of the patient's state and symptoms over time. However, existing TCM recommendation approaches overlook the changes in patient status and only explore potential patterns between symptoms and prescriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel Sequential Condition Evolved Interaction Knowledge Graph (SCEIKG), a framework that treats the model as a sequential prescription-making problem by considering the dynamics of the patient's condition across multiple visits. In addition, we incorporate an interaction knowledge graph to enhance the accuracy of recommendations by considering the interactions between different herbs and the patient's condition. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing TCM recommendation methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Summary
The existing Chinese medicine recommendation methods ignore the changes in the patient's condition. The author of this article proposes a Sequential Condition Evolved Interaction Knowledge Graph(SCEIKG), which comprehensively considers the dynamic changes in the patient's condition and formulates questions in a sequential manner. It also takes into account the effects of different herbs and the patient's condition to enhance the accuracy of the recommendations.

### Strengths
It comprehensively considers the dynamic changes in the patient's condition and innovatively proposes a framework to address this issue.
By adding an interactive knowledge graph to improve accuracy is an interesting contribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms current approaches.

### Weaknesses
In Section 5， the dataset used in this study is relatively small, covering only 751 patient records and prescriptions, all of which are from Guangdong province. This may result in limitations to the model's generalizability. The patient’s state transfer is implicit so it may be professional errors in the dataset that are difficult to detect. The paper can discuss the limitations and potential biases of the dataset.

In Appendix A.1， Insufficient evaluation of the knowledge graph: This article utilizes a knowledge graph embedding method that combines TransR with RotatE.Different knowledge graph completion methods may have different impacts on the results. This article does not provide comprehensive evaluation results for the generated knowledge graph. The quality and accuracy of the knowledge graph are very important for the subsequent tasks.

In Section 4， this article introduces a module to predict changes in patient condition but does not explain the accuracy of this prediction. It can also clarify how SCEIKG handles patient-specific changes to better understand and model individual differences, which may help improve the accuracy of the model and personalized recommendation ability.

In Appendix D， This article mentions the issue of herb compatibility in herbal recommendations but does not provide specific solutions to address this compatibility problem.

Overall, the paper presents an innovative approach to TCM recommendation, but further clarity and validation are needed. The use of interaction graphs is promising, but practical implications should be explored in more detail.

### Questions
Can we increase the reason for recommendations to enhance the interpretability of the model? The interpretability of the model is very important for both doctors and patients, which may enhance its practicality.

### Summary
The paper focus on the problem of Traditional Chinese Medicine Recommendation which is formalized as a sequential prescription-making problem. Further, the paper introduces a methods named SCEIKG, which considers dynamics of patients' conditions across multiple diagnoses. In addition, an interaction knowledge graph is utilized to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. The SCEIKG contains three major modules, a heterogeneous graph neural network which combines a hierarchical attention message passing layer and a knowledge graph embedding layer, a horizontal conditional module which is used to extract the patient’s status, and a transition condition module to model the patients’ progression. The experiments are conducted on one real-world dataset to show the proposed methods' performance.

### Strengths
1.The paper focus on the problem of Tradition Chinese Medicine Recommendation, which is an important problem in medical data mining literature.     
2.The proposed method utilizes domain knowledge to enhance the recommendation of traditional Chinese medicine.     
3.The experimental results show the advantages of the proposed method on the real-world dataset.

### Weaknesses
1.The motivations of the paper needs to be clarified. The differences between Traditional Chinese Medicine Recommendation and General Medicine Recommendation should be emphasized. The author may want to explain these differences. Besides, it seems that the proposed method can be adopted into any other medicine recommendation setting. The author may need to stress the motivations.       
2.The novelty of the paper is limited. The progress of knowledge fusion is by introducing a regularization into the loss function, which is trivial in the literature. Besides, what is the motivation of the module TRANSITION CONDITION MODULE?  Actually, modeling patients’ dynamics in drug recommendation has been already addressed, such as. The author may need to discuss the difference.       
3.The structure of the paper needs to be improved. The method is called Sequential Condition Evolved Interaction Knowledge Graph Learning. However, there is no formal definition of what an Interaction Knowledge Graph(IKG) is. The author may want to declare it.       
4.For experiments, the method is only conducted on one dataset. Evaluations on more dataset should be conducted. The proposed method seems to be a general framework for drug recommendation. Therefore, the author may need to show the results on common datasets.

### Questions
1. What is IKG？ Is there any difference between common KGs and IKGs?      
2. What is the difference between Traditional Medicine Recommendation and general medicine recommendation? It seems that the proposed method can be used in general medicine recommendation setting. The author may need to point out the differences.

### Summary
This paper claims the traditional Chinese medicine practices are not treating the individual symptoms as well as lack of standardization. The paper points out a. the existing herb recommendation approaches are neglecting the long term effect that could potentially affected by the recommended medication; b. existing approach only relying on diagnose data set and pretrained domain knowledge thus cannot capture the intricate relation between symptom and herb. To address these issues, this paper proposed a three-module herb recommendation system that fuses information form domain knowledge graph, user's diagnosis, symptom, mediation history sequential information, as well as the predicted repercussion of the herb that about to be recommended. The paper reports the empirical comparison between the proposed approach and non-trivial baselines, and achieves best performance in 2/3 of the reported metrics. Case study and module wise ablation study are also provided.

__Initial Recommendation__: Weak reject. Please see weak points for the key reasons.

### Strengths
* The proposed three modules are sensible in terms of addressing the claimed existing shortcomings
* The reported experiment shows the potential of the proposed approach over the existing herb recommendation approaches.

### Weaknesses
* The long term effect of the items being recommended on the user has been studied under quite a few subarea in the recommender system.  Reinforcement learning (e.g., Interactive collaborative filtering), Counterfactual Reasoning (e.g., Unbiased learning-to-rank with biased feedback), as well as Evolving user profiles (e.g., Dynamic Poisson factorization) are some examples. Taking into long term effect is one of the main contribution claimed in the paper, yet the proposed module is not well positioned.
* Drug-Drug interaction is one of the major factor to be considered when performing drug recommendation (e.g, Wu et al., Conditional generation net for medication recommendation) in order to avoid harmful effects. The proposed approach does not take this information into consideration. As also show in the case study, the proposed proposed approach recommended quite a few herbs that does not matches doctors prescription, considering Drug-Drug interaction would be crucial for risk minimization.

### Questions
* How to position the proposed long term effect prediction module in related literature?
* How does the proposed approach mitigate the risk that would caused by harmful drug-drug interactions?

### Summary
This paper proposed a framework for traditional Chinese medicine recommendation. The proposed SCEIKG method leverages additional knowledge through incorporating IKG, and predicts the patients’ next visit state. As a result, it shows SOTA performance on a private dataset.

### Strengths
1.	The task of this paper to recommend traditional Chinese medicine with deep learning method is important.
2.	The idea of predicting next visit patient state is interesting and effective.
3.	The proposed method outperforms baselines on most metrics on a private dataset.

### Weaknesses
1.	The theoretical novelty is limited.
2.	The dataset for experiment is rather small.
3.	The presentation of method can be refined to make it easier to be understood.
4.	It’s not clear how the KG is completed and whether the predicted edges are reasonable. The effectiveness of incorporating IKG also needs to be clarified.

### Questions
1.	The font size in figures is generally too small. Especially Fig. 2, which is important for model understanding.
2.	It’s recommended to define loss function (L_{IKG}, L_{mse}, etc.) in 4.1-4.3 to make the method easier to be understood.
3.	In Fig. 3, method w/o IKG performs comparable with SCEIKG and even better on some metrics. Does the IKG really work?
4.	In Fig. 3, method w/o sequence performs very poor, which is confusing, as doctor can prescribe accurately even without any historical information. A successful AI system should also be robust to patient without historical information.
5.	If you can consider adverse drug-disease or drug-drug interaction, it will be a great contribution.
6.	It’s recommended to include metric ‘Jaccard’ to verify the set recommendation accuracy of the proposed method.
