- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 6, 6

## Abstract
Among the array of neural network architectures, the Vision Transformer (ViT) stands out as a prominent choice, acclaimed for its exceptional expressiveness and consistent high performance in various vision applications. Recently, the emerging Spiking ViT approach has endeavored to harness spiking neurons, paving the way for a more brain-inspired transformer architecture that thrives in ultra-low power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. Nevertheless, this approach remains confined to spatial self-attention and doesn't fully unlock the potential of spiking neural networks.
We introduce DISTA, a Denoising Spiking Transformer with Intrinsic Plasticity and SpatioTemporal Attention, designed to maximize the spatiotemporal computational prowess of spiking neurons, particularly for vision applications. DISTA explores two types of spatiotemporal attentions: intrinsic neuron-level attention and network-level attention with explicit memory. Additionally, DISTA incorporates an efficient nonlinear denoising mechanism to quell the noise inherent in computed spatiotemporal attention maps, thereby resulting in further performance gains. Our DISTA transformer undergoes joint training involving synaptic plasticity (i.e., weight tuning) and intrinsic plasticity (i.e., membrane time constant tuning) and delivers state-of-the-art performances across several static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. With only 6 time steps, DISTA achieves remarkable top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 (96.26\%) and CIFAR100 (79.15\%), as well as 79.1\% on CIFAR10-DVS using 10 time steps.

### Weaknesses
The biggest flaw is training for 1000 Epochs on CIFAR100 and CIFAR10.

The algorithm demonstrates improvements on performance on both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets; however, the improvement on CIFAR100 is not that significant, and it has not been assessed on larger datasets like ImageNet.

Lacking details on complexity, parameters etc.

### Questions
Why the model converge so slow (1000 Epochs)

How's the performance on ImageNet

Is there any improvements on PLIF or just grab it without any changes

Please add the analysis on complexity, parameters etc

### Summary
The paper introduces DISTA, a novel architecture for spiking neural networks (SNNs) aiming to improve their performance on vision tasks by utilizing spatiotemporal attention mechanisms.

### Strengths
+ Innovative Architecture: DISTA innovates by integrating spatiotemporal attention at both neuron and network levels, along with a denoising mechanism, which leads to state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.

+ Energy Efficiency: By leveraging the inherent efficiencies of SNNs and denoising mechanisms, DISTA promises to improve energy efficiency, which is crucial for neuromorphic computing.

+ Biologically Inspired: The approach takes inspiration from the biological brain, potentially opening up new avenues for understanding neural processing.

+ High Accuracy: DISTA achieves remarkable accuracy improvements on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating the potential of SNNs in complex tasks.

+ Backpropagation Integration: The paper integrates backpropagation-based synaptic and intrinsic plasticity into SNNs, enhancing their learning capabilities.

### Weaknesses
- Novelty: I may have missed something, but most of the approach is taken from the spikeformer paper. This work mainly taken the temporal attention window which results in an increase in number of parameters and that may be the reason why the authors get accuracy improvement. I am not sure if the temporal attention has anything to do with it. If yes, it ll be good if the authors can elaborate. Further,there is no result on imagenet dataset. I feel the reason why authors didn't do it was the temporal attention ll explode the overall parameter requirement which becomes unmanageable in alarge dataset. On the other hand, the original spikeformer work has imagenet results. Kindly clarify the scalability of your approach or discuss its limitations.

- Specificity of Application: While DISTA shows significant improvements in vision tasks, its adaptability to other types of tasks is not demonstrated. Can the authors comment on this?

- Overfitting Risk: There's a potential risk of overfitting as the model complexity increases with multiple attention mechanisms, though this is not explicitly discussed in the paper. Can the authors provide their opinion on this?

- Can the authors do some off the shelf energy estimations maybe by using some spiking hardware simulator tools like [1] (its understandable if the authors are not able to do it fully, a qualitative discussion on the efficiency benefits- as in whether they expect sparsity advantage at compute level or memory storage reduction from a hardware point of view will be useful) ? I will be interested to see if their DISTA is actually energy efficient (specifically in terms of memory energy).

### Summary
The authors have tackled a rather interesting and important problem, which is to design/improve spiking neural networks-based vision transformers. More specifically, the authors have proposed a spiking transformer model that provides node-level and network-wide spatiotemporal attention with denoising. In this work, they consider, a simple yet effective, neuromorphic model called Leaky Integrate-and-Fire that makes use of the temporal information that decays over time. They incorporated a learnable time constant to be used in LIF and a thresholding-based efficient denoising technique. The experiments show a significant improvement over their predecessor, Spikformer.

### Strengths
Originality 
- Incorporating spiking neural networks with the vision transformers is a very recent yet challenging issue. The authors are expanding on the work of Spikformer [1]. Even that work is very recent. The main objective of the paper is to make efficient spiking transformers that take advantage of temporal information.  Previous work is lacking in this regard; however, the authors have tackled this issue and improved the approach. They also involve a denoising technique for the accumulated spatiotemporal maps since they do not use a rather complicated function Softmax. Therefore, I believe this work is reasonably new and the concept itself deserves more attention. 

Quality
- Spiking neural networks, more or less, mimic biological networks. Of course, it all depends on the biological plausibility of the models. For example, leaky integrate and fire models are very efficient neuromorphic models; however, compared to the Hodgkin-Huxley model, they are comparatively less biologically plausible. Thus said, current neuromorphic hardware does take advantage of the concept of LIF models to develop an SNN-based chip, and these models are not just space-efficient but also energy-efficient.
- Given the progression in transformers, the authors of this paper have shown that making transformers more biologically plausible can indeed have significant advantages over the other neuromorphic approaches. They do so by comparing against the most recent Spikformer [1], and other neuromorphic approaches with variable time steps.
- Specifically, the authors have integrated learnable time-constant (tau), which is a very important parameter in LIF that decides the significance of the input at the current time-step to the future ones. Further, to make the spatiotemporal attention mechanism less computationally expensive, the spiking networks have discarded Softmax masking, instead, the authors have used a threshold-based masking technique that significantly reduces the computational overhead.
- The authors have shown significant improvement over the other baseline approaches, and have done extensive ablation studies. 

Clarity
- The paper is well-written and straightforward. The objective is clearly stated and tackled reasonably well throughout the paper.

Significance
- Since this approach is tackling a very recent and significant challenge of making neural networks more energy-efficient using spiking neural networks, it could have a good impact on the current research.

### Weaknesses
Concerns:
- There are a few things that the authors discussed in the paper; however, are not fully tackled. 
  - Spiking networks by nature use less energy to function since they take advantage of the temporal coding. The authors have discussed this and it is one of the core reasons the community is interested in this, it would be interesting to perform a comparative analysis on hardware to test this approach. The authors have only discussed the accuracy of the approach.
  - Another thing would be space complexity. There should also be a comparative analysis of the space complexity of the approach. 
- To get a better idea of the significance of the approach, comparative analysis on large benchmarks such as ImageNet would also be interesting to observe.
  - There are many hyperparameters involved: 𝜭, u, t, etc.

### Questions
The approach signifies the importance of spiking transformers; however, to fully exploit the potential of this approach, I believe, there are certain things to be considered:
- As mentioned in the weakness section, the paper does lack a rather important comparative analysis of energy-efficiency as mentioned. Please consider that as a measure of performance since it is one of the most crucial properties of the SNNs. 
- I believe, with further analysis of the efficiency, this paper could be a good contribution to the vision community.
