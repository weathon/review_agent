# Function-space Parameterization of Neural Networks for Sequential Learning

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Sequential learning paradigms pose challenges for gradient-based deep learning due to difficulties incorporating new data and retaining prior knowledge. While Gaussian processes elegantly tackle these problems, they struggle with scalability and handling rich inputs, such as images. To address these issues, we introduce a technique that converts neural networks from weight space to function space, through a dual parameterization. Our parameterization offers: (*i*) a way to scale function-space methods to large data sets via sparsification, (*ii*) retention of prior knowledge when access to past data is limited, and (*iii*) a mechanism to incorporate new data without retraining. Our experiments demonstrate that we can retain knowledge in continual learning and incorporate new data efficiently. We further show its strengths in uncertainty quantification and guiding exploration in model-based RL. Further information and code is available on the project website.

### Summary
This paper extends recent dual parameterization approaches for sparse GPs to function space inference for neural networks. This allows for efficient uncertainty estimation and the authors further formulate a continual learning objective as well as a variation that allows for incorporating new data without retraining. The experiments report competitive performance compared to Laplace- and GP-based baselines from the literature for uncertainty estimation on MNIST and CIFAR scale datasets, continual learning on MNIST and model-based reinforcement learning for the cart pole mujoco challenge.

Overall, the paper is quite rich and in terms of its technical contribution more than sufficient for a conference paper. Unfortunately, there is almost so much going on that the paper lacks in clarity and focus. The experiments tend to be somewhat small scale, so that I find it hard to argue for acceptance on a purely quantitative basis, and qualitatively the most interesting aspect - the possibility of incorporating new data without re-training - is mostly an afterthought in the empirical evaluation.

All things considered, I would lean towards rejection at this point, but with a thorough update of the manuscript would hope to increase my score over the course of the rebuttal.

EDIT: in light of the rebuttal, I would now tend towards acceptance.

### Strengths
- there is quite a lot going on technically, extending recent dual parameterization methods for GPs to neural networks not only for uncertainty estimation, but also continual learning
- there is a wide range of experiments, I would not have expected the model-based RL benchmark on top of the uncertainty estimation/continual learning problems
- prior work that the paper builds on is clearly referenced
- the possibility of incorporating new data without re-training is potentially practically impactful

### Weaknesses
- Largely due to the breadth of material covered, I find that the paper somewhat lacks depth and details in the main text. I appreciate that the authors don’t attempt to break their work into the smallest publishable units, but with the conference format being what it is, in my opinion there is also a case to be made for splitting work e.g. into a generic uncertainty estimation method and then extending it to continual learning in a separate paper in order to leave enough space for covering enough details on the method/design choices (Q1&2) and discussing the relationship with prior approaches (Q3-5).
- The title seems to place the emphasis on the continual learning part of the paper, however the empirical evaluation here is extremely small scale (nothing beyond MNIST-scale). I would find it difficult to argue for the method on a quantitative basis and would find e.g. Split CIFAR results helpful.
- Similarly the in-distribution uncertainty evaluation is a bit limited. I appreciate that these experiments were run as sanity checks, but to me it would be sufficient to leave them in the appendix (or run the full suite of uncertainty evaluation experiments on OOD/shifted data to make a more convincing quantitative case for the method).
- The evaluation of the dual parameter updates is mostly an afterthought, Table 4 seems to only show that it is possible in principle. I think this is a real shame, I’m not aware of any other near-zero cost approach for incorporating new data. I wish this was a much bigger focus in the empirical evaluation and there was more of an attempt to push the limits here, e.g. by using smaller and smaller initial datasets for learning the NN parameters, longer streams of data or two distinct datasets, e.g. MNIST/FashionMNIST or CIFAR10/SVHN where the learned parameters may be less relevant for the second datasets (essentially I would like to see the boundaries being pushed and get a sense of where the dual parameter updates start to fail).
- The continual objective seems to scale linearly in the number of tasks (both in terms of memory and computational complexity), in contrast to weight space methods that tend to add a constant overhead.

### Questions
1. How are the inducing points chosen? This isn’t discussed in the main text, they are simply assumed to exist around Eqs 12 & 13. The pseudocode in the appendix seems to suggest they are sampled from the real data?
2. Similarly, the continual objective in Eq 14 appears out of nowhere. I appreciate that there is a derivation in the appendix, but there is no reference to this in the main text. Does the objective correspond to some principled approximation to the posterior as in e.g. VCL or online Laplace (although these of course accumulate approximation errors)? Or is it some ad-hoc expression to maintain close predictions on old data with previous parameters?
3. The paper states at the end of the related work section “In contrast to the method presented in this paper, these functional regularization methods lack a principled way to incorporate information from all data. Instead, they rely on subset approximations”, but this seems to be the case for the present paper as well (assuming I'm not mistaken in Q1)? I understand that the dual parameters ultimately are determined as a sum over all data, yet the projection onto the inducing points does seem like a subset approximation to me, in particular since the regularization term is a sum over the inducing points, i.e. a subset.
4. Would optimizing the inducing points render the method equivalent to (Ortega et al., 2023)? If so, that seems like a highly relevant baseline/ablation.
5. The objective in Eq 14 seems quite closely related to that formulated in (Rudner et al., 2022) — which is admittedly rather generic. Would your approach fit in as a variational method or is it lacking the penalty terms related to the precision matrix?

Minor:
- I think there is a mixup in the bibtex entry for the VCL citation, this should presumably be (Nguyen et al., Variational Continual learning, ICLR 2018)
- Table 1: MAP seems to perform by far the best on half the datasets, do you have any comments on this? It might also be worth adding a HMC baseline (at least if you think of your method as a BNN method, I don’t think this is stated anywhere explicitly).
- Table 2: accuracy values are decimals rather than percent as indicated in the header
- Table 2: including the Laplace results without tuning the prior precision seems fairly pointless, it is well known across the literature that sampling from the Laplace approximation in weight space does not work well without cross-validation or online tuning. Why not use the latter if rejecting the former due to breaking the MAP property of the parameters?
- NLPD should be defined
- Laplace Kron should be referenced/cited in the experiments
- "Hessian is often infeasible and in practice it is common to adopt the GGN approximation" This seems like a slightly inaccurate statement, infeasible is calculating the full matrix, the GGN approximation is to ensure positive definiteness
- Why the two separate for loops in Algorithm 1? It seems like the SLICE variables just add notational clutter and the updates to the sum could be done in a single loop?
- The appendix mentions using double precision for the post-training computations, is that a precautionary choice or do e.g. the matrix inversions fail in single precision?

### Summary
The paper presents a new method to turn a pre-trained NN, trained with the MAP objective, into a GP model with a kernel based on the Neural tangent kernel. They then show its usefulness on many different tasks.

### Strengths
- The method, to the best of my knowledge is novel.
- The experiments cover a diverse set of problems

### Weaknesses
- My main issue with this paper is that it does not explain or derive any of its equations, not even in the supplementary. It is not clear how the authors arrived at eq. 7,8,10 & 11. It isn't even clear what the authors mean by dual parameterization (dual in what sense?) as it was never explained. While basic things like Laplace approximation and sparse GP are explained, the main points of this paper aren't.
- I am unclear about the issue with adding points to the standard GP. Once you have your kernel, given to you by the MAP trained NN, you can use it on any number of points you want. You can also train a standard sparse-GP approximation using the fixed kernel. The authors claim that this is an issue that their work solves, but I don't see any reason why it should be so and they do not explain it properly.
- Baselines in many of the experiments are very basic. For instance, in Table 1 you compare to Laplace approximation and using a simple subset selection sparse GP. Other Bayesian NN methods should be compared against, for example NN-GP, deep kernel learning, SWAG.
- I would also point out another relevent work on incremental learning by GPs Achituv et al "GP-Tree: A Gaussian process classifier for few-shot incremental learning"

### Summary
This paper introduces a new method for approximating a weight-space neural network using a function-space Gaussian process. To overcome the inhibitive computational complexity it then uses two techniques: a dual parameterization using a Laplacian approximation (equation 10) and sparsification (equations 12 and 13). The resulting sparse GP doesn't require any further training, but makes it easy to incorporate new data, which makes it suitable for continual learning. The paper proceeds with a series of experiments which show that the proposed model is effective at sparsifying (figure 3 and table 2), uncertainty quantification (table 1), continual learning (table 3), and incorporating new data (table 4).

### Strengths
I must preface this review by saying that this paper is not in my field of expertise. However, as someone who is unfamiliar with the topic, I found this paper well written and clear. The authors do a good job reviewing the set of results from the literature that they build on, before presenting their own model. They argue convincingly show that their model has practical advantages (i.e., for incorporating new data and continual learning), and the experiments seem to support the theory.

### Weaknesses
Perhaps the text would benefit from some pseudo-code or explanations that relate the theory to the actual practical algorithm, particularly for a reader like myself who is unfamiliar with the related literature.

I am also not too familiar with the continual learning or reinforcement learning literature, so I find it difficult to judge whether table 3 and figure 4 present a competitive set of baselines, but the results seem compelling.

Minor:

* "adpot" should be "adopt" in section 3
* "subest" shoudl be "subset" in "Sparsification via dual parameters"

### Questions
These might be obvious to someone more familiar with the literature, but questions that I was left with were:

* The final model (equation 12) seems to rely on inversing $\\bf{K_{zz}}$. How are the inducing points to form this matrix chosen?
* In the paragraph "GPs" it says that $\\bf{\Lambda}$ can be considered per-input noise. How so?
