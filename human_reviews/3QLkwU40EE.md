- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled ‘seen’ class images. A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/sptnet.

### Summary
- Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is the problem of leveraging information from known classes in labeled data to automatically identify known and unknown classes in unlabeled data. Authors propose a two stage aporoach, named SPTNet for GCD. 
- SPTNet iteratively optimizes "model" parameters of large self-supervised networks and "data" parameters (i.e. prompt tuning methods). The former adapts the model to the data while the latter adapts the data to improve the model's capability of identifying categories. 
- Authors propose a novel Spatial Prompt Tuning (SPT) method that enables the model to focus on object parts an show remarkable improvements across several GCD benchmarks with very few additional trainable parameters.

### Strengths
- The idea of optimizing the model and data parameters to improve GCD has some merit especially for discovery in fine-grained datasets. 
- The experiments section supports most of the claims (except a few discussed in weaknesses) made in the paper and show the merit of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
**Interpretability of SPT**:
- Authors claim that SPT enables the model to focus on parts of objects, but the way it is designed, there are learnable parameters around each patch. Are the learned parameters, after convergence, sparse in nature? Are there more non-zero values around discriminative regions of objects and zero around patches belonging to background? The SPT setup in its current form is not very interpretable and the experiments certainly do not validate the claim that SPT is better than Bahng et al. because it enables the model to focus on object parts. 
Can this claim be validated/negated if, instead of around a patch, SPT is applied as learnable horizontal or vertical stripes in the image (maintaining the same number of parameters as the original SPTNet). If these experiments achieve the same performance, then the claim made by the authors is not true. I would like to hear the authors' thoughts on this.
**Ablation experiments**:
- Table-4 is not presented efficiently in my opinion and needs more attention. From rows 6 and 7, without Global prompting, SPT-S is better than SPT-P. But there is no experiment which uses Global + SPT-S with alternate training in the table. 
- I recommend adding one component at a time to the baseline, makes the table more readable than its current form. I believe most of the experiments are in there and all one would need is to rearrange the rows accordingly. 
- Also the accompanying text to Table-4 has some mistakes which make it harder to read the table. For example. Rows 5,6 compare the effect of alternate training. But in the text, authors explain that these two rows show the benefit of global prompting. Kindly make the table and text consistent and readable to improve reading experience.
**Alternate training**: 
- In Fig. 3(a), for each k, are epochs adjusted accordingly? I believe this is important because authors report that with smaller k, the model underfits. But what about the experiment of training the model parameters to convergence, followed by training the SPT to convergence (k=1). This experiment is crucial to understand why the alternate training is required. Please provide the details of this experiment. 
**Qualitative results**:
Authors show attention maps in Fig. 4b and claim that with SPT, the heads cover the object. I do not see a difference between visualizations of SimGCD and SPTNet to be honest. Instead of showing 4 examples with all the heads, I recommend authors to be more specific and show exactly (by highlighting the region) what they want the readers to focus on. In its current form Fig. 4 does not add anything new to the discussion and can be removed entirely to make space for more important experiments (suggested above).

### Questions
**Suggestions**:
- The writing of the paper can be improved. Few sections (ablation, Section 3.2) need improvement. 
- Font of text in Fig.1 font is too small and I recommend increasing that. 
- Difference between SPTNet and SPTNet-P is not clear in the main paper. Readers have to look to supplementary to get clarity. Since this is an important part of the contribution, its better authors move Fig. 5 to the main paper. Also provide an example of computing total number of parameters of SPT in the supplementary. 

**Questions**:
- What happens when you train Bahng et. al's Global prompts by increasing the number of parameters to match SPT? I understand its not a whole lot of parameters but how much would that change the performance of using Global prompts?
- In the paragraph below **Stage 2: Fix p_{1:n}...**, authors present that they use the spatial prompts as augmentations. But by using learned prompts as augmentation, you are asking the network to be invariant to it, how does this help? The intuition behind using this and why would it improve the performance? How much does it improve the performance of contrastive loss? If that is a significant improvement, then that would be a good result for self-supervised literature.

**Please address all the concerns and questions raised above for me to improve my ratings**

### Summary
The paper addresses the Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) problem, which involves training on labeled images from seen classes to classify both seen and unseen class images. The authors propose an alternative training method for prompts and model parameters, specifically introducing a spatial prompt tuning method that adds image prompts on a patch-wise basis. Their approach achieves a significant performance improvement of about 10% over existing methods using fewer parameters.

### Strengths
- The method proposed is both simple and highly effective, appearing easy to implement.

- Overall, except for the lack of method reasoning, the text is readable and has high-quality writing.

- Comprehensive evaluations across various datasets and against state-of-the-art methods are conducted, with thorough ablation studies and analyses supporting the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The paper's main weakness lies in the lack of a detailed explanation of why the proposed method significantly improves GCD performance. While the alternative training of model and prompt, which enables more fine-grained augmentation, is acknowledged, the paper does not thoroughly describe how this relates to the GCD problem and why it leads to better performance. 

- The reasoning behind why SPTNet outperforms Global Prompt in GCD is supported only by experimental results and not by direct consideration of object parts, with insufficient evidence contrary to Vaze et al. (2022)'s findings. 

- The paper needs analysis of how alternative training induces changes and what benefits it has over end-to-end or completely separate two-stage learning strategies in terms of Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning aspects.

### Questions
The paper could strengthen its reasoning and analysis linking the simple strategy proposed to the task of GCD. While it demonstrates a substantial performance increase with a straightforward approach, there is a lack of analysis or reasoning provided in the paper, making it difficult to directly correlate the performance improvements with their causes.

### Summary
This paper approaches Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) from an alternate perspective, which optimizes data and model parameters by prompt learning and finetuning, respectively. To this end, they propose a visual prompt learning method that learns data representation to better focus on object parts for generalizability. They achieve further performance improvement compared with the previous arts and investigate their approach with sufficient experimental analyses.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-organized to present their approach. They first tackle the previous GCD methods and redefine the problem with their own perspective. Then, they show their proposed methods based on their objective. It is easy to follow their objective that they propose spatial prompt tuning for better generalization on both seen and unseen classes.
- The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SPNet in their framework with sufficient experimental analysis. Their in-depth analysis shows that their proposed method clearly contributes to performance improvement.

### Weaknesses
- Although the authors explain the necessity of an alternative training strategy by referring to the EM algorithm, this reviewer did not reach the reasoning behind this explanation. This reviewer can agree that the authors demonstrate this training strategy empirically. It does not seem to be a specialized method for GCD. This reviewer recommends explaining in more detailed reasoning to choose this strategy if the authors have more reasons than the only empirical observation.
- Even though the authors investigate the alternative training strategy by ablation study, this reviewer suggests presenting the visualization of representation during training at each switch to show the representation is enhanced as the objective of their approach.
- As far as this reviewer’s understanding, their framework can be utilized for zero-shot learning tasks such as open-set recognition and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which evaluate the model on both seen and unseen classes, not only GCD. This reviewer agrees that their results show efficiency and efficacy. This reviewer believes that the experiment results on the closely related task strengthen their study.
