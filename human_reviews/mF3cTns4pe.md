## Abstract
Daily internet communication relies heavily on tree-structured graphs, embodied by popular data formats such as XML and JSON. However, many recent generative (probabilistic) models utilize neural networks to learn a probability distribution over undirected cyclic graphs. This assumption of a generic graph structure brings various computational challenges, and, more importantly, the presence of non-linearities in neural networks does not permit tractable probabilistic inference. We address these problems by proposing sum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from unstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. To this end, we use random finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph and to allow for exact and efficient inference. We demonstrate that our tractable model performs comparably to various intractable models based on neural networks.

### Summary
This paper proposes sum-product-set networks (SPSN), a tractable probabilistic model for tree-structured data. Interestingly, the structure of the tree and dimensionality of the data is assumed to be random rather than fixed. This is achieved through the use of random feature sets (RFS), which allows for the specification of distributions over sets of varying length taking value in some domain. RFS are integrated with Sum-Product Networks (SPN) through the use of a schema/template for the data, which hierarchically specifies the fixed parts of the tree structure (heterogenous nodes) and the variable parts (homogenous nodes). Under some (strong) assumptions on the set unit distributions and the query, inference is shown to be tractable in SPSNs. Empirical results show that the classification performance is slightly worse than, but competitive with, approaches based on neural networks.

### Strengths
The paper presents an (as far as I am aware) novel problem of developing a tractable probabilistic model for tree-structured data, where the graph of the tree is itself random. Such data structures naturally arise in many areas, such as XML/JSON, scientific domains, natural language (e.g. syntax trees), and relational data. The proposed solution, SPSNs, are a well-designed variant of sum-product networks that utilizes random features sets (set units) to allow tree nodes to have a random number of children while maintaining tractability.

- Novel and adept application of RFS theory to deep tractable model architectures (SPNs). This enables the specification of distributions over hierarchical random trees.
- The work could have significant impact in pushing the application of TPMs towards new domains, such as natural language processing. 
- The clarity and technical quality of the paper is excellent. In particular, Figure 2 was very useful for understanding the role of sum, product and set units in relation to the tree schema.

### Weaknesses
- The requirement of full independence in the distribution of a set unit seems quite stringent and potentially unrealistic. For example, for the mutagenesis example in Figure 1, this would correspond to atoms in a molecule being independent (conditional on the molecule size). 
- On the empirical side, to justify the importance of tractability it would be useful to test some example queries on the learned SPSNs, and their domain-specific interpretation.

### Questions
- Is it possible to relax the assumption of full independence in a set unit, or is this a fundamental limitation? E.g. through partial exchangability for the set unit distributions?
- Details on how SPSNs are learned seem to be missing. It seems the structure of the SPSN is fixed (Pg 4.), but how are the parameters learned? Is the cardinality distribution learned, and if so, how is it parameterized?
- Is there any technical reason why the SPSN architecture cannot be extended to DAG, rather than tree structured data? 
- The related work section is thorough, but, especially considering that the tested datasets all come from a relational schema, it would be useful to better understand the relationship with relational SPNs. For example, how does one translate a relational schema to a tree schema as in Figures 4-11 (in what way is relational data "a particular form of graph-structured data")?
- It is not clear what the result is in Proposition 2 (the statement seems more like a definition).

============================
*After rebuttal/discussion*

After the author rebuttal and reviewer/AC discussion, I have mixed feelings about the work. I find the approach of SPSNs for probabilistically modelling tree structured data using RFS to be very promising, with some evidence for its utility through experiments. On the other hand, the manuscript does not fully justify/analyse key components of the approach, namely (1) providing concrete examples of interesting tractable inference queries when the number of variables is not fixed, besides marginalizing leaves (where the structure of the tree is already fixed); and (2) empirical or theoretical analysis of the impact of Assumption 1 on expressivity/modelling capacity. I still support acceptance but less enthusiastically given the mentioned weaknesses.

### Summary
The authors propose sum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from unstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. Key to their approach is the use of random finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph and allow for exact and efficient inference. The empirically demonstrate that their approach is on par with other intractable neural models.

### Strengths
- The paper is decently written, although, in my opinion, some important aspects seem to be missing.

- Despite the potentially toyish nature of the experiments considered, the proposed models seem to be on par with other intractable neural models, as well as significantly more robust to missing data.

### Weaknesses
- The writing of the paper would be greatly improved by adding informal intuitions here and there, as well as a (toy) complete example of an SPSN.

- The authors do not make it clear that one could not obtain a distribution over tree-structured graphs using e.g. knowledge compilation to compile the distribution over tree-structured graphs into a logical circuit whose parameters could then be learnt, inducing a distribution over the desired structured objects. If so, is one theoretical conclusion that there is an expressivity gap between PCs with and without set units?

- The authors only remark in passing that the infinite sum required to evaluate the set unit reduces to a finite one in practice; an argument upon which their tractability results hold. This should be made more formal.

- The writing doesn't really give us an idea of the scale of the experiments performed, but they seem toyish.

### Questions
- The first question that comes to mind is: can we not use knowledge compilation [1] to compile the distribution over tree-structured graphs into a logical circuit? One can use logical circuits to induce distributions over many different structured objects such as paths in a grid, hierarchies of classes, preferences, as well as subsets of size $k$ [2, 3, 4]. One can then learn the parameters of such a distribution from the data. It might very well be the case that the distribution over tree-structured graphs does not admit a tractable circuit, but such an assertion seems to be absent from the paper.

- Could you please explain what a schema is? I understand how one could obtain a schema from a tree-structured graph, but aside from the definition, I was hoping for an intuitive explanation. ( I am familiar with the term in the context of databases, which does not seem to translate? )

- Am I correct in my understanding that, according section, set units only apply to homogeneous nodes?

- I really would've like to see a (toy) complete example of an SPSN. Could you please provide such an example?

- Assumption 1 (Requirements on the set unit) "states that the cardinality distribution vanishes for a sufficiently large $m$", What exactly do you mean by that? As a follow up, am I correct in understanding that the elements of the set are independent given the cardinality? i.e. we do not consider the statistical correlations between the elements of a set? ~To me this consequently puts into questions the tractability of SPSNs laid out in proposition 1.~

- Could you please say more regarding Definition 5? What structural constraint is being imposed here exactly? To me, "follow only a single child of each sum unit" reads as determinism?

### Summary
The paper suggests a new type of probabilistic circuit (PC) that can be trained and perform inference in tree-structured graph data. Standard sum-product networks (SPNs), a PC, represent a probability density over unstructured data, which forms the input random variables. To model a density over tree-structure graphs, the manuscript introduces "set units," nodes in the PC that allow for a variable number of nodes/edges in the data graph.

### Strengths
* Tractability and Exchangeability: The manuscript presents a theoretical foundation for the tractability of the method, based on PC results in Section 3.1 and SPSNs' exchangeability based on its node types in Section 3.2.
* Using the theory of finite random sets in SPSNs yields a simple and elegant way of representing tree-structured graphs.

### Weaknesses
* Implementation: the manuscript does not provide a transparent discussion about the implementation of SPSNs. The non-formal description provided in "Building SPNs" raises relevant questions related to the convergence and size of the model. Moreover, from the setup, it is unclear how sensitive parameter initialization and/or hyper-parameter tuning the model is.
* Experiments are encouraging but not convincing. Section 5 is unclear on how the tractability and exchangeability properties of SPSNs are exploited in the experiments. While the missing values results in Figure 3 are beneficial, they do not highlight "efficient inference over
specific parts of the data graph," as stated in the Conclusion. Moreover, it might be helpful to the manuscript to compare the results with recent works, such as the ones discussed in Section 4.
* Paper presentation
    - The writing is unclear between PCs and SPNs, as the title evokes SPNs while the text uses PCs. The authors should clarify the difference between the two or assume interchangeable usage under assumptions.
    - It could be beneficial to discuss the differences between SPNs and SPSn sooner in the paper, as it is a key contribution of the work. The sentence "This differs from the conventional sum-product network..." is helpful but only appears in Section 3.
    - The manuscript could better articulate its motivation by connecting the problems presented in the introduction with some of the results. For instance, it is not clear in the paper how SPSNs take advantage of "the parent-child ancestry inherent in tree-structured graphs" in a different way than competitive generative models.

### Questions
* Were there any empirical boundaries or assumptions when implementing the recursive algorithm described in "Building SPSNs"? How do you deal with large data graphs with multiple heterogeneous nodes and size constraints?
* Could you please expand on the "(...) building a set of trees based on a user-specified neighborhood" in Section 4 regarding the similar graph-based approach from (Errica & Niepert, 2023)?

**1** the problem this paper working on is important to the community. The way of extending the applicability of probabilistic circut to the tree-structured graph data would be interesting and promising to the community. 

**2** the presentation and writing are very well. Although I am new to this topic, I can easily understand the main points and the main mechanism of this SPSNs method. 

**3** I like the investigation of the exchangeability of SPSNs. The study seems complete.

### Weaknesses
