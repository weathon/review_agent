## Abstract
In model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), most algorithms rely on simulating trajectories from one-step dynamics models learned on data. A critical challenge of this approach is the compounding of one-step prediction errors as length of the trajectory grows. In this paper we tackle this issue by using a multi-timestep objective to train one-step models. Our objective is a weighted sum of a loss function (e.g., negative log-likelihood) at various future horizons. We explore and test a range of weights profiles. We find that exponentially decaying weights lead to models that significantly improve the long-horizon R2 score. This improvement is particularly noticeable when the models were evaluated on noisy data. Finally, using a soft actor-critic (SAC) agent in pure batch reinforcement learning (RL) and iterated batch RL scenarios, we found that our multi-timestep models outperform or match standard one-step models. This was especially evident in a noisy variant of the considered environment, highlighting the potential of our approach in real-world applications.

### Summary
The paper analyzes multistep prediction models for model-based reinforcement learning. 
Training models for multiple steps can yield better performance. However, as every timestep step prediction is required for planning,  different loss compositions for training single-step models with multistep losses are studied. 
The paper reports that an exponential weighting of loss terms, where longer time horizons have a lower weight, performs better, both in short as well as long-term predictions. The empirical evaluation is based on the cart-pendulum system.

### Strengths
- topic is important
- analysis and proposed loss weightings make sense
- analysis and methodology in principle good

### Weaknesses
- literally, no conclusion can be drawn from a single environment (with two levels of noise)
- the paper is empirical, so in order to make a robust statement the method needs to be evaluated on a large range of tasks
- the exponential weighting requires another hyperparameter that needs to be tuned to the horizon (and likely the task)
- presentation of results can be improved

### Questions
- Sec 4.2 + Fig 1: it is hard to believe that the model with h=10 makes no difference in the random case, but h=50 suddenly makes a big difference. 
    - The inset does not really help, as all lines coincide
- Sec 4.3 + Fig 2: I am confused. Here $h=2$ ($\alpha=0$)$ improves performance whereas in Fig 1 it did not?!
    - Also, I would suggest plotting these results with respect to h=1. So h=1 is a flat line at 0. It would be potentially easier to see differences. 
    - I think the long-term behavior (h>50) might not be so helpful, as such low $R^2$ values render the models useless anyway

- Sec 5.2: I would expect that when I need a model for h-step horizon planning, I would train it with an h-step loss (and then also only evaluate the prediction power up to h-steps. In the plots, there is mostly no visible difference after those steps. But how important is a difference in $R^2$ close to 1? Your Fig 5 suggests small differences can be actually quite important when planning. 
- Fig 4: for h=4 and h=10, the pink lines seems to be missing
- Also for the non-noisy case, the learned weighting seems very competitive, which is really interesting.

- Sec 5.3:
I see where little robust results here. for h=10 it seems to be mostly worse and with high variance.
Fig 5: Do I understand correctly that e.g. the red markers are all the same model trained with n=10 loss but used only for planning with h=1, 5, 10... ?

Comments: 
- I suggest in a future submission to run the same method on a variety of tasks going beyond just low-dimensional tasks and the DM-control suite. Following up on the learned alphas might be very fruitful and general. 
- testing the strength of the models with a short horizon model-based planning method might also be useful

### Summary
This papers studies how the accuracy of a model used for model-based reinforcement learning depends on the prediction horizon it has been to trained to predict at. It proposes different heuristics to weight the prediction horizons into a unified loss, and studies on CartPole how the prediction performance is related to the expected return collected by the resulting agent after RL training.

### Strengths
Despite the severe limitations of the paper, the following are positive points about its perspective on model-based reinforcement learning:
- The problem of finding better loss functions for training models of the dynamics, considering the final use that the reinforcement learning algorithm will make of these models, is important and relevant to the community
- I find the approach based on weighting different prediction horizons in a different way to be promising.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, I believe that the current iteration of the paper lacks a sufficient level of rigor for the contribution to be ready for publication:
- Despite the paper says this is a limitation, I believe the fact that the study is only conducted using a single, extremely simple, environment reduces the scope of the paper to be so small to be irrelevant. I encourage the authors to consider a larger suite of benchmarks, (e.g., MuJoCo, Brax, Myriad, MinAtar, Atari), picking the one that best suites their computational constraints.
- The results on the performance of RL algorithms are not particularly meaningful or significative (e.g., looking at Figure 4 and 5, the performance of all approaches seems to be the same): this might actually be related to the fact that more complex or even just diverse environments might be required to have a better understanding of how dynamics accuracy is related to expected return collected by an agent.
- Empirical comparison with similar approaches that are mentioned in the related work is missing. For instance, it is unclear why one should use a weighted loss instead of learning a different model for each time horizon.

### Questions
- What are the results in other environments?
- What are the results of comparison with other baselines?

### Summary
This paper tackles the compounding of model prediction errors
in model-based reinforcement learning for long prediction horizons.
They approach this by rolling out the prediction from a model
for multiple time-steps, computing the error for each time-step,
weighting the losses, and backpropagating the loss through the
full rollout trajectory. They tested several weighting strategies,
such as a uniform weighting, exponentially decaying weighting,
weighting to normalize the loss magnitudes.

The work performed experiments on the cartpole task in both a batch RL
setting (where they learn the model from data, then optimize the
policy from this model), and in an iterated RL setting, where the
policy is deployed in the environment to gather more data, iterating
multiple times to improve the performance.  In the batch RL setting,
the results were not statistically significant, while in the iterated
RL setting there was no improvement over a regular 1-step model.

### Strengths
- The use of the R2 score for evaluation of the prediction accuracy
was nice, as it provides an interpretable metric.
- The literature review and discussion were OK.

### Weaknesses
- The experimental results are not substantial. The method is only
demonstrated on cart-pole, and there is no statistically significant
improvement. I am not convinced the method works effectively.

- In some of the datasets, the data is generated from a fixed policy,
and the one-step model is used to predict the state at time step $t+h$,
by sequentially applying the actions $a_t, a_{t+1}, a_{t+2}$, etc. that
were applied in the rollout. In practice, the actions may also be
correlated with the state transitions, so making predictions in such
a feedforward manner may lead to inaccurate predictions. It may be
better to consider both the cases when applying the actions in a
feedforward manner, as well as the case when the actions are computed
from the policy based on the predicted states, as these may be different.
A simple exmaple to see the difference is when the environment is noisy,
and a feedback controller is applied in the system. The feedback controller
would control the system to eliminate the noise, and keep the system stable.
But if the model is rolled out in a feedforward manner, the applied
actions are unrelated to the noise, and the prediction may not be stable.

### Questions
Much more substantial experiments (in many more tasks) would be
necessary to change my opinion. This would be a large change to the
current manuscript, which I think would be too large and would require
a resubmission. Also, I am not confident that the method will provide
an improvement.

How do the computational costs for the different horizon training
methods compare?

### Summary
The paper proposes to use a multi-step loss to train a dynamics model. Instead of training on the standard 1-step loss, the paper proposes to use the n-step loss that recursively backpropagates through each model update. The learned dynamics model is then evaluated via batch (aka offline) and iterated reinforcement learning on the cartpole model.

### Strengths
The paper is nicely written and very easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The paper has two severe weaknesses, first the proposed approach has been evaluated multiple times and second the experimental evaluation is very limited. 

1) Multi-step Losses:
If I understand the proposed multistep loss correctly, this multistep loss has been proposed and utilized very often. For example, see the references [1-4] and there are many more. I am quite certain that one could even go back to the older system identification literature that talks about the multi-step loss for linear system identification. [4] even provides an ablation study across multiple horizons and systems. Interestingly, the results of [4] paint a different picture that going longer in the horizon is not necessarily better in terms of reward and quite frequently even worse (see Figure 3). The evaluation metrics as well as the RL algorithm are different in [4], [4] uses a CEM-like planner using the learned model instead of an actor-critic, but the discrepancy requires further investigation (see point 2).   

Could the authors please precisely elaborate on how their multi-step loss is different from the previous works, except for the different weighting approach? 

2) Experimental Evaluation:
The paper only evaluates using the cartpole swing-up task which is quite limited and does not include discrete contact events. Therefore, the paper would need to evaluate on much more and more complex dynamical system. Again [4] shows quite nicely that the results/conclusions from a cartpole do not transfer to a more complex system. [4] shows that for the cart pole, the longer horizon is always better in terms of prediction error and obtained reward, the conclusion cannot be generalized to more complex systems, where longer horizons start to perform worse. 

To make more claims about the multi-step loss the paper needs more evaluation of more complex systems that involve contacts.
