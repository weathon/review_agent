# SEAL: Simultaneous Label Hierarchy Exploration And Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Label hierarchy is an important source of external knowledge that can enhance classification performance. However, most existing methods rely on predefined label hierarchies that may not match the data distribution. To address this issue, we propose Simultaneous label hierarchy Exploration And Learning (SEAL), a new framework that explores the label hierarchy by augmenting the observed labels with latent labels that follow a prior hierarchical structure. Our approach uses a 1-Wasserstein metric over the tree metric space as an objective function, which enables us to simultaneously learn a data-driven label hierarchy and perform (semi-)supervised learning. We evaluate our method on several datasets and show that it achieves superior results in both supervised and semi-supervised scenarios.

### Summary
The authors propose to exploit a data-driven label hierarchical structure and perform semi-supervised learning simultaneously. Specifically, they introduce latent labels that are aligned with observed labels to capture the data-driven label hierarchy. And a Wasserstein-based regularization term is designed to encourage agreement on both observed and latent label alphabets. Experiments are conducted in both supervised and semi-supervised scenarios.

### Strengths
Exploring and incorporating the label hierarchy structure for semi-supervised learning is an intriguing area of investigation. Furthermore, I think the design of ‘SEAL extension’ is very subtle and interesting.

### Weaknesses
1.  While the former sections of the paper are exceptionally well-written, the later parts, particularly the approach section, pose challenges in terms of comprehension；
2.  It is challenging to grasp the underlying meaning of 'latent labels' in the explored hierarchical structure. For instance, 'red' and 'green' appear to be related to both 'apple' and 'paint,' even though the author provided Example 1；
3.  Following the previous question, it is important to note that in the current method, which is based on a hierarchical, the calibration of predictions at each level becomes crucial. However, the authors currently seem to neglect the calibration at latent levels;
4.  The theoretical analysis presented lacks valuable insights for the proposed approach. Furthermore, the author fails to clearly and concisely describe the integration of theory with their proposed approach, as mentioned in the Weaknesses 1;
5.  The datasets used in the paper are very small and trivial, and the comparative methods employed are not up to date with the SOTA. The experiments are not convincing enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Summary
This paper shows a new mehod that aims to learn the label hierarchy by augmenting the observed labels with latent labels that follow a prior hierarchical structure. Specifically, the authors expand the label alphabet by adding unobserved latent labels to the observed label alphabet.
The data-driven label hierarchy is modeled by combining the predefined hierarchical structure of latent labels with the optimizable assignment between observed and latent labels. In order to verify its rationality, the authors conduct a series of experiments on semi-supervised classification.

### Strengths
+ Hierarchical classification and learning class hierarchy via machine learning methods are interesting topics, and this paper bases on a good motivation.
+ This paper provides a good exploration for hierarchical semi-supervised classification tasks, and the experiments can support the idea of this paper to some extent.

### Weaknesses
+ In Section 3.2, the authors say that, according to Example 1, the latent variables can provide more information to the classifier and lead to better performance. This confuses me how the conditional probabilities of latent nodes benefit the learning of leaf nodes. In my view, Example 1 only show how to get the marginal probabilities of latent nodes from some given conditional distribution of leaf nodes through Bayes rule.

+ In Eq. (2), the dimension of A is $N$, so the dimension of the latent labels is $N-K$. Does this mean that we need to specify the number of categories of hidden labels in advance? How to set this hyper-parameter for different datasets, and do different values of this parameter affect the performance for one single dataset? Besides, how do we know the number of levels of label hierarchies? In other words, could the proposed method learn a multi-level class hierarchy? This is unclear in the manuscript.

+ In Theorem 2, is $\mathbf 1_N$ a N-dim vector whose elements are all 1? The authors should provide detailed notation for readers.

+ It’s hard to understand Definition 1 since there are so many unclear descriptions. For example, what’s the meaning of $\mu_s$ and $\mu_r$. As mentioned above, $\alpha_{sr}$ is a matrix, but in Eq. (3) it seems a scalar. Those unclear words make make it hard to follow this Section.

+ Is $w_s$ in Eq. (4) a hyper-parameter or a learnable parameters?

+ In Section 3.3, does the Task (a) says that one can pre-define $\mathbf A_1$ rather than learn it by the proposed method? If so, how to perform it? The sentence “we choose A1 to be a trivial binary tree or trees derived from prior knowledge such as a part of a knowledge graph or a decision tree.” is quite unclear.

+ The authors should compare the proposed method with other methods for learning label hierarchy in order to demonstrate its superiority.

### Summary
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an effective ML paradigm for learning high-quality classification models by leveraging unlabeled data, especially when annotated data is scarce. A vast number of approaches have been proposed for SSL based on augmentation,  regularization etc. This paper follows the key intuition of enforcing label-label correlations through learned label hierarchies as a an effective regularization strategy to improve SSL performance. 

While label hierarchies have been leveraged for SSL earlier, the key novelty of this paper appears to be that it learns a part of the hierarchy by exploiting unlabeled data, thus leading to task-aligned hierarchies. Specifically, the proposed approach learns soft edge weights between a set of latent variables (instantiated to concepts from pre-existing domain-informed hierarchies) and a set of observed variables (actual labels in an SSL). A mathematical framework around Wasserstein distance is proposed for this, although it appears to serve only as an interesting connection and not essential to the central premise of this paper. 

Experimental results show significant gains when labeled data is very sparse, mainly when the proposed SEAL regularizer is combined with other previously proposed, effective SSL techniques such as DebiasPL and FlexMatch.

### Strengths
* The central idea of simultaneously learning label correlations (via hierarchies) through unlabeled data and then using it to improve SSL performance appears to be novel and useful and deserves more exploration

* Experimental results show significant gains when labeled data is very sparse, mainly when the proposed SEAL regularizer is combined with other previously proposed, effective SSL techniques such as DebiasPL and FlexMatch

### Weaknesses
* Experiments do not compare with any competing SSL baselines that leverage label hierarchies. As the related work section notes, several hierarchical schemes have already been proposed, some of them specifically for SSL. But their relative performance w.r.t SEAL has not been compared or discussed. Note that the standalone gains due to SEAL alone are not impressive - only when combined with other orthogonal schemes does it work best. Finally, a good qualitative discussion of results is also lacking. Due to these reasons, the true utility of SEAL has not been demonstrated clearly.

* The set of baselines in Tables 2 and 3 are not the same and no explanation has been provided for this mismatch

* The optimization algorithm for minimizing the final SSL objective (that incorporates SEAL regularizer) has not been fleshed out in full detail



* Theoretical results are not critical. They are more about the sanity of choices made and less about the generalization ability of SEAL technique etc.

### Questions
* How does SEAL compare with the best of prior label hierarchy (and label correlation) exploiting approaches for SSL? Does (SEAL+Curriculum) outperform (best label hierarchy baseline for SSL+Curriculum)?

* Why are the set of baselines in Tables 2 and 3 not identical? Please provide full set of results.

* Give more details for (1) hierarchy that is assumed over latent variables, (2) optimization algorithm for minimizing eqn 16.

### Summary
The paper presents a method of constructing label hierarchy using the soft Tree-Wasserstein distance approach. The label hierarchy term is applied as a regularizer for supervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios, where the learning and tree parameters are optimized jointly. The method is compared with various semi-supervised learning baselines and demonstrates accuracy gains when combined with pseudo-labeling techniques.

### Strengths
Learning label hierarchy is an important problem especially in the semi-supervised scenarios, where some form of hidden structure is needed to leverage the unlabeled part of a dataset.
When combined with other methods for pseudo-labeling, the method demonstrates its value over several datasets in the semi-supervised setting. The paper is clear and easy to follow, it contains several important ablation studies which illustrate the algorithm behavior.

### Weaknesses
The originality of the method is limited. The methodological part of the label hierarchy construction is taken from (Takezawa et al., 2021), and applied as a regularization term to a supervised and a semi-supervised loss.

For the experimental part, it would be great to see the comparison on some other datasets like SVHN and ImageNet, since those are used in the FlexMatch paper, and comparing with FlexMatch is the most important.

For tables 1 and 2, it would be worth adding both SEAL (Debiased) and SEAL (Cirriculum) to both tables to see the full comparison of the proposed scenarios.

### Questions
One thing I wasn’t able to get from the experimental study – how do the results differ from different tree structures, depending on the depth and vertex degree of a tree? Some ablation study on that would help.
