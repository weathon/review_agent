- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
Minimax problems are notoriously challenging to optimize. However, we present that the two-timescale extragradient method can be a viable solution. By utilizing dynamical systems theory, we show that it converges to points that satisfy the second-order necessary condition of local minimax points, under mild conditions that the two-timescale gradient descent ascent fails to work. This work provably improves upon all previous results on finding local minimax points, by eliminating a crucial assumption that the Hessian with respect to the maximization variable is nondegenerate.

### Summary
The paper studies the local minimax points in minimax optimization when the objective is smooth and possibly nonconvex-nonconcave. They first examine the previous second-order necessary and sufficient conditions for minimax points and propose a new necessary condition that allows $\nabla^2_{yy} f$ to be degenerate. Using dynamical system tools, they further show that two-timescale extragradient converges to points satisfying this condition under mild assumptions and almost surely avoids strict non-minimax points, while two-timescale GDA may avoid some local minimax points that are degenerate.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a new second-order necessary condition for local minimax points, which allows the Hessian $\nabla^2_{yy} f$ to be degenerate. For some local minimax points with degenerate $\nabla^2_{yy} f$, it is shown that two-timescale extragradient will converge to them while two-timescale GDA may avoid them. This provides a better understanding of the behaviors of classical first-order algorithms for minimax optimization. I believe this contribution is interesting enough to the community.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the proposed restricted Schur complement $S_{res}$ allows the Hessian $\nabla^2_{yy} f$ to be degenerate, the obtained necessary condition still requires some other assumptions on $h(\delta)$, and characterizing the limit points of extragradient through $S_{res}$ also requires other conditions like $s_0$, $\eta^*$, $\sigma_j$ or $\iota_j$. These conditions, including $S_{res}$, could be computationally more heavy and cumbersome to check. Some high-level intuition about how $S_{res}$ is designed and why it is helpful could be good as well.

2. What does the assumption that $S_{res}$ is nondegenerate imply? What assumptions on $H$ are necessary to make sure $S_{res}$ is nondegenerate?

3. I think it would help improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly saying continuous-time GDA/EG or discrete-time GDA/EG to distinguish them. In Example 2, the paper uses both Definition 2(i) and 3 when justifying the behaviors of $xy$. However, 2(i) is for continuous time and 3 is for discrete time. Actually, $\rho\\{\pm i\sqrt{\epsilon}\\}\leq 1$ implies linearly stability if applying Definition 3. Similar confusions between continuous time and discrete time exist elsewhere as well.

4. It would improve the clarity of the paper if some notations were introduced before using them, although the meaning is well-known and can be guessed from the context.  For example, $C^2$ and $DF$ in Assumption 1, $\lambda_j$ in Lemma 5.1, etc.

### Summary
This paper focuses on nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization when the Hessian $\nabla_{yy}^2 f$ is possibly degenerate. The authors introduce the concept of restricted Schur complement to refine the second-order condition and provide a characterization of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the saddle gradient in an asymptotic sense. In particular, the degeneracy leads to pairs of nearly imaginary eigenvalues. To describe these eigenvalues, the authors investigate the curvature information through the *hemicurvature*. Based on this, it is established that the limit points of two-timescale EG in continuous time are local minimax points under mild conditions. Moreover, two-time-scale GDA may avoid non-strict minimax points, while two-timescale EG could find them, which demonstrates the superiority of two-timescale EG over two-timescale GDA.

### Strengths
The methods and conclusions in this article are valuable in terms of both originality and significance.

1. In terms of originality, the authors propose a new concept, the restricted Schur complement, to refine the second-order conditions. To study the stability, the authors introduce the concept of the *hemicurvature* to characterize the eigenvalues. These concepts and tools seem novel and fascinating.

2. Regarding significance, this paper improves upon previous results by eliminating the nondegenerate condition on the Hessian $\nabla_{yy} f$ and provides solid evidence to demonstrate the superiority of two-timescale EG over two-timescale GDA. I believe the methodology and conclusions in this paper are helpful for future research in degenerate cases. 

3. I have checked some parts of the appendices and think the derivation is rigorous.

### Weaknesses
This is room for improvement in the presentation.

1. The organization is less satisfactory and some results lack intuitive interpretation in the main text. I provide several examples below.
 
* (i) The concept of hemicurvature is a bit opaque and the result of Proposition 6.7 is not intuitive. However, the figures in the appendix are a good illustration and could be put in the main text. 
* (ii) The authors mention that they adopt the hemicurvature instead of the curvature because of the property in Proposition C.4. From the proof, this property is indeed important and the authors should elaborate on this in the main text. 
* (iii) Theorem 6.4 is based on two additional conditions: the distinction of $\sigma_i$ and $u_j^\top S u_j \ge 0 $. The authors should give more explanations on these conditions, e.g., why we need these conditions or what their role is. 
* (iv) In Theorems 6.2 and 6.6, there appear $s^*$ and $\eta^*$. It is worth discussing their values. For example, what is the relationship between them and $s_0$?

In summary, I advise the authors to compress the review of previous results and add more interpretation in Sections 5 and 6. The methods and conclusions are valuable and deserve more elaboration. Moreover, the abstract is a bit uninformative and should also be extended.

2. To demonstrate the superiority of two-timescale EG over two-timescale GDA, the authors could provide the results of GDA corresponding to Propositions 6.1 and 6.5, and then plot these regions in the complex plane as a better illustration. 

Minor concerns:
In the second instance in Example 1, the local minimax points should be $(0,0,t,0,t)$.

### Questions
1. In Example 1, the restricted Schur complement for the two cases is zero or degenerate. Could the authors provide an example such that the restricted Schur complement is non-zero and non-singular?

2. If Assumption 2 is removed, do some results in Theorem 5.3 still hold?

### Summary
The paper studies the local properties of the extragradient method with timescale separation between the minimizing and maximizing player. They crucially drop the previous requirement of nondegenerate $\nabla^2_{yy} f$, by instead considered conditions on what they call the _restricted_ shur complement of the Jacobian of the saddle gradient. They show convergence to local minimax points for the discrete two timescale extragradient method and a second order continuous approximation. They further show avoidance of strict non-minimax points almost surely.

### Strengths
The paper addresses the important problem of local behaviour of two-timescale extragradient in nonmonotone problems, it is technically strong and well-written.

### Weaknesses
I only have the following remark:

It seems that Thm. 6.2-6.4, Thm 6.6 and Thm. F.3 all treats _strict_ linearly stable points. The main claim that two-timescale extragradient finds (nonstrict degenerate) local minimax points (e.g. example 3) is found in Remark 6.8. The argument relies on showing avoidance of non local minimax point coupled with a _global_ convergence guarantee to a fixed point. 

The remark makes it appear as if global convergence for general nonconvex-nonconcave is solved, while Diakonikolas et al., 2021 only applies to the structured problems satisfying the weak Minty variational inequality. Furthermore, the proof provided in the appendix only applies to the Minty variational inequality (MVI).

I suggest toning down the claim and instead state that "_when_ global convergence can be guaranteed (as e.g. under MVI), Thm. 6.7 implies convergence to (degenerate) local minimax points".

Apart from this one case, the paper is otherwise very transparent about the claim that it makes.

Minor suggestions:

- Some definitions are hard to find (e.g. $H_\tau$ on page 5). I suggest moving definitions that are needed for the theorem statements to a central place to the extend that it is possible.
- It is probably worth mentioning [Bauschke et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09827.pdf) work on linear operators regarding the relationship to comonotonicity. 
- It is maybe worth contrasting the timescale separation between players with timescale separation ala [Hsieh et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10162.pdf) (also used for weak MVI).

### Questions
- Thm. 4.4 of [Zhang et al. 2022](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume23/20-918/20-918.pdf) seem to consider similar conditions on the restricted Shur complement. How does your results compare?
- How does the choice of $\tau$ propagate to e.g. Thm 6.2 or Thm 6.6? You make the final claims in terms of infinite time separation ($\infty$-EG). Can you claim anything about finite time separation?

### Summary
This paper delves into the realm of minimax optimization, offering a comparative analysis of the two-time scale extra gradient against the two-time scale gradient descent ascent. The authors demonstrate that while the two-time scale GDA successfully converges to a specific minimax point, it encounters difficulties in the presence of a degenerate Hessian. Viewing the problem through the lens of a continuous dynamical system, the two-time scale extra gradient emerges as the superior method. It converges to the minimax point, maintaining its effectiveness even when faced with a degenerate Hessian.

### Strengths
- This paper is the first to remove the non degenerate assumption in literature. It defines nature new notions of restricted Schur complement and strict non-minimax point in correspondence with their assumption.

- The paper adopts the high order ODE of EG, to resolve the issue of avoiding nonminimax points. This approach utilizes continuous dynamics techniques, which are then adeptly extended to the analysis of discrete dynamics.

### Weaknesses
- The authors could enhance their presentation by including additional examples or illustrative figures that emphasize the significance of the non-degenerate assumption and its impact on the algorithm's practical applicability. i.e. are there any examples that two-time scale GDA fails while two-time scale EG works?

- The absence of the conclusion and discussion sections from the main text disrupts the flow and detracts from the overall reading experience.

### Questions
- The timescale separation technique is proposed in Jin et al. (2020) to solve the convergence of GDA, is it still necessary in the analysis of EG? How will your analysis change if using a single-timescale EG? Is it possible to still obtain similar results?

- Is it possible to extend some of the analysis to the stochastic EG setting?
