# 3D Autoencoding Diffusion Model for Molecule Interpolation and Manipulation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Manipulating known molecules and interpolating between them is useful for many applications in drug design and protein engineering, where exploration around the molecular templates is involved. Recent studies using equivariant diffusion models have made significant progress in the de novo generation of high-quality molecules, but using these models to directly manipulate a specified template remains less explored. This is mainly due to an intrinsic property of diffusion models: the lack of a latent semantic space that is easy to operate on. To address this issue, we propose the first semantics-guided equivariant diffusion model that leverages the “semantic” embedding of a 3D molecule, learned from an auxiliary encoder, to control the generative denoising process. By modifying the embedding, we can steer the generation towards another specified molecule or a desired molecular property. We show that our model can effectively manipulate basic chemical properties, outperforming several baselines. We further verify that our approach can achieve smoother interpolation between 3D molecular pairs compared to standard diffusion models.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of manipulating known molecules and interpolating between known molecules with deep generative models, especially diffusion models. Specifically, this paper focuses on the two tasks by the recently proposed equivariant diffusion generative models (requires equivariance since molecules are represented by 3D point clouds). The authors propose an auxiliary variable to improve the steerability and interpretability of the diffusion model. Experiments are conducted on both interpolation and optimization problems in the absence or the presence of a "template" molecule.

### Strengths
* This paper studies an important problem, how to interpolate between molecules and optimize molecules is a crucial problem in molecular discovery which has wide applications such as molecule optimization. The study of semantic directions in diffusion models is also timely and encouraged as it is the best-performing model in terms of generation quality at the moment.
* The idea of the method is quite simple but reasonable to introduce an auxiliary variable that learns control factors of the generative process.
* The proposed metrics seem to be reasonable for this relatively new task.

### Weaknesses
* The first major weakness of this paper is that it seems to ignore relevant literature in this area. Interpolation has been used and demonstrated for a long time [1, 2], the latent traversal has also been discovered before [3]. Despite this paper strikes the point that it focuses on diffusion models, but the authors should still consider proper comparisons or acknowledgments.

* Given this problem has been studied before, especially interpolation, the technical contribution of this paper is very limited. Another major contribution claimed in the paper (learning a semantics-guided autoencoding diffusion model) has also been proposed in [4]. The formulation looks exactly the same.

* It is not surprising that linear interpolation could lead to improved properties as studied widely in images and some in molecules (e.g. [3]), but the experimental details need to be included for a fair comparison and evaluation.

* The template-based manipulation seems an interesting setup, but a more realistic one should be specifying a specific molecule and then manipulate that molecule, given the stochastic forward process of diffusion model, maybe it is not possible. The name of "template-based" manipulation seems referring to manipulate any given molecule rather than a randomly sampled molecule.

* [Minor] The explanation of stability and validity seems to be different from the literature, see e.g. [5].

### Summary
The authors couple an autoencoder with a generative diffusion-based model for 3D molecule generation to overcome the potential limitation of not being able to operate on latent embeddings when using diffusion models. A semantic latent is trained as a condition for guiding the diffusion model to manipulate / interpolate molecules in 3D space. The authors present three different scenarios to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. One of the scenarios measures the ability to manipulate the latent embedding towards a target property using a linear regression model, which could be used, e.g., for the rational design of molecules.

### Strengths
- Although many works have been proposed in recent years leveraging the latent embeddings of AE/VAE architectures for interpolation and optimization tasks, the combination of a diffusion model with an autoencoder provides some novelty.

### Weaknesses
- Tables and figures are insufficiently described in the captions. 
- The paper only presents validity and stability metrics, but no similarity measures to examine the effectiveness of the template-guidance. Beyond that, the quality of the 3d geometries are not evaluated (e.g. energies and atomic forces).
- egDiffAE does not perform well in terms of stability (e.g. QM9 template-based generation 85.8% vs de-novo methods like EDM  90.7% [Hoogeboom et al] / Midi 97.5 [Vignac et al 23]). GEOM mol stability metrics are not given (only atom stability).
- The property manipulation does not seem to meaningfully alter the template, but mostly move atoms around and break/form some bonds. As a result, the results of property manipulation do not appear to be in equilibrium, but arbitrary conformations. Energies and atomic forces need to be carefully checked, since the optimized molecular properties are only meaningful in equilibrium. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the property models have been trained on equilibirum molecules, i.e. they might be out of their domain of applicability at arbitrary conformations.
- In Table 3, "retrieval" baseline yields similar results to egDiffAE, in some properties even performing better. For the the remaining properties, it is not possible to determine whether the improvement is significant and meaningful without error bars and units.

### Questions
- What is the practical relevance of molecule interpolation?
- How close are the generated / manipulated molecules to equilibrium?
- Why use MMD regularization instead of KL prior regularization as in VAE?
- How large is the batch size? MMD usually requires large batch sizes
- From the figures, it seems that interpolation and manipulation is only possible for molecules with same number of atoms?
- Why are there are no figures showing results on GEOM? This might be important to evaluate how the generation performs on larger molecules?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose an augmentation to the 3D equivariant diffusion model proposed by Hoogeboom et al, 22. This is done by including an extra “semantic embedding” (from an auxiliary encoder) at each step of the reverse diffusion process. The authors show that the “semantic embedding” improve some generation metrics  (although the choice of metrics are not the best, see below) and achieve good “property manipulation” performance. Experiments are done on three standard molecule datasets (QM9, GEOM-drugs and ZINC

### Strengths
- As mentioned in the paper, manipulate the latent space of diffusion models is not as easy as in other generative models. Understanding and improving on this issue is valuable for the research community.
- Moreover, the problem tackled on this work (ie, 3D molecule generation) is an important (and under-explored) application for machine learning.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is not very well written. Many definitions are wrongly used or used too loosely (eg, “de novo” or “template-based”) and a lot of implementation details are missing, making reproduction difficult.
- There are citations missing (many work do some kind of semantic guiding, eg Hoogeboom et al, 22, all the work on pocket-conditioning, linking, fragment-based generation, etc).
- The idea of conditional generation in some semantic space is interesting. However, the way it has been proposed seems ad-hoc to me. It is unclear what the “semantic encoding” is learning if the only loss is MMD with Gaussian.
- The metrics used on the experiments are not very convincing. The authors only use validity and atom stability—metrics that are known to be not very informative of the quality of the samples. I would recommend the authors to use the MiDi metrics (Vignac et al, 23) at a minimum. It is also not clear to me that the “smootheness” metric used is very informative. The results shown on Table 2 (mean +- std for both “smootheness mean” and “smootheness std” are not clear).
- The authors do not compute any measure of uniqueness/diversity of the generated molecules. It would be nice to see how diverse are the generated samples in this setting (since it is very important to generate diverse molecules in practice). I would imagine that the “semantic embedding” could highly reduce the diversity and this could be bad for some applications.

### Questions
- Please see the weaknesses above. It would be nice to hear the authors’ opinion about them.
- Many work propose some kind of inpainting for scaffold/linking (eg, DiffHopp (Torge et al 23), SBDDDiff (Schneuing et al 22), DiffLinker (Igashov et al 22), etc). It would be good to compare the performance of the model with some inpainting baseline. How does the proposed method differs from those approaches?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This submission proposes a method to control the generation process of 3D molecule diffusion models. This is to mitigate the research gap that most existing works focus on de novo molecule design, aka, generate random molecules, without controlling the molecule's properties. Specifically, they utilize an auxiliary encoder's output to condition the generation process of an equivariant diffusion model.  This allows the direct operation on the embeddings for effective interpolation and property manipulation of template molecules.

### Strengths
* The studied task of controlled molecule generation is of significant research and application value. Compared to de novo moleucle generation, controlled moelcule generation aligns better with the practical usage.

### Weaknesses
I am not very familar to diffusion models and the generation of 3D molecules. To me, the biggest concern is on the evaluation of the proposed method. It seems that there are no baselines that are directly comparable for the main experiments (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3), and the used evaluation metrics are sometimes insufficient to prove the value of the proposed method. For example:

* In Table 1, only `stableness` and `validity` are used as evaluation metric. However, for a template-based generation task, I expect metrics like `similarity to the template`, and `diversity of the generated molecules`. 
* In Table 2, the used evaluation metrics are somehow confusing. For `smoothness` and `midpoint similarity`, how are the similarity scores calculated? Do you use cosine similarity on embeddings? Or, do you apply other similarity metrics direclty on molecules?



I am willing to re-evaluate my rating based on other reviewers' comments.
