## Abstract
Discovering the underlying relationships among variables from temporal observations has been a longstanding challenge in numerous scientific disciplines, including biology, finance, and climate science. The dynamics of such systems are often best described using continuous-time stochastic processes. Unfortunately, most existing structure learning approaches assume that the underlying process evolves in discrete-time and/or observations occur at regular time intervals. These mismatched assumptions can often lead to incorrect learned structures and models. In this work, we introduce a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) with variational inference to infer a posterior distribution over possible structures. This continuous-time approach can naturally handle both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions for an SDE and SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable, and prove its consistency under infinite data limits. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved structure learning performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines under regular and irregular sampling intervals.

### Summary
The authors describe a type of latent variable model that can be identified from the high dimensional observations. Specifically, the authors describe a type of stochastic differential equation based model where the parameters of the drift and diffusion are given by some graph. The graph induces a particular type of interaction between the variables and one can then estimate some causal structures from this. The authors then provide a series of experiments demonstrating the applicability of their proposed method. They additionally theoretically analyze the structural identifiability in terms of the graph structure.

### Strengths
The topic is important and the authors consider an important class of stochastic processes to work on. The method empirically performs well in comparison to existing models.  The method is additionally well motivated with a few theoretical results on identifying the latent structure as well as the parameters of the diffusion. The interpretation of the drift and diffusion in terms of graphs provides an easier interpretation of the dependencies of the variables.

### Weaknesses
Aside from the graph interpretation if the drift/diffusion, the work is similar to a lot of existing works, so I wonder a bit how it is practically different from some of the others. For example, some of the theoretical results on latent identifiability are from the work Hasan et al but the authors do not consider that work as a baseline or mention it within the related work, though they estimate similar quantities.  Additionally the authors mention that this is a novel latent SDE formulation but most of the methodologies follow existing methods using a change of measure (e.g. Li et al among others). 

The numerical results were applied to fairly low dimensional datasets though it seems like the work could be applied to higher dimensional settings (as some of the related work applied to higher dimensional settings).

To summarize, I think I'm mainly confused as to what is different in this work compared to existing works since it's methodologically similar and the theoretical results are also similar. From what I've understood, it's mainly that the graph structure dictating the interaction is explicit.

### Questions
What is the main difference with other latent SDE models that have been proposed? Is it that the drift/diffusion are factorized in terms of the graph implying a particular architecture for those functions?

If one uses existing methods for uncovering SDEs (that use, for example, neural networks to represent functions) is there a way to estimate the graph structure from the learned function (e.g. by computing the partial derivatives between the function and the input)? How would the methods compare if the authors applied this technique to existing methods that estimate latent SDEs?

Do the authors have an idea of how the performance scales to higher dimensional observations?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper presents a structure learning method which aims to learn a graph fused into drift and diffusion function in stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The variational inference is followed Li et al, 2020 with additional conditions over graphs. The paper then studies structure identifiability of the model using tools from stochastic calculus. Experiments are conducted in both synthetic data sets and real-world data sets, comparing the proposed methods with alternative approaches.

### Strengths
- The paper gives an interesting connection between structural learning and SDE. The theory and practice from SDE literature builds a good foundation for this direction.
- There is a strong empirical evidence that SCOTCH performs well across multiple tasks.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper provides empirical results compared to existing models, it does not provide any analysis about obtained graphs. For me, I am more curious about the quality of produced graphs from SCOTCH compared to other models, and how we understand their structures. I wonder if there is any way to visualize the graphs.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which leverages neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and variational inference to infer posterior distributions over possible structures in continuous-time data. Traditional structure learning methods assume discrete-time processes with regularly spaced observations, which can lead to incorrect models. SCOTCH, however, is capable of handling both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. The authors establish the structural identifiability and consistency of SCOTCH under certain conditions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its superior performance compared to relevant baselines, even with irregularly sampled data.

### Strengths
1. One of the primary strengths of this paper is its originality in tackling the problem of structure learning in continuous-time data. While many existing methods focus on discrete-time processes with regular observations, SCOTCH introduces a novel approach that can handle irregularly sampled data in continuous time. 

2. The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed method. The establishment of structural identifiability conditions and the proof of consistency under infinite data limits. 

3. The paper maintains a high level of clarity in explaining the methodology, making it accessible to a wide audience. Additionally, the empirical evaluations conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCOTCH. The comparison with relevant baselines under different sampling conditions reinforces the credibility of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
1. SCOTCH relies on neural stochastic differential equation (SDE) methods, which means that its performance and computational cost are inherently linked to the accuracy of numerical SDE solvers. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth analysis and discussion regarding the sensitivity of the proposed method to the SDE solvers.

2. The paper aims to sample the structure of G and obtain a sparse G. However, it falls short in providing a thorough discussion of the reasons behind the choice of priors for structure sampling. Additionally, there is no exploration of whether achieving sparsity in G leads to improved estimation performance, or if it primarily results in more interpretable results.

### Summary
This paper introduces SCOTCH  a continuous-time stochastic model that combines stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and variational inference to model temporal processes and learn the underlying graph structure of the dynamics. The results include theory on sufficient conditions for SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable and empirical results on a variety of biomedical systems

### Strengths
-Continuous dynamics modeling is a good extension (over RHINO etc) because of the ability to incorporate irregularly sampled time series
-The Ito diffusion model is very flexible for modeling a variety of types of dynamic 
-I think that the independent diagonal noise assumption is perfectly reasonable for the generation of the dynamics 
-It is impressive that this network both learns the dynamics as well as matches the flows 
-The identifiability results are important despite their assumptions

### Weaknesses
-I think the assumptions (1, 2) should be more clearly stated (I had to comb through the text to find them)
-In specific homogenous drift and diffusion processes assumption may not be able to model some types of dynamics, some discussion on that would be interesting 
-Not sure if I believe the explanation of the improved performance of RHINO on the Netsim data

### Questions
What is the effect of the sparsity prior on the structure? Can a different type of sparsity be used?
