## Abstract
When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint. Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at
start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between
memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior
technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning
for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based
models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state-
of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST’s sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST’s inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero
compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified
RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS

### Summary
This paper looks into the problem of enhancing the quality of compression methods that use parameter sharing. It argues that existing parameter sharing methods, such as ROAST, can have instability issues during initialization and suggests a solution to reduce the instability called STABLE-RPS. The main idea of STABLE-RPS is to reshape the blocks into a single array, split it into several chunks, and apply a hashing function to determine which chunks to share parameters. The paper claims that this approach can improve the stability and pareto-continuity. Experiments on ResNet20/VGG on CIFAR10/100/TinyImagenet demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing pruning methods.

### Strengths
While parameter sharing has been heavily studied in the past, the paper made an interesting observation of the shortcomings of existing random parameter-sharing methods in terms of stability and Pareto-continuity. Furthermore, the paper proposes techniques to improve the stability and pareto-continuity of parameter sharing methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing of the paper lacks clarity and needs some major improvements. For example, the problem statement is vague --- “Is pruning the correct method to reduce model parameters?”. However, the authors do not define what are the “correct methods” for model compression. Are methods that exhibit better stability and Pareto-continuity considered as correct? Are there other correctness conditions?  The paper also uses unconvincing examples to support its arguments. For instance, the authors try to explain pruning adversely affects model capacity, and use an example "Consider pruning a n × d embedding table. If we prune beyond d×, we start getting degenerate zero embeddings." But what does "pruning beyond dx" even mean, and why is not it obvious that pruning reduces model capacity? 

2. The paper is narrowly focused on comparing with pruning-based methods, which are only a subset of the model compression techniques. The paper does not justify why pruning methods are the most relevant baselines for the proposed method, which belongs to the parameter sharing paradigm. The paper also ignores other important compression methods, such as quantization, distillation, and low rank factorization.

3. The evaluation setups are weak. Evaluation is done on tiny datasets such as CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet and very old architectures such as ResNet-20 and VGG-11 (10-year old), which raise questions on how well the observation from this work can be generalized to larger datasets, such as ImageNet, and more recent architectures, such as vision transformers.

### Questions
1. How does STABLE-RPS compare with neural architecture search based methods? Can RPS still outperform search methods in different compression settings?

2. How does the proposed method affect latency? It seems that flattening and chunking blocks would disrupt the original matrix multiplication operations, which could slow down the model execution significantly. The paper should provide latency results for the proposed method and other methods.

3. Why does Theorem 3.2 involve cache line fetches? Cache line fetches are related to execution speed, not memory efficiency. The paper should explain how cache line fetches affect the memory consumption of the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper argues towards Randomized Parameter Sharing based models. The authors identified issues and provided solutions in the RPS technique ROAST, regarding stability (ROAST’s sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST’s inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). The authors addressed this by proposing STABLE-RPS. The authors evaluated the method against many SOTA pruning methods and provided a theoretical grounding to their work.

### Strengths
Identification and Resolution of Stability, Pareto-Continuity Issues: The authors have identified key issues with existing techniques and proposed STABLE-RPS is an innovative method to address these issues 

Rigorous Theoretical Foundation: The authors have also established a strong mathematical foundation to analyze the compression methods. This rigorous approach provides clear insights into how these methods affect vector inner products and under which conditions they perform optimally.

Quality: The work done in the submission is of good quality with clear motivation and clarity. It could be a significant contribution if more empirical evidence is shown by authors.

### Weaknesses
Limited Experimental Validation: The paper could benefit more extensive experimental validation to complement the theoretical analysis. The authors only provided experimental evidence on small datasets. Given, that authors claim RPS is the way to go forward it would be good if they can follow up with more experiments

Lack of discussion around additional computation overhead in proposed STABLE-RPS method compared to other methods like ROAST. Some datapoints on what is the end to end training speedups that one can expect with this method will also help.

### Questions
Diversity of datasets: Can more experiments be done with different types of datasets and model architectures evaluated to assess the proposed method’s performance? 

Some discussion around what are there any specific scenarios where the proposed method might not perform well?

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors provide theoretical analysis, algorithmic refinement, and empirical experimentation of randomized parameter sharing (RPS) for model compression, in contrast with the prominent paradigm of parameter pruning for model compression. Guided by their theoretical analysis, the authors’ refined algorithm STABLE-RPS resolves some prior issues with existing RPS methodologies—convergence stability and ability to recover full accuracy at no compression. Further, their large scale empirical analysis reveals that STABLE-RPS can outperform nearly all pruning methods in terms of accuracy-compression tradeoff except for a leading method, lottery ticket rewinding, where STABLE-RPS only outperforms at high compression rates. Research on RPS is motivated by the objective of exploring and improving alternative paradigms for model compression that may be able to deliver better accuracy-compression tradeoff.

### Strengths
• Thorough and useful theoretical analysis of existing RPS methods which ultimately inform design of improved RPS alrogithm

• Design and implementation of STABLE-RPS algorithm which resolves two significant issues with existing RPS techniques—convergence stability and Pareto-continuity

• Extensive empirical analysis of STABLE-RPS on three datasets and two architectures compared to seven existing pruning or model compression strategies which demonstrate that STABLE-RPS can outperform nearly all pruning methods in terms of accuracy-compression tradeoff

### Weaknesses
• STABLE-RPS cannot outperform a leading pruning method, lottery ticket rewinding, in low to medium compression regime

### Questions
1. Is STABLE-RPS compatible with parameter quantization (to achieve additional compression)?

### Summary
Stable-RPS is an extension of ROAST, which is a method for sharing parameters using hashing. Parameters are mapped from a shared parameter array into each layer, along with a sign and scaling factor. The paper addresses the stability of ROAST and ensuring that the original performance of the model is maintained at 1x compression (Pareto-continuity). Modifications:

1. A gradient scaling function depending on the scaling factors applied when ROAST maps parameters to layers from the global store
2. A better hash function that ensures Pareto-continuity

The authors then demonstrate that this method of parameter sharing is competitive with contemporary pruning methods.
The authors also include various theoretical results to explain this improved performance.

### Strengths
This paper explores missing potential for random parameter sharing in deep neural networks. The early results, such as [Chen et al 2015][hashing], demonstrated competitive performance at the time but the method has received less attention since. It would be valuable for the field to have a comprehensive exploration of the potential of this direction of research.

The improvements to ROAST presented are well motivated and address clear shortcomings of an existing method. They are a good contribution to the field.

The theory investigating random parameter sharing presented in 5 theorems is a useful insight into how random parameter sharing works and will be useful to future work in this area. It seems likely that future research may focus on other alternative hashing methods and will benefit by performing similar analysis.

### Weaknesses
Figure 1 fails to explain how ROAST works or how STABLE-RPS relates to ROAST. I don't know what a ROAST array is or what a ROAST++ array is. I don't understand why the resulting Linear array has exactly the same elements (same colors) in both cases.

Equations for ROBE-Z and ROAST are insufficient. I have no way of replicating either method from these descriptions. It looks like integer and modulo division are being used but outside of pseudocode these should be defined with explanation of what they're doing in the equation.

There are 5 theorems stating results, but these results are not checked by experiment. Experimental verification would free the reader from checking the derivation or trusting that it is correct.

Parameter counts for the networks in Figure 3 would be useful, to understand how many parameters the network has at different compression levels.

### Questions
Why is there no discussion of the main limitation of random parameter sharing methods versus pruning methods: that they do not reduce the numpy of floating point operations required, while pruning methods do? If pruning methods and RPS perform similarly up to compression factors of 100x then pruning has a significant edge in saving FLOPs. When would RPS really be competitive?

Are there any experimental results on networks other than ResNet-20 or VGG-11? For the same parameter budget there are now many network architectures that perform much better. In other words, where would MobileNet or EfficientNet be placed on Figure 3? Unfortunately, as the compression ratio increases the network quickly enters regions where the accuracy is not worthwhile.

Experimental results are demonstrated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Would it be possible to explore this method on a contemporary large scale model? What would a scaling law for random parameter sharing look like?
