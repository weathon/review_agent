## Abstract
In this paper, we consider federated reinforcement learning for tabular episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) where, under the coordination of a central server, multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal policy without sharing their raw data.  While linear speedup in the number of agents has been achieved for some metrics, such as convergence rate and sample complexity, in similar settings, it is unclear whether it is possible to design a *model-free* algorithm to achieve linear *regret* speedup with low communication cost. We propose two federated Q-Learning algorithms termed as FedQ-Hoeffding and FedQ-Bernstein, respectively, and show that the corresponding total regrets achieve a linear speedup compared with their single-agent counterparts, while the communication cost scales logarithmically in the total number of time steps $T$. Those results rely on an event-triggered synchronization mechanism between the agents and the server, a novel step size selection when the server aggregates the local estimates of the state-action values to form the global estimates, and a set of new concentration inequalities to bound the sum of non-martingale differences. This is the first work showing that linear regret speedup and logarithmic communication cost can be achieved by model-free algorithms in federated reinforcement learning.

### Summary
This paper studies the federated RL and proposes two model-free algorithms---FedQ-Hoeffding and FedQ-Bernstein---that achieve regret speedup and low communication.

### Strengths
Overall, this paper has a fair contribution. It proposes two federated RL algorithms with a regret speed up and logarithmic communication.

### Weaknesses
It would be great if the authors could provide some empirical validations for their algorithm. I understand this is a theoretical work, but it is always helpful to corroborate the theoretical results with some experiments.

### Questions
- Why define $\tilde{C}$ as it is used only once (above Eq. (2)) in the main paper? 
- Case 1 at Page 5, it should be $\eqqcolon i_0$ instead of $\coloneqq i_0$.

### Summary
This work considers a federated Q-learning for tabular episodic MDP, where multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal Q-value with the aid of a central server. They proposed two federated Q-learning algorithms (FedQ-Hoeffding, FedQ-Bernstein) with event-triggered policy switching and synchronization. The algorithms provably achieve linear regret speedup while requiring communication cost logarithmically scaling with the total number of samples (T).

### Strengths
- They proposed a federated Q-learning algorithm with event-triggered synchronization, which  guarantees logarithmic communication cost in terms of T.
- They provided a finite-time regret analysis on the federated Q-learning algorithm with policy switching and proved linear regret speedup.

### Weaknesses
* Although the algorithm considers a setting that agents can collaboratively explore by changing their policies, the algorithm requires all agents to use the same fixed policy during local iterations, which seems to be quite restrictive. It would be nice if you could elaborate on the necessity of these restrictions.
* Although the paper claims that the event-triggered synchronization method is a key to reducing communication costs, the order of communication costs they showed in this paper seems to be larger than the one shown in [1], which uses just a fixed communication period. The communication cost shown in [1] not only logarithmically scales with T, but also is more efficient in terms of other factors (M: number of agents, $(1-\gamma)^{-1} (\approx H)$: length of horizon). I understand that direct comparison might be difficult given the settings are different, but I’m still not convinced that the communication cost shown in this paper is especially low. It would be nice if you could provide more detailed comparisons with recent literature to help better understand on the communication efficiency.

### Questions
* The previous federated Q-learning literature [1] already showed that communication cost logarithmically scaling with T is achievable without using event-triggered synchronization (with fixed communication period). Is there any reason to introduce event-triggered synchronization especially in this setting?
* The algorithm seems to fix the Q-values and behavior policies to be the same for all agents during local iterations. However, a setting that agents can flexibly change their policy based on their local observations before the next synchronization seems more natural to me, especially in the federated setting. Would it hurt the performance if they can change their policies and Q-estimates locally during local updates? I wonder if letting agents to change their policies can introduce some diversity in their exploration, which might be an advantage in learning.

### Summary
The paper studies federated reinforcement learning for the tabular episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP). In the model, there are $M$ agents that play in a given tabular episodic MDP and aim to minimize total regret. More formally, a tabular episodic MDP consists of $J$ episodes, where in each episode, the agents are given an adversarial picked initial state and everyone will keep picking actions till an absorbing state is reached. Each time an agent picks an action, it receives a reward that can help it update the strategy. An agent's regret for one episode is defined to be the difference between the rewards obtained by the optimal strategy and its strategy, and the goal is to minimize the sum of regrets for each agent in each episode. 

The authors first propose a federated Q-Learning algorithm and show that with a communication cost of $O(M^2H^4S^2A\log(T/M))$, the algorithm obtains a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H^4SAMT})$, where $H$ is the number of steps per episode, $T$ is the total number of steps, $S$ is the number of states in MDP, $A$ is the number of actions and $M$ is the number of agents. Further, using a higher upper confidence bound, the regret can be improved to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H^3SAMT})$ under the same communication cost.

### Strengths
- Federated reinforcement learning is a very interesting topic and the paper makes theoretical contributions in this direction. They prove that there exists a federated and model-free algorithm that achieves linear regret speedup (compared with the single-agent setting) with a relatively low communication cost.

- The paper is well-stated. In addition to describing the algorithm, some intuitions behind the algorithm design are provided in the paper.

### Weaknesses
- The main weakness is that the experimental evaluation is missing. The paper would be strengthened if an experimental section were added.

### Questions
(1) Are there any simple experimental figures for the proposed algorithms?

### Summary
The algorithm proposes a federated-style Q-learning for tabular MDPs and shows the algorithm achieves linear-speedup in terms of regret, only requiring $\log(T)$ communication rounds. Two types of uncertainty bonuses, Hoeffding and Berstein, are considered.

### Strengths
- The paper's theoretical analysis is comprehensive, comprising of both Hoeffding-style and Berstein-style bonuses.
- The paper does not analyze the UCB-style algorithms typically considered in distributed/federated RL/bandit, and instead focuses on the harder to analyze Q-learning style algorithms.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper slightly over-claims its results. The regret speedup is nearly linear, but not exactly linear, due to the overhead terms that are linear in $M$, the number of machines, that appears in both Thm 4.1 and 5.1. Immediately after Thm 4.1, the paper also states that the algorithm enjoys a linear speedup in terms of $M$ in the general FL setting, despite the presence of the overhead terms. 
2. While the typical martingale-style concentration analysis in the single agent RL setting cannot be directly applied, bounding each local term's "drift" from some "averaged parameter update path" is a commonly used technique in federated learning. 
3. Compared with contemporary or prior works on federated RL, the paper focuses on a more "vanilla" setting, where updates are allowed to be adversarial or asynchronous, the setting considered in this paper is a fairly simplified, bare bones version of federated RL.

Minor Comments
1. The term $\beta$ in eq (3) and (4) should be (at least) indexed to reflect the fact that it changes over time. Preferably, it should also indicate that the term changes with $(x, a, h)$. Otherwise, as of now, it appears that a constant is added to the Q-function estimate at every single round and is misleading.
2. It might be useful to rename paragraph "New Weight Assignment Approach" on page 7 to "Equal Weight Assignment Approach", or something similar. Currently, the phrase "equal weight assignment" is claimed to be a major contribution, but from the manuscript it is not immediately obvious what this procedure means mathematically.
3. Please see the questions below on the tightness of the technical results.
4. Due to the overall similarity between RL and bandits, some literature survey on federated/distributed bandit would be a welcomed addition to Appendix A.

### Questions
1. It is a bit surprising that the number of communication rounds is linear in $M$. Can the authors intuitively explain why this must be the case, or if this term could be removed by more involved technical analysis?
2. Can the authors provide either some lower bound or some additional justification for the overhead terms? 
3. For theorem 4.1, why can we ignore the overhead terms that are on the order of $O(HSAM\sqrt{H^3\iota} + H^4SAM)$ in the general FL setting?
