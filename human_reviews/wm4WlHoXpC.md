## Abstract
​​​​Generative models trained on internet-scale data are capable of generating novel and realistic texts, images, and videos. A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures can be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge in generating materials is the mismatch between standard generative modeling metrics and downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering novel stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by developing a unified crystal representation that can represent any crystal structure (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on these UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications, such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose additional metrics for evaluating generative models of materials, including per-composition formation energy and stability with respect to convex hulls through decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT). Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, outperforming random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials.

### Summary
This paper introduces a diffusion-based method for material generation. To adapt to the typical diffusion framework such as DDPM, the authors propose a new crystal representation, claiming to represent any crystal structures, for compatibility with UNet inputs. This representation integrates the locations of atoms within the crystal as additional dimensions of the element table, resulting in an image-like tensor analogous to those used in image-based diffusion models. In addition to applying existing metrics for evaluating material generation, the authors also propose a new evaluation approach using DFT to evaluate the physical validity of the generated materials. Experiments comparing a set of existing methods together with conditional generation are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ The paper presents a solid and novel technical contribution. The methodology distinctively diverges from existing diffusion-based material generative models by introducing a novel representation, more attuned to image-based diffusion models, which has been extensively explored in existing literature.

+ A notable strength of this paper lies in the introduction of a new evaluative metric designed to assess the physical validity of generated materials. The emphasis on the synthesizability of material generation is a refreshing approach, addressing an area that has seen limited exploration within the community. Using the DFT relaxation method from material science enhances the practical applicability and utility of the material generation method, providing deeper insights into its effectiveness and practicality.

+ The experimental outcomes presented in the paper are quite promising. The proposed method outperforms existing models by significant margins in most evaluated cases.

### Weaknesses
- The authors claim that the proposed representation is capable of capturing any crystal structure, as well as being "scalable and flexible." While the completeness of the representation is clear and well-articulated, there appears to be a lack of detailed discussion regarding its redundancy or compactness. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide further explanations or experimental insights that illuminate how compact or redundant this representation might be in practice.

- In the section discussing conditional generation, the use of conditioning variables seems somewhat unclear. Specifically, on Page 4 under "Conditioned Diffusion with UniMat," the conditioning variables are directly concatenated with the noisy material along the last dimension. However, this approach raises questions as there appears to be a disparity in the feature spaces of the conditioning variables and the noisy material. For reference, in image conditional generation, cross-attention modules are commonly used to align the input condition (like text) with the image space effectively. Without the incorporation of a similar module in this work, the mechanism by which the conditioning variables guide the generation process remains unclear.

- Regarding the method's performance, it is noted that the proposed method does not attain 100% validity on larger datasets like MP20, in contrast to simpler approaches such as CDVAE. It would enhance the paper if the authors could delve deeper into this issue, offering more insights or explanations. Including potential solutions or future directions in addressing this limitation in the limitation section would also be quite valuable.

### Questions
- In Figure 1, it might be beneficial to improve clarity by adding more descriptions or labels to the element table. It actually takes me some time to decipher that it represents an element table. Providing a more explicit explanation regarding the motivation and benefits of utilizing the element table for representation would also be advantageous. It seems that one evident benefit is the shared similarities in properties among neighboring elements in the table, potentially providing a useful prior for generation. Incorporating such observations and expanding on the motivations in the Introduction section would also be helpful.

- In Section 2.2, it could be helpful to include references to DDPM and extend the discussion slightly to incorporate considerations of other diffusion models, elaborating on why DDPM was the chosen approach. The discussion doesn’t need to be overly complicated: a straightforward explanation, such as the effective performance of DDPM in the authors’ use case, accompanied by some contextual background, would enhance the readers' understanding.

- In the section "Conditioned Diffusion with UniMat" on Page 4, the statement "While the unconditional ... training distribution" could be refined for precision and accuracy. It might be more accurate to state that DDPM primarily learns the score function rather than directly learning the training distribution, making it challenging to quantify the extent of overlap between the learned and training distributions.

- The section "Drawbacks of Learning Based Evaluations" in Section 2.3 is quite motivating. However, it might be more seamlessly integrated by briefly mentioning its main points in the Introduction. This could help prepare the reader for the detailed discussion that follows in Section 2.3.

- On Page 5 the reference format is wrong at the end of the second paragraph.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presents an new approach to materials generation using diffusion models and a novel materials representation. The authors employ diffusion models, originally designed for image generation, to generate complex material structures.

This approach is to find broad applications in materials science and chemical engineering, addressing the long-standing challenge of efficiently generating diverse materials, especially in larger and more complex systems. The models jointly handle continuous atom locations and discrete atom types, overcoming challenges associated with large and complex systems. The models are trained and tested on several datasets and are compared with previous methods. The results show that the models provide better superior generation quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
The paper's approach is innovative, offering a fresh perspective on materials generation.

UniMat is the standout contribution of this work. It offers an elegant solution to the representation of materials, particularly in the context of the periodic table. The concept of sparsity in representation, with adaptability to chemical system size, is novel.
The utilization of diffusion models together with UniMat represents a clever combination of ideas.

The generated materials of diffusion models are validated through DFT calculations. This rigorous approach ensures the stability and reliability of the generated structures.

The paper also provides a detailed background on related work in materials generation, diffusion models, and evaluation methods. This context helps readers understand the significance of their contributions. The training hyperparameters and computational resources provided in the appendix are clear and understandable.

### Weaknesses
The quality improvement of the paper is significant, especially for scaling up to large materials datasets. However, it would be helpful to provide a more in-depth analysis of the quantitative metrics and benchmarks used to make these comparisons.

### Questions
The focus of the paper is primarily on crystalline materials. Expanding the applicability of UniMat and diffusion models to non-crystalline or amorphous materials is an area that has not been explored but could be of interest to researchers in diverse fields.

The UniMat representation is a powerful concept, but its complexity might deter some researchers. Some examples in the appendix could be helpful.

It would be good to have more explanation about UniMat’s advantages. E.g. Will it save some memory or is it efficient in computing? These are also important when generating new structures.

### Summary
This paper proposes to use the diffusion model to generate novel crystal structures so as to discover novel materials. One challenge of crystal generation is the representation of a crystal structure. In this paper, the authors tackle this problem by using the atom locations in the the periodic table, the 3D coordinates of the atom in the crystal as well as maximum number of atoms per chemical element  to represent a crystal. The authors proposed methods for evaluating the generated material.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is shown to be better than previous methods quantitatively in most cases (Table 1). 

- The proposed method generates crystal structures closer to those in the test set than the baseline method CDVAE.

### Weaknesses
- There is no innovation in the diffusion model and the AI part. This paper just uses the standard diffusion model, and the conditional diffusion model to generate crystal structures. 

- I understand this paper may be a good paper for material science. Another venue related to material science, physics or chemistry may be a good venue to maximize the impact of this work. This paper presented at ICLR may have a small number of audience. In addition, Sec. 2.3, evaluating the generated materials using energy, is purely material science and has nothing related to AI. AI Researchers probably cannot evaluate the correctness and novelty of Sec. 2.3. Also, for the AI community, we do not learn any novel AI knowledge from this paper.

### Questions
I would suggest the authors submit this work to a more related venue to maximize the impact of this work.

### Summary
This work proposes a diffusion model for the task of material generation. Their model takes the material with atom locations as input and performs the denoising process by moving atoms from random locations to their original locations. The output results in crystals. The method is evaluated on three material generation datasets and compared against previous work in the topic.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The theoretical background is well explained and clear.

2. The idea of modeling the atom movement for material generation using diffusion models and the denoising process is interesting and novel to the best of my knowledge. I am not an expert in materials science, so I am not sure about the method novelty here.

### Weaknesses
1. The utilized benchmarks seem to be saturated with values close to 100% performance. The performance gain is marginal and therefore could be a random improvement. Also, in some of the cases, the previous work has already achieved 100%, so there is no room for improvement.

2. There is another work that uses diffusion models for the same task on the same datasets [a]. Although [a] uses diffusion models in a different way compared to this work, it has similar or better performance in some cases.

[a] Pakornchote, Teerachote, et al. "Diffusion probabilistic models enhance variational autoencoder for crystal structure generative modeling." arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.02165 (2023).

### Questions
1. Since ICLR is an ML conference, the paper would benefit from explaining the different evaluation criteria and their importance in the material generation task. E.g. what are the property statistics exactly and do they have higher importance compared to validity?

2. The paper could be contrasted and compared against [a].
