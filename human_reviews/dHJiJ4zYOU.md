## Abstract
Disentanglement and compositional generalization are essential abilities for humans, as they enable rapid knowledge acquisition and generalization to new tasks. These abilities involve recognizing fundamental underlying concepts from observations and generating novel concept combinations. However, deep learning models often struggle with these capabilities. Numerous studies have proposed methods for disentangled representation learning, while recent research has also begun to address compositional generalization. Despite these advancements, the relationship between disentanglement and compositional generalization remains under-explored, with inconsistent findings reported in existing literature. In this paper, we analyze various prominent disentangled representation learning methods, examining their disentanglement and compositional generalization capabilities. Our study reveals a crucial insight: adopting vector-valued representations (using vectors rather than scalars to represent concepts) significantly enhances both disentanglement and compositional generalization performance. This insight resonates with findings from neuroscience research, which suggest that the brain encodes information through the collective activity of neuron populations, rather than relying on individual neurons. Motivated by this observation, we further propose a method to reform the scalar-valued disentanglement works ($\beta$-TCVAE and FactorVAE) to be vector-valued to increase both capabilities. We investigate the impact of the dimensions of vector-valued representation and one important question: whether better disentanglement indicates higher compositional generalization. In summary, our study establishes the feasibility of attaining both effective concept recognition and novel concept composition.

### Summary
This paper investigates the hypothesis that using vector (rather than scalar) representations for disentangled latent variables improves both disentanglement and compositional generalization. It introduces vectorized variants of three existing methods for disentangled representation learning (beta-TCVAE, FactorVAE, and SAE) and also a de-vectorized version of VCT. The results show improved accuracy across the board for vectorized versions of the methods.

Note: I previously reviewed this an earlier version manuscript for another conference.

### Strengths
The paper investigates an interesting hypothesis and proposes a number of new methods as part of its investigation. It conducts experiments on 2 different datasets which allows a minimal assessment of generalizability, and it also evaluates more than one metric for disentanglement as well as compositional generalization. The results are striking.

### Weaknesses
The method of vectorizing an existing method seems to be based on ad-hoc heuristics and not particularly generalizable. In the case of beta-TCVAE, vectorization amounts having components of a vector being constrained to the same variance, and for the total correlation to be evaluated within each dimension. These modifications do not seem very principled and are more like heuristics. In the case of SAE, it seems like one simply increases dimensionality by a factor, although I could be wrong since I'm not familiar with the SAE method.

The paper includes experiments claiming to demonstrate the difference between vectorization and increased dimensionality. These show that for an "ideal" representation, both vectorized and scalar methods perform well. But this observation fails to demonstrate the difference between vectorized methods and increased-dimensionality scalar methods in non-ideal settings. A more straightforward comparison between vectorized methods and matched-dimension scalar methods would be more conclusive.

### Questions
* How does "vec-SAE" differ from SAE with more dimensions?
* Can you give a more systematic set of principles for vectorizing a VAE-type method, that would help the reader to vectorize a method not covered by your paper?

### Summary
The paper explores the relation between disentanglement and compositional generalisation when each factor value is encoded using vector-valued representations as opposed to scalar-values ones (as is common in previous work). To this end the paper expands the definition of standard disentanglement penalties (used for training) and metrics (for evaluation) to the vector-value case. They then use apply them to a handful of models in order to probe their disentanglement and generalisation properties. The authors find that when using said vector-valued there is a positive correlation between disentanglement (as measured using several metrics) and the generalisation capabilities across all models. This highlighting the importance of distributed representations on the generalisation ability of Deep Learning models.

### Strengths
The idea of expanding the study of disentanglement to the vector based cased is a natural next step from previous work that uses scalar valued representations. The main hypothesis is thus clear. The description of how the different penalties and metrics are extended is also easy to understand. Finally, the results support the conclusion that the authors reach, i.e. that there is a positive correlation between disentanglement and generalisation when using vector-values representations.

### Weaknesses
In spite of the above there are some issues that need addressing before I can recommend publication. In no particular order:

1. There are some important references that the authors have missed: Schott et al. (2021), and Montero et al., (2022) for example goes beyond the VAE-based disentanglement studies of Montero 2021, though they are still restricted to the scalar-values case. The authors also cite Singh et al., (2022) but don't mention that this reference talks about compositional generalisation and vector valued representations. This is the most relevant reference for this study, yet there is no discussion about the relation between the two.
2. Section 2.2 is a bit confusing and needs a rewrite. As currently written, it is stated that disentanglement has not been considered when studying generative models, but the authors themselves stated before that both Montero et al. and Xu et al. study both in the VAE-based setting, a generative model. So which one is it? Also, Xu is not the only one to use random splits. Schott et al., also dies this.
3. The structure based disentanglement needs much more details to be understandable. The short explanation and the figure are not nearly enough to understand why this is an interesting model to test.
4. The authors claim to use the beta-VAE and MIG metrics but they never appear in the table.

### Questions
1. What are metrics like accuracy, r2 applied to? The full vector-values representation? What are the targets?
2. The implications paragraph in section 6.3 is completely unclear to me.
3. Relatedly, I personally I believe that DCI is the most accurate disentanglement measure, so it is striking that vector-values representation are not providing any improvement and this severely undermines the conclusions of the paper, especially since the authors don't say how the are applying the other metrics.

### Summary
The authors study the challenge of compositional generalization and its relationship to disentanglement. Specifically, they propose that leveraging ideas of vector-valued disentanglement has the potential to improve the performance of disentangled representation learning methods on compositional generalization tasks. They introduce multiple methods in order to extend existing scalar-valued models of disentanglement to their vector-valued setting, and demonstrate that indeed these models appear to yield greater accuracy on a test of compositional generalization. They further study the correlation between disentanglement and compositional generalization, showing that there appears to be a relationship between the two tasks for classification metrics, but not for regression metrics.

### Post Rebuttal Edit
We thank the authors for their extensive response to our review and for addressing our major concerns. We greatly appreciate their inclusion of dimensionality matching models, and believe this has significantly improved the quality of the paper. For this reason we have raised our score. We would ultimately like to see all models with matching dimensionality, regardless of their number of parameters since it is likely that the number of parameters has a significantly lesser influence on disentanglement than latent dimensionality. Equivalently the authors may increase the number of parameters in their vector valued models in order to equate the two on other terms. However, at this stage we still think the comparison for FactorVAEs and Beta TCVAEs is valuable on its own and therefore can be satisfied to weakly recommend acceptance of the work. We furthermore appreciate the authors increasing the clarity of their notation and for updating their related work.

### Strengths
- The paper is relatively well written and easy to read.
- The topic of vector-valued disentanglement is very interesting and under-explored. Specifically, the relationship to compositional generalization is also interesting, and if their findings can be shown to hold, this would have a significant impact on the field.
- Performance on compositional generalization is very high and there is a clear significant difference between vector valued and scalar valued models on the two datasets examined (although the methodological procedure raises some doubts, see weaknesses).

### Weaknesses
- It appears that one of the main experimental findings of the paper (the fact that vector valued representations are correlated with improved compositional generalization) may be conflated with the simple increase in dimensionality resulting from increasing the dimension of the latent space. Specifically, in Table 1, it appears the authors did not maintain a comparable latent dimensionality between their scalar-valued and vector-valued models. (For example, it currently appears all vector valued models have a latent dimensionality which is D-times bigger than the scalar valued baselines). As shown by the authors in Figure 2, this simple increase in dimensionality yields dramatic improvements to compositionality metrics even for the vanilla baseline Vec-AE. The authors attempt to address this concern in Section 6.4, Table 3, however they only compare 2 models on a single dataset, and furthermore do not include standard deviations (!). Unfortunately, given this is one of the main results of the paper, I believe this is insufficient. All scalar-valued baselines for Table 1 should have consistent total dimensionality with the vector valued counterparts, especially considering this is shown to have a significant impact on performance. I would ask the authors to include these results in a rebuttal in order to have faith in the main claims of the paper.

- The extension of scalar valued models to vector valued versions is a bit confusing and ill-defined, as outlined below:
	- Equation (5) is confusing due to potential overload of indexing notation. It would be helpful if the authors put bounds on their sums in this case so that it is clear exactly which vector is being referred to by z_j. Is this the j’th vector (of dimension D)? Or a new vector composed of the j’th dimensions of all other vectors (E.g. something like [z_{0,j}, z_{1,j}, z_{2,j}, …, z_{m,j}])?
	- If I understand equation (5) correctly, the new Total Correlation loss is really only seeking to minimise the element-wise total correlation of the individual vectors, meaning for example that the second dimension of the first vector (z_{1,2}) and the first dimension of the second vector (z_{2,1}) have no penalty on their correlation. Similarly, for the dimensions within a vector, there is no constraint on correlation. Is this true? If so, this seems like a quite significant departure from the original TCVAE idea. It would be appreciated if the authors could provide greater motivation for why this is a good disentanglement loss in their model.
	- The derivation of Equation (5) in the appendix is not given. The authors derive why the original approximation is no longer fit, but then simply propose the new total correlation loss without much discussion. Further justification of this loss should be included. If the authors could comment on that here, that would be greatly appreciated.
	- A more detailed description of all vector valued methods should be provided (for example the Vec-FactorVAE should be described entirely in the appendix).

- Some references to related work are missing. Notably, there is a line of work related to the discovery of vector-valued directions in latent space which correspond to disentangled transformations [1,2,3]. It would be helpful if the authors could address this line of work as well, as I believe it is at least related conceptually. 

- The authors provide little to no intuition for why a vector valued representation may achieve compositional generalization better than a scalar value counterpart.

- In Table 1, the authors bold their values (for FactorVAE metric and DCI) which are not significantly above the baseline scalar-valued models. This is potentially misleading, and the authors should either bold all values that are not statistically significantly different, or they should remove the bolding.

### Questions
- What is the marginal q(z_j) in equation (5) referring to?
- Can the authors provide a compelling reason for why they did not match the dimensionality of the baseline scalar-valued models and vector-valued models in Table 1?

### Summary
The paper investigates the relationship between disentanglement and compositional generalization when varying the dimension of factors of variation (i.e., scalar and vector valued factors).

### Strengths
- The paper is very well written and easy to understand.
- The paper performs thorough experiments to understand how employing scalar/vector valued representations effect disentanglement and compositional generalization capabilities. 
- The experiments showing the role of bottleneck size (in the case of vector valued representations) and how it effects disentanglement and generalization capabilities are very helpful.

### Weaknesses
None as such.

### Questions
- Ways to improve approximation of total correlation for vector valued representations could be further helpful to improve the results of the paper. 
- it will be helpful to see if the learned vector valued representations can further boosts downstream results in case of visual reasoning problems or RL problems. 
- The key message behind the paper (vector valued representations are important for compositional generalization) had already been argued in previous work (like RIMs [1] or its followers, or Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck [2]).
