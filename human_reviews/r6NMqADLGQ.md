## Abstract
We study the problem of _unsupervised heteroscedastic covariance estimation_, where the goal is to learn the multivariate target distribution $\mathcal{N}(y, \Sigma_y | x )$ given an observation $x$. This problem is particularly challenging as $\Sigma_{y}$ varies for different samples (heteroscedastic) and no annotation for the covariance is available (unsupervised). Typically, state-of-the-art methods predict the mean $f(x ; \theta)$ and covariance $Cov(f(x); \Theta)$ of the target distribution through two neural networks trained using the negative log-likelihood. 
This raises two questions: (1) Does the predicted covariance truly capture the randomness of the predicted mean? (2) In the absence of ground-truth annotation, how can we quantify the performance of covariance estimation? 
We address (1) by developing the __Spatial Variance__, a formulation of $Cov(f(x); \Theta)$ that captures the randomness in $ f(x ; \theta)$ by incorporating its curvature around $x$. Furthermore, we tackle (2) by introducing the _Conditional Mean Absolute Error (C-MAE)_, a metric which leverages well-known properties of the normal distribution. We verify the effectiveness of our approach through multiple experiments spanning synthetic (univariate, multivariate) and real-world datasets (UCI Regression, LSP, and MPII Human Pose Estimation). Our experiments provide evidence that our approach outperforms the state of the art across these datasets and multiple network architectures, and accurately learns the relation underlying the target random variables.

### Rating
1: strong reject

### Rating Number
1

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper studies a conditional covariance estimation problem, where the covariance can vary depending on the conditioned random variable $x$. The paper points out that using NLL can be problematic and propose an alternative formulation and a metric. The paper applies the proposed scheme on various datasets and compares with other baselines.

### Strengths
- Related papers are thoroughly reviewed.

- Experiment is comprehensive and covers various datasets.

### Weaknesses
- Although the paper studies a theoretical problem (conditional covariance estimation), a precise probabilistic statement of the problem is nowhere provided. I was confused starting from the first paragraph, which says ``$p(y | x)$ follows $N(y, \Sigma_{y | x})$''. Isn't $y$ a random variable? How can a random variable be a conditional mean of itself? Not only in this paragraph, but in many other places throughout the paper, the notations $y, \hat{y}, f(x), f_\theta(x)$ were carelessly used, making the paper almost impossible to understand. I believe the paper can be much improved by clearly defining the problem (under which probability distribution the data is generated, which parameter is being estimated, what assumptions are used, etc.).

- Most equations in the paper remain at the level of heuristic. While it is okay to have a heuristic explanation of the proposed method, the way it is presented in the current draft is unnecessarily confusing. For example, how do we even define the limit in Eq. (1)? I think the paper should try to minimize the use of non-rigorous math.

### Questions
- To my knowledge, conditional mean/covariance estimation is impossible without further assumption (e.g. regularity of $\mu_{y | x}, \Sigma_{y | x}$). I wonder how the authors avoided this problem.

- Most figures are missing axis labels. For example, Figure 1 is placed in the very beginning of paper without explaining what the curves are.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of unsupervised covariance estimation when the covariance is not homogeneous across samples. Current solution use neural networks with negative log-likelihood objectives. They show that the obtained solutions for the covariance do not take into account the randomness in the mean estimation. To tackle that, they propose a solution that capture the randomness in the mean by incorporating local curvature around the samples. Furthermore, they propose an evaluation metric Conditional Mean Absolute Error (C-MAE) to quantify the covariance estimation in the absence of annotations.

### Strengths
The paper tackles an important practical problem for statistical machine learning. The proposed spatial variance motivated by taking into curvature around samples is a nice approach to account for uncertainty in mean and covariance estimation. The new proposed metric C-MAE would also be useful in other applications involving statistics estimations in unsupervised settings as an alternative to log-likelihood.

### Weaknesses
The computational complexity of the approach could be an issue as the paper tackles a practical estimation problem. The paper does not compare to other approaches to log-likelihood such as Lotfi, S., Izmailov, P., Benton, G., Goldblum, M., & Wilson, A. G. (2022, June). Bayesian model selection, the marginal likelihood, and generalization. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 14223-14247). PMLR.

### Questions
- In Section 2.1, \sigma_{\Theta} has not been defined. Is it a scalar that is assuming a diagonal covariance matrix?, How do you go from Cov(\hat{y}) to \sigma_{\Theta} ?
- The sentence after Equation (6) is incomplete: "We note that both both Cov() and Cov()..."
- What is the theoretical explanation motivating the use of the thirs matrix term k_3(x). It is said in the paper, that the curvature of the function at x cannot alone explain the stochasticity of the samples which motivate the use of k_3(x). It would then be appropriate to motivate the definition of "spatial covariance" by the the "curvature of x" and of "?" coming from k_3(x). Could the authors please elaborate more on this?
-The following paper proposes "Conditional Marginal likelihood" as an alternative to the likehood (although for generalisation context): Lotfi, S., Izmailov, P., Benton, G., Goldblum, M., & Wilson, A. G. (2022, June). Bayesian model selection, the marginal likelihood, and generalization. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 14223-14247). PMLR. This relates to your definition of C-MAE. Could you elaborate on the differences between the two metrics and possibly compare them in the current setting?
- The computational complexity of the approach could be an issue as the paper tackles a practical estimation problem. Could the authors please provide an exact analysis of the computational complexity of the method and suggest possible ways of improvement?

### Summary
The authors propose a novel approach to train covariances, stemming from the observation that, when learning Gaussian models, the mean and the covariance are independently parametrised but they affect one another during training. Consequently, they define a new parametrisation for the covariance that is *tied* to the curvature of the mean function around its argument. The approach is compared to ML and other recent methods using synthetic and real-world data, such comparison is performed under a novel performance indicator for covariance modelling introduced in this paper too.

### Strengths
The idea of questioning the standard approach to training covariances is undoubtedly of interest to the community. Furthermore, developing this new approach and a performance indicator is a valuable contribution.

### Weaknesses
Although the general idea is attractive and, to some extent, promising, the concept is not properly exploited in the article. In this regard, the most relevant weaknesses of the paper are: 

- Generally, the paper could be clearer, and its format can be improved. For instance: 
    - the abstract (5th line) defines the mean of a Gaussian as $f(x)$, and the covariance as $Cov(f(x))$. So, it is not clear whether $f(x)$ refers to the RV to be modelled or its mean.
    - Figs 1 and 2 are not referred to in the body of the paper, and they are not self-explanatory either. To this Reviewer, their purpose is not clear. 
    - Tables span beyond the margins of the text
    - A few times, it is mentioned that the experiments are run over _multiple network architectures_; however, in the experiments, there is no mention of specific architectures used
    - gaussian, hessian -> Gaussian, Hessian
    - axis labels in Fig 3 are too small

- Also, in the line of clarity, the paper is motivated by the pitfalls of maximum likelihood (ML). However, the proposal in the paper results in a specific parametrisation of the covariance, which ties the structure of the covariance and the mean (eq 8 shows how the covariance contains the Jacobian of the mean function). Therefore, the proposal is not _another training strategy_ but rather a covariance parametrisation. As a matter of fact, after eq 8 the authors state that their parametrisation is used alongside ML. 

- Benchmarks are unclear: The experiments compare the proposed parametrisation against **NLL** (though the proposed method also uses NLL as far as I understand), **Diagonal**, which I assume also uses NLL and other methods. It is thus confusing if the paper compares approaches to training covariances or models for covariances.  

- Another point worth noticing is the fact that the paper proposes a variance parametrisation and also a performance indicator (C-MAE). However, this is the only performance indicator used in the experiments, meaning that other than the conceptual justification of C-MAE (which I find valid), there is no experimental validation. This means that the authors propose a model and use their own defined metric to assess it.   

- There should be given more details about the choice of $k_1,k_2,k_3$, the networks, and the learning objectives.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method to lean the multivariate target distribution, namely the mean and heteroscedastic covariance. The authors contributions are two folds: 1) a concept of spatial variance by studying the curvature around input x. 2) conditional mean absolute error for evaluations.

### Strengths
Overall I believe the paper is well motivated, and new concepts such as spatial variance are clearly presented. The experiment sections are also thorough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Originality: Two key concepts presented in this paper (spatial variance and C-MAE) are novel. 

Quality: The paper is written with good quality. The authors motivated the problem well, provided detailed derivations and extensive experiment results.

Clarity: The paper is easy to follow.

Significant: The paper is important as it provides a new method for heteroscedastic covariance learning.

### Weaknesses
See questions below.

### Questions
I mainly have the following several questions:

The C-MAE operates like a leave one out fashion. In general for multi-variate Gaussian, we can do any leave-k-out. Would it provide more info if the consider any k greater than 1? Or mainly, the authors may want to illustrate the specific choice of leave one out here.
What are the specific choice considerations for k1, k2 and k3? Would any regularity conditions further help with supervision?
