## Abstract
We investigate the mechanism design problem faced by a principal who hires \emph{multiple} agents to gather and report costly information. Then, the principal exploits the  information to make an informed decision.  We model this problem as a game, where the principal announces a mechanism consisting in action recommendations and a payment function, a.k.a. scoring rule. Then, each agent chooses an effort level and receives partial information about an underlying state of nature based on the effort. Finally, the agents report the information (possibly non-truthfully), the principal takes a decision based on this information, and the agents are paid according to the scoring rule. While previous work focuses on single-agent problems, we consider multi-agents settings. This poses the challenge of coordinating the agents' efforts and aggregating correlated information. Indeed, we show that optimal mechanisms must correlate agents' efforts, which introduces externalities among the agents, and hence complex incentive compatibility constraints and equilibrium selection problems. First, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal incentive compatible mechanism. Then, we study an online problem, where the principal repeatedly interacts with a group of unknown agents. We design a no-regret algorithm that provides $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret with respect to an optimal mechanism, matching the state-of-the-art bound for single-agent settings.

### Summary
The paper studies an online information acquisition problem. In the model, a principal interacts with a group of agents. The principal uses a mechanism to recommend actions for the agents to perform and to decide payments for the agents. The mechanism also elicits information from the agents about their observations of the state of nature. Besides the interactions, the principal also takes an action after the agents perform actions and report their observations. The paper first presents an algorithm based on linear programming to compute the optimal mechanism in the full information setting. It then studies a learning problem where the transition probabilities are unknown. A no-regret algorithm that gurantees sublinear regret is provided for the learning setting.

### Strengths
The problem studied is well-motivated. The paper presented a number of results and is mostly clear. The analysis looks solid and technically sound.

### Weaknesses
The algorithms presented look very standard even though the model is a more complicated one. The LP algorithm, for example, is based on the same formulation for standard principal-agent mechanism design problem -- by maximizing the principal's utility under the agents' truthful behavior and using IC constraints to enforce this behavior. While I appreciate the effort it takes to set up the constraints for this more complicated model, the insights the approach yields are somewhat limited. The same can be said about the learning algorithms. 

Besides that, some specifications of the uncorrelated mechanisms are not well justified (see Questions). The model itself does not look scalable with respect to the number of agents because of the exponential growth of joint action profiles.

### Questions
Why uncorrelated mechanisms are not dependent on the agents' actions as are the correlated mechanisms? I think the mechanism is still uncorrelated if \gamma_i also depends on the action of agent i. 

Similarly, why not keep the principal's action policy \pi dependent on the agents' actions? The principal's action does not seem to have any influence on the agents' payoffs, so keeping it dependent on the agents' actions will not introduce any actual externalities among the agents. 

Some typos: 

- In Equation (2b), in the term z_i[b_i, b_i', s], the "s" should be "s_i"?

- On page 5, there is a displayed equation that defines \mathcal{U}. In the part \gamma_i: S_i \times \Theta \in [0, M], the symbol "\in" should be "\to"?

### Summary
The authors study the problem of online acquiring information of the unobserved world state ($\theta$) from a group of strategic agents under the principal-agent framework.
The challenges of the online problems are in three folds:

1. The agents are strategic, meaning they could deviate from the principal's action recommendation and report fraud signals. Thus, the exploration phase (with uncorrelated scoring rule) is needed to ensure IC.
2. The cost differences $C_i(b_i, b_i')$ are unobservable by the principal, which prohibits standard RL methods (via estimating the agents' cost directly) and essentiates the binary searching method.
3. In the multiple-agent setup, the number of constraints can be growing dramatically without any reduction. 

This paper formulates the multi-agent information acquisition problem, reduces the problem to linear programming that can be solved in polynomial time, and provide online learning guarantee.
In particular, the authors show there is a clear separation between the uncorrelated and the correlated mechanism.

### Strengths
For originality, the authors formulation of the information elicitation problem under the multi-agent setting. I appreciate the discussions of the computation issue and the separation between the correlated/uncorrelated scoring mechanism. Overall, the paper is well written, but a little bit redundant in terms of the notations. The paper achieves state-of-art learning guarantee for the multiple-agent setting. The algorithm design and the analysis look sound to me.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors should make it clear if agents can communicate with each other their signals/actions or not, as this can cause a huge difference. I understood that the agents cannot communicate with each other by forms of the deviation functions. Please correct me if I'm wrong. 
2. There are some typos that could cause confusions, e.g., it should be $\sum_{s'\in\mathcal{S}:s_i'=s_i\mathbb{P}(s' \| b, \theta)}$ at the bottom of Page 2.
3. The authors may need to justify Assumption 1, perhaps by providing examples where the set of scoring rules known by the principal in advance can be effectively learned, e.g., by random searching, or constructed.

### Questions
1. Could the author provide a detailed comparison between the information acquisition framework and the Bayesian Correlated Equilibrium (BCE) (Bergemann, D. 2016)? It seems to me that if the agents are not allowed to communicate with each other, these IC concepts are closely related and similar challenges occur for the learning phase. 
2. If the costs of the follower are directly observable, can the learning rate be improved?
3. Is the independency assumption $\mathbb{P}^{(i)}(s_i| b, \theta) = \mathbb{P}^{(i)}(s_i| b_i, \theta)$ necessary? If so, without the independency assumption, what could be added to the difficulty in terms of computation and statistical learning?

### Summary
The research paper delves into the dynamics of online information acquisition among multiple agents, providing a comprehensive analysis of how to design the mechanism that influences individuals' decisions. Besides, this paper designs a polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal incentive compatible mechanism.

### Strengths
1. Algorithmic Design and Optimization in Multi-Agent Settings: This paper works on designing an efficient algorithm for the multi-agent information acquisition problem, addressing both the optimization and online learning dimensions of interactions between a principal and unknown agents. The proposed algorithm, which navigates through a quadratic optimization problem via linear relaxation, culminates in a polynomial-time solution to the original problem. 

2. Addressing Uncertainty in Online Learning: The transition to online learning scenarios, characterized by the principal’s lack of knowledge regarding game parameters, is handled with a robust algorithmic approach, achieving a ($\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$) regret. This aligns with state-of-the-art benchmarks in single-agent settings.

3. Ensuring Truthfulness and Optimality: They first discussed the relationship between the optimal design and the correlated and uncorrelated mechanism. They also introduce the novel definition of regret as the difference between the optimal (correlated + IC) and suboptimal (uncorrelated + IC, correlated + NonIC). The final phase of the algorithm, committed to achieving an approximately optimal strategy while upholding truthfulness under uncertainty. The authors leverage estimations from previous phases to find an approximately optimal and incentive-compatible mechanism, subsequently combining it with a strictly incentive-compatible scoring rule. This approach demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the trade-offs and complexities involved in designing mechanisms that balance optimality and incentive compatibility.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper would benefit significantly from the inclusion of empirical demonstrations to substantiate the theoretical assertions made therein. 

2. In terms of sample size efficiency, the paper presents an opportunity for enhancement through the integration of more sample-efficient online learning algorithms, such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling. These methodologies hold potential for yielding a more favorable regret profile.

3. The articulation throughout the paper necessitates refinement. This is particularly pertinent in relation to the elucidation of the implications associated with the various theorems and lemmas presented, which requires additional clarity and precision.

### Questions
1. Is there any real examples of the optimal mechanism that are uncorrelated?

2. Is there any simulations, real data to demonstrate the effective of this ETC algorithm?

3. Typo: $\alpha ==$ to $\alpha=$.

### Summary
The paper is concerned with mechanism design where there is a principle who wants to know some state theta to take an action that maximizes utility. To estimate theta the principle uses reported signals from agents. The paper begins with the correlated mechanism setting and shows how to solve the problem using LP methods with some modifications. The paper then discusses uncorrelated mechanism showing that they are sub-optimal in general settings and optimal in some restricted settings. Finally, the online setting is considered, and the paper proposes an algorithm that follows the classical explore then commit paradigm in bandits.

### Strengths
-The problem seems well-motivated and the model captures a wide set of applications.  

-I think the paper has interesting results such as characterization of optimality and suboptimality of uncorrelated mechanisms in section 4.

-I did not check the proofs carefully. But the technical details in the paper seem interesting.

### Weaknesses
A-The presentation of the paper can be improved. There seem to be some missing text, see the following:
         
          1-what is the auxiliary variables z_i in eq (2c) equal to? Further, Theorem 3.1 has a collection of values C_1, C_n, have they been specified? 

          2-3rd line in section 2, why are some c’s (for the cost function) capitalized and others are not

          3-in the cumulative regret formula on page 6, why is T’_c not included is it because it is assumed to be empty, I found this sentence to be confusing “as discussed in Section 4, we used the fact that when the principal commits to a correlated mechanism which is not IC, then she can incur in a constant per-round regret in the worst case, since the behavior of the agents is unpredictable ”


B-In theorem 5.1, is it not reasonable to have a setting where $\ell$ and/or $\iota$ can equal zero? Would this not break the algorithm?

### Questions
Please see points A and B in the weaknesses above. Especially point B. Another question I have is the following:

-In mechanism design settings it is reasonable to consider agents engaging in collusion. I did not find comments in the paper about that. This is not necessarily a weakness, since one may just ignore the collusion issue in a problem.
