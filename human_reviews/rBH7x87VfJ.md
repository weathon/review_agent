# Random Sparse Lifts: Construction, Analysis and Convergence of finite sparse networks

- Avg Score: 6.50
- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
We present a framework to define a large class of neural networks for which, by construction, training by gradient flow provably reaches arbitrarily low loss when the number of parameters grows. Distinct from the fixed-space global optimality of non-convex optimization, this new form of convergence, and the techniques introduced to prove such convergence, pave the way for a usable deep learning convergence theory in the near future, without overparameterization assumptions relating the number of parameters and training samples. We define these architectures from a simple computation graph and a mechanism to lift it, thus increasing the number of parameters, generalizing the idea of increasing the widths of multi-layer perceptrons. We show that architectures similar to most common deep learning models are present in this class, obtained by sparsifying the weight tensors of usual architectures at initialization. Leveraging tools of algebraic topology and random graph theory, we use the computation graph’s geometry to propagate properties guaranteeing convergence to any precision for these large sparse models.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes a "lifting" procedure on a general computational graph. Randomizing over these lifts, the authors show that training converges with high probability.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a really interesting idea which to the best of my knowledge is novel.

2. The authors tackle a notationally dense topic with care and precision, even including a notational glossary in the appendix.

3. Presentation and logical flow are excellent, paper is easy to follow.

4. The theory seems well fleshed out (e.g., showing well-definedness in appendix K), although I did not check the proofs.

### Weaknesses
1. It's a shame that the authors did not include concrete experiments training their lifted models. I would be interested to see empirical tests validating the theory: i.e., actually do $n$ random lifts, train via sgd, and see what percent of the time it converges.

2. I have reservations about assumption A1. The set $A_{s,g}(\kappa, \epsilon)$ echoes ideas from neural tangent kernel approximation -- as the authors note, it includes not only weights which are close to $f^*$, but also weights which can be made close to $f^*$ by moving a little bit $u$ in the tangent approximation to the network. The NTK argument justifies this by showing that, under some random initialization, networks are close to their linear approximation as their width goes to infinity. Assumption 1 essentially starts by assuming that the tangent assumption is reasonable, and then states a lower bound on the size of the set of weights that can be made close to $f^*$ by moving in the tangent plane. So in effect they seem to be _assuming_ what NTK analyses _concludes_ from infinite-width scaling. In that light, the fact that this paper claims convergence guarantees for finite-width networks does not seem that impressive.

I am happy to raise my score if either of the above points are adequately addressed, as I actually found the paper quite interesting. I was originally inclined to give a stronger recommendation but my understanding on (2) seems to be a serious limitation.

Small remark / suggestion: some sentences are somewhat difficult to parse due to length, especially in the intro. For example: "Distinct from the fixed-space global optimality of non-convex optimization, this new form of convergence, and the techniques introduced to prove such convergence, pave the way for a usable deep learning convergence theory in the near future, without overparameterization assumptions relating the number of parameters and training samples"

### Questions
1. What do the authors mean when they say that networks whose width is not increasing with depth "could be ill-behaved"?

2. I didn't follow the sentence: ""Lastly, if there are many such subnetworks, then a small modification of parameters cannot substantially modify them all if the large network is large enough."

As I am not familiar with the field I cannot give a confident review, although I hope the authors will be able to atleast dispell my concerns about weakness 2 above.

### Summary
This paper proposes random sparse lifts for neural networks and shows their convergence under gradient flow

### Strengths
Since the reviewer is not very well versed in this area of research and could not fully follow the technical part of this paper within a short amount of time, the decision should default to the other reviewers.

### Weaknesses
See "Questions"

### Questions
1. The discussion in Section 2 seems to suggest that the convergence analysis is an extension of the existing NTK analysis, how does the results in this paper different?
2. How should one understand the $\mathcal{C}$ in LiftPMod? The example given in the paper is not very helpful. It would be great if an example of random sparse lift is given for a specific NN architecture, say multi-layer feedforward networks.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new class of neural networks, in particular multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), with provable convergence guarantees when the number of parameters is large. The initial architectures are "lifted" to large sparse models. Tools from graph theory are used to represent these non-standard architectures in a graphical form and discuss the mapping in between them.

### Strengths
The graph-based method to represent neural networks seems powerful. I also enjoyed the idea of giving convergence guarantees for the pair of architecture and parameters where the architecture is built in a way to be within the proximity of the target function where the tangent approximation holds.

### Weaknesses
Although the approach and results look interesting and might be promising, unfortunately, I found the paper incomprehensible. See some specific points below

* The text is way too informal. The first sentence starts with "trying to learn...". 
* Already in the first paragraph, $\theta$ is both an arbitrary variable and the true variable which I found confusing. I'd suggest changing it to "for some parameter $\theta^*$".
* It is not clear why a long list of citations from approximation theory (page 1) is given since the paper studies convergence. 
* In many places, claims are unjustified. For example, 'the class of neural networks that can be described .. more expressive than Tensor Programs". Why is that so? It would be OK not to explain this if it was a trivial statement.
* Informal text: "full-support type assumption" on page 2. 
* It is not clear to me how Theorem 2.1 helps the paper. As the authors say, it is a slight extension of Robin et al. 2022 with a very similar proof technique. It would help to add an intuitive explanation of how this result will be used in the paper. 
* I have not seen how the class of architectures introduced here includes/related to convolutional neural networks. 
* The definition of the random sparse lifts (which is in the title of the paper) comes on the last page (Def 4.2). This is very unusual and it makes it nearly impossible to follow up with the text until the last page. I'd kindly suggest arranging the text in the following order: (i) introduce the definitions (only those elements needed for the main theorem) (ii) main theorem (Theorem 4.3) (iii) discuss generalizations to other architectures such as transformers.

### Questions
In conclusion, it is stated that the theory of this paper gives a route to strong convergence results and **testable empirical predictions**. Is there any justification for how this method can be used for testable empirical predictions in the paper?

### Summary
The paper is on the topic of proving global loss convergence for deep neural networks, which is challenging due to the presence of non-convexities. The paper describes a lifting procedure that generalizes the notion of overparameterization in the usual dense, fully-connected settings (for example in deep fully-connected MLPs). The resulting lifted networks can be sparse (which is a big difference to previous analyses of this type), which then allows for tools from algebraic topology to be used to ensure global convergence.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written with clear definitions, motivations, sketches and illustration. I find the view of reducing feed forward neural networks to a simpler base module via directed graph homomorphism very refreshing and may have potential applications in other areas of deep learning theory outside of convergence analysis.

Theoretical results presented are general and quantitative. The paper establishes global convergence of gradient flow (in a particular mode of convergence that exists in literature) for a large class of universal approximators and establishes that the learning number (smallest width sizes such that the network can learn) is not too large. This is applicable to a wide range of feedforward architectures, including those with skip connections or attention/self-attention.

The random sparse lift construction is interesting in that it is explicit and only requires a low-loss starting architecture (that can be obtained from experiments). Although I understand this is a theory paper, it would still be interesting for future work to try and construct this sparse life empirically to see if there are any gains in performances. 

The assumptions are standard to the best of my knowledge.

### Weaknesses
Sparse networks are not very popular in practice and sparsity seems to be a very crucial part of the proof (to obtain fibration of the good smaller computational graphs in any larger computation graph). This is the main reason I'm hesitant to give higher overall score and contribution score. 

The proof technique seems very targeted to sparse computational graphs where each node does not have a large influence on other nodes and may require a very different way of thinking about deep learning, compared to fully-connected networks.

### Questions
I have not studied the proof in the appendix in detail so my apology if some of these are addressed in the appendix. 
- Do you have to maintain full support of the weight distribution throughout training (seeing that you have an assumption on initialization, similar to Nguyen and Pham, 2020)? If so, does sparsity of the network make maintaining full support harder than in the fully-connected case? 
- Do you think this result can be extended to classification loss (e.g. logistic, exponential loss)? If so, how do you compare your result to existing convergence results for these loss (for instance, Ji and Telgarsky’s 2020 ‘Directional convergence and alignment in deep learning’)
- It seems from Definition 4.2 that the sparsified graph would have bounded average degree. Is this level of sparsity tight?
- Small typo: Page 2, last paragraph, “S_0 = {(s_0, s_1) \in \mathcal{N}^2 …” should be \in \mathbb{N}^2
- Typo: In section 3, sometimes ‘Euclidean’ is written with a lower case ‘e’. 
- It may make things clearer to add interpretation of each item to Definition 3.3. In particular, I’m not sure what T does at first glance (and it’s only explained later on).
