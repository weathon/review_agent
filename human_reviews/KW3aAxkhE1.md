# TextBind: Multi-turn Interleaved Multimodal Instruction-following in the Wild

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Large language models with instruction-following abilities have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models show exceptional generalizability to tackle various real-world tasks through their natural language interfaces. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality exemplar data, which is often difficult to obtain. This challenge is further exacerbated when it comes to multimodal instruction following. We introduce TextBind, an almost annotation-free framework for empowering LLMs with multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities. Our approach requires only image-caption pairs and generates multi-turn multimodal instruction-response conversations from a language model. To accommodate interleaved image-text inputs and outputs, we devise MIM, a language model-centric architecture that seamlessly integrates image encoder and decoder models. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MIM trained on TextBind achieves impressive generation capability in multi-modal conversations  compared to recent baselines.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes a pipeline to automatically construct multi-turn multimodal conversation-like instruction tuning datasets for models to be trained and evaluated on. The pipeline first ensembles a group of images with similar targeted concepts and interleaves them with an LLM to construct a multimodal conversation. A post-refinement stage is performed to ensure the quality, with a golden seed set serving as the in-context candidate for the LLM generations.
The authors then propose an MIM training to incorporate the curated data, with representations from stable diffusion models, for augmenting LMs with the ability to interleave images between textual conversations.

### Strengths
- The proposed multimodal instruction curation pipeline is sound, and the steps are claimed to incorporate quality assurances.
- The proposed MIM method should suit a wider range of multimodal conversational tasks.
- The experiments are compared with some strong recent multimodal models on the instruction following regime. (Although at the point of review, GPT-4V is available.)

### Weaknesses
- Although I agree with the rationale behind relatively poor performance from TextBind to other frameworks on the existing benchmarks, the proposed data curation framework should be aimed at such a generality, and hence leaves a drawback here where it cannot deal with some lower-level vision tasks (which are still quite important). What I would like to see is, could the models (MIM here) benefit further from tuning on these low-level vision instructions too, and at least achieve an on-par performance with existing works. That would strengthen the work significantly.
- The criteria of the conversation might be too coarse and not informative. The criteria seems holistic but in Section 4 it is said per-turn utterance is inspected, too. How do they correlate?  Also, has the annotator agreement been computed and reported? How many are there and what are their relations to the research group?
- A study of training conversations for tuning against the model performance is needed to gauge the contribution of the data.

### Questions
- Any analysis on what kinds of conversion utterance is likely leading to an image, but failed to generate from the models, and vice versa?

### Summary
This paper introduces TEXTBIND, an almost annotation-free framework for empowering LLMs with multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities. It devises an automatic data generation method with image clustering and GPT-4 generation to obtain a new multi-turn interleaved multi-model instruction dataset. It devise MIM, to integrate image encoder and decoder models for both image-grounded text generation and image generation. Experiment shows the effectiveness of the method and new derived dataset.

### Strengths
1. It devises an almost annotation-free framework for empowering LLMs with multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities, and provides a multi-turn interleaved image-text dataset. 
2. It proposes a method to support both image-grounded dialogue generation and image generation, and the experiment validates the effectiveness of training on the provided dataset for multimodal instruction-following.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluation is mainly based on the derived TEXTBINDEVAL dataset, and also seems do damage to the results of the benchmark datasets. Besides, given the automatic text generation metrics such as BLEU, Rouge, it is hard to know on where the derived dataset and training helps. 
2. For the data collection procedure, clustering the image together and chat about the visually similar images may not be the real-world demands for multimodal instruction-following. 
3. Compared with other work about multimodal instruction-following, such as Otter[1], what is the advantage and difference of this method?

### Questions
1. For the data collection procedure, how to decide the number of images to chat in a conversation and where to insert the image input or response?
2. Where does the method improve for the common benchmarks or whether the author has tested its performance on other interleaved or in-context datasets such as MIMIC-IT [2]?

### Summary
This paper explores interleaved multimodal conversations with LLMs. The authors first construct a multimodal conversation instruction tuning dataset with text-only GPT-4 and image descriptions. Then, multi-turn interleaved multimodal (dubbed MIM) instruction tuning based on GILL is used to train the multimodal LLMs to learn which segment of text information should be used for diffusion model image synthesis (which also defines when to generate images). Experiments demonstrate promising results.

### Strengths
- The targeted problem of enabling multimodal LLMs to generate images for a multimodal multi-turn conversation is trending, interesting, and important. Great application potentials can be induced in both the research community and the industry.
- The proposed dataset would be very useful to the community if it is open-sourced. The construction involves human-in-the-loop refinement, which is good since the data from the internet is extremely noisy.

### Weaknesses
- **Major concern 1.** My first major concern lies in the novelty of the proposed textual exchange method for enabling LLMs to generate images. As far as I know, learning which segment of texts to use as the text inputs of text-to-image models was first proposed by Divter [1] (not cited or discussed). Divter proposes to learn the textural inputs by using a special token and constructed template. However, leveraging LLMs and diffusion models is different, but the contribution is still limited in this case. The authors are required to clarify the similarities and differences with Divter. On the other hand, using only textual conditions to generate images has its limitations when considering very long-context-based (e.g., interleaved documents) image generation or image-conditioned image generation (e.g., image2image translation, image edition, etc).
- **Major concern 2.** My second major concern lies in the experimental evaluations. i) In Table 3, more commonly used NLP benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, and WinoGrande should be conducted. In Table 5, what about the most commonly used metric FID results? In Table 6, I wonder about the zero-shot results of TextBind on VQAv2 and MM-Vet. ii) No ablation studies or in-depth discussions are presented. For example, what if no human-in-the-loop is used during dataset construction? What are the failure cases of TextBind, and why? What emerging properties could be explored by TextBind?
- **Technical contribution.** The proposed method is simple, but the technical contribution is limited. The proposed multimodal LLM architecture is mainly based on previous work GILL. The only difference is the textural information exchange method which is good but somewhat incremental. Besides, the topic-aware image sampling is quite similar to the dataset constructed by PALI-X [2]. PALI-X constructs its own interleaved dataset Episodic WebLI by grouping image-text pairs. 
- **Unclearly supported claims.** The authors claim that the current multimodal instruction tuning methods lead to limited performance in open-world scenarios. However, there is a lack of analysis of TextBind's superiority in it. Besides, annotation-free may be overclaimed since human-in-the-loop definitely requires non-trivial annotation efforts.

### Questions
- Why is the method called TextBind? Assuming the authors are trying to analog to ImageBind [3]. However, the core spirit of multimodal binding in the same embedding space as a modality-agnostic multimodal encoder is very different from this paper. I am quite confused about this. A name that better summarizes the work's idea is better than using one similar to an existing work while not very suitable.
- Will the curated dataset be released to the public?
- The dataset is constructed by using image descriptions with GPT-4, similar to LLaVA [4] and ChatCaptioner [5] (not cited). I wonder how is the hallucination problem of data and models in such progress since CLIP filtering can not guarantee the avoidance of such an issue. For example, can authors provide some failure cases of the dataset and test the model's hallucination capability? 
- Now we have GPT-4V, I am looking forward to the newly constructed dataset with GPT-4V (not required at this moment).
- Since Q-Former is used, which may compress the visual signals, I wonder about the OCR performance of TextBind. For example, zero-shot results on TextVQA?
- There are many concurrent works working in this direction. It would be good if these works were discussed in related work [6-10].
- Minor: When the abbreviation `MIM` first appears in the paper, there is no explanation of the meanings.

I am looking forward to the authors' response.

### Summary
The paper proposes TextBind, an almost automatic and scalable pipeline for collecting multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following data, and MIM, an augmented Large Language Model (LLM) with a visual encoder/decoder for supporting multimodal inputs and outputs. The MIM trained on the dataset constructed by TextBind shows a variety of visual reasoning or understanding capabilities in real-world tasks. The results of text response generation and image generation show the superiority of both the constructed dataset and the trained MIM. Overall, the quality of paper is quite good and the results are very promising.

### Strengths
+ The MIM seems to be the first, or at least one of the first adaptation approaches to support multimodal interleaved inputs and outputs.
+ The trained model shows superior multimodal instruction-following capabilities in real-world tasks.
+ The dataset constructed by TextBind as well as the small subset for evaluation, TextBindEval, would be very useful for future multimodal LLM research.
+ The novel collection process and the characteristics of the collected dataset are described in great detail.

### Weaknesses
- The paper has very good quality overall. However, it would be better to describe the architecture of MIM and the training process in more details. E.g., how is each training example constructed, that is, what is the input and the target for training the MIM model?

### Questions
- The collected datasets, training data and TextBindEval, would be very useful for future research. Please release them if possible.
