# The Generative AI Paradox: “What It Can Create, It May Not Understand”

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
The recent wave of generative AI has sparked unprecedented global attention, with both excitement and concern over potentially superhuman levels of artificial intelligence: models now take only seconds to produce outputs that would challenge or exceed the capabilities even of expert humans. At the same time, models still show basic errors in understanding that would not be expected even in non-expert humans. This presents us with an apparent paradox: how do we reconcile seemingly superhuman capabilities with the persistence of errors that few humans would make? In this work, we posit that this tension reflects a divergence in the configuration of intelligence in today's generative models relative to intelligence in humans. Specifically, we propose and test the **Generative AI Paradox** hypothesis: generative models, having been trained directly to reproduce expert-like outputs, acquire generative capabilities that are not contingent upon---and can therefore exceed---their ability to understand those same types of outputs. This contrasts with humans, for whom basic understanding almost always precedes the ability to
generate expert-level outputs. We test this hypothesis through controlled experiments analyzing generation vs.~understanding in generative models, across both language and image modalities. Our results show that although models can outperform humans in generation, they consistently fall short of human capabilities in measures of understanding, as well as weaker correlation between generation and understanding performance, and more brittleness to adversarial inputs. Our findings support the hypothesis that models' generative capability may not be contingent upon understanding capability, and call for caution in interpreting artificial intelligence by analogy to human intelligence.

### Summary
Foundation models are growing increasingly powerful. However, their behaviour can be perplexing: often, it seems their ability to generate compelling outputs exceeds their ability to understand their own outputs. These authors put a name to this phenomenon: “the Generative AI Paradox.” The authors attempt to explore dimensions of this phenomenon by comparing human and model performance across two modalities (language and vision).

### Strengths
The motivation for the paper is superb. The authors do an excellent job introducing this paradox and it is nice that they put a name to the phenomenon. I am glad to see the authors studying this behaviour. In that sense, the conceptual underpinnings of the paper hold value for the broader ML community. 

Further, I believe that the LLM results are especially compelling. Figure 2 is a nice empirical demonstration of the Paradox. In fact, I was particularly interested in Figure 10 in the Appendix; it is interesting what factors lead human raters to prefer GPT responses over humans. I’d encourage the others to move these findings up to the main text.

### Weaknesses
While I admire the authors’ motivation and their language-centric experiments, I believe that the results for the vision domain are fundamentally flawed. The Paradox hypothesis that the authors raise in Hyp 1 refers to the **same model** being equivalent in generative performance but worse in discriminative performance relative to humans; therefore, I think it is not experimentally sound to have **different** vision models for understanding vs. generation. An adequate investigation into the hypothesis requires having the same model (like the authors did in the language task; e.g., GPT tested on generative and discriminative tasks) rather than one model for generative and (more than one, but different) for discriminative. This discrepancy, I believe, invalidates any of the vision domain results. 

However, I do not think that this weakness is fatal. I would encourage the authors to focus just on the language domain, unless they procure a vision (or language+vision?) model for which they can study generative and discriminative performance jointly in the same system. If the authors instead focus on just language, I would encourage them to move Fig 10 to the main text (per my note above). At this time, such a chance would be quite major, so I unfortunately recommend rejecting the work. Though, I think the core idea of this paradox, and the language results, warrant further study. 

A smaller weakness: the authors are perhaps a bit too flippant about the use of the word “understanding” and “intelligence” from a human cognition perspective. I encourage the authors to look into Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences in particular. This weakness pales in comparison though to the urgency and weight of the first weakness raised.

More details on the human data used are needed as well (see below).

### Questions
- What data was used for human generations in the language domain? This was not clearly spelled out from my reading? Did you use the language data from the benchmarks discussed? If so, please provide more details.  
- What version of GPT-4 did the authors use? The March 14 version? The “live” API instance? If the latter, were results conducted all in the same time window? Otherwise, I would worry about a silent update possibly impacting the discrepancy. 
- Can you please provide further details on how participant agreement was calculated? Pairwise in what sense? You reference “kappa” in the Appendix footnote… is this Cohen’s Kappa? Can you provide more details on the skew noted? 
- Minor note which did not impact my score: I would encourage the authors to break Section 2.1 and 2.2 into their own full sections (2 and 3, respectively).

### Summary
This work identifies and investigates the "Generative AI Paradox", where generative models (language and vision) can create outputs equal to (or beyond) that of human experts but do not understand said outputs. The underlying notion is that generation for humans is dependent on understanding (as a prerequisite for expert-level outputs), but the same is not true for generative AI. The hypothesis is tested through an assessment of generative abilities and understanding abilities (split into selective and interrogative settings), for both the language and vision domains. Results show gen. AI outperforms humans on generative tasks but underperform on understanding. The work goes on to discuss the possible reasons for this paradox occurring.

### Strengths
**Originality**  
O1. The work demonstrates novelty through the formalisation of hypotheses to capture the paradox.  
O2. Through evaluation with human participants, novel and concrete findings are established to test the proposed hypotheses.

**Quality**  
Q1. Evaluation is conducted using several models and datasets for both the vision and language domains.  
Q2. Thorough analysis shows support for the hypothesis, with a strong accompanying discussion.  

**Clarity**  
C1. Work is well presented and figures aid understanding.  
C2. Additional results and further discussions are provided in the Appendix.   
C3. Paper is easy to follow w.r.t to introducing the paradox, formalising it, presenting results, and then discussing findings.  

**Significance**  
S1. Further studies beyond initial hypothesis testing reveal additional results, such as human discrimination being more robust to challenging inputs.  
S2. Some discussion of potential explanations as to why the paradox occurs, e.g. gen. AI trained on generative learning objective - understanding is only encouraged if it furthers this goal (a divergence from human learning).

### Weaknesses
**Clarity**  
C1. Additional diagrams showing the steps in experiments would aid understanding. This would help highlight the difference between the experiments in Sections 3 and 4, where (from my understanding) the former uses existing candidates to evaluate discriminative understanding, and the latter uses generated outputs. Showing exactly where in the experimental process generative outputs vs existing data are used would be informative. Figure 1 doesn't quite capture the difference between the two cases in my opinion.  
C2. For the discriminative vs generative subplot in Figure 2, it is difficult to see all of the blue points for GPT4. Adjusting the plot to use alpha values would allow these points to be seen and strengthen the claims supported by the plot. Similar for Figure 8 in the appendix.  
C3. A handful of concrete outputs would provide further contextualisation for the kind of errors the models are making, as well as give further clarity to the structure of experiments. Figure 1 provides some examples, but additional outputs would be beneficial. Figures 12 to 15 help with this, but the questions/outputs are the same as used in Figure 1.  

**Significance**  
S1. While the discussion touches on possible explanations for the paradox, it does not mention ways it could be mitigated.  
S2. The end of the abstract states "Our findings... call for caution in interpreting artificial intelligence by analogy to human intelligence". This is briefly discussed under broader implications in Section 7, but I think the findings warrant a more detailed discussion of this outcome and how the results should be used in future work.

### Questions
1. In relation to the S1 weakness above, are the authors able to suggest any ideas about how the paradox could be overcome? Potential explanations are provided, but how does understanding the paradox enable improved development and a reduction of the disparity between generation and understanding?
2. The authors note that Figure 2 shows sub-hypothesis 1 is supported for at least one model in 10/13 datasets. Do you have an understanding of why experiments on the other three datasets do not support it?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces "the generative AI paradox," highlighting the disparity between generative models and humans, where the former excels in generation but lags in understanding. It substantiates this paradox through extensive experimentation, providing in-depth explanations for the observed phenomena. While "the generative AI paradox" resonates with the preconceived beliefs of many researchers, the paper uniquely confirms its validity, offers insightful explanations, and outlines potential avenues for future research, all of which serve as a significant source of inspiration for the broader community.

### Strengths
- The generative AI paradox is aligned with the intuitions of researchers, and is important to the community;
- The conducted experiments are comprehensive.
- This paper provides some future directions to explore.

### Weaknesses
- The insights presented in this paper may not be particularly surprising to the research community.
- (Please correct me if I've overlooked any details) The paper employs two metrics, selective and interrogative, to assess the understanding capability of generative models. However, it doesn't delve into which metric more accurately reflects the models' comprehension, nor does it discuss how each metric contributes to specific aspects of understanding. Additionally, a comparative analysis between the selective and interrogative abilities of the generative models is missing.
- The presentation, particularly the figures, requires further enhancement. Currently, they encapsulate extensive results without a clear presentation way, which somewhat complicates comprehension.

### Questions
- Could the authors explain which metric more accurately reflects the models' comprehension, nor how each metric contributes to specific aspects of understanding?
- Could the authors provide a comparative analysis of the generative models' selective and interrogative capabilities, and provide explanations for the observed results?
- The authors should consider enhancing the clarity and organization of the figures to improve the overall presentation.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors seek to study "understanding" in generative models. They conducted several experiments to examine the performance of generative models in both language and image domains in terms of generation vs understanding. It was found that the models surpassed human capabilities in generation tasks as already known but it was found that they consistently under-performed when it comes to understanding.

### Strengths
The work is timely, well written and significant for a large section of the conference's audience. 
While it is a common observation that generative models seem to struggle with discrimination, this work studies it in a principled way while additionally collecting human data. 
The work attempts to be complete as it covers a range of tasks, state of the art models and two modalities.

### Weaknesses
* The models tested were trained/finetuned for generation tasks. It is unclear if finetuning for discrimination will fix some issues if not all i.e does the performance drop come from not "understanding" or not from being familiar with discrimination tasks.

### Questions
* Did you collect any data which would reveal as to whether the participants can themselves figure if the models don't have understanding? That is, if you let participants interact (perhaps on a task where they need to collaborate) with the model (they are not told that it is a model), what percentage will complain that the model does not understand what it is outputting?
