## Abstract
Denoising diffusions are a powerful method to generate approximate samples from high-dimensional data distributions. Recent results provide polynomial bounds on their convergence rate, assuming $L^2$-accurate scores. Until now, the tightest bounds were either superlinear in the data dimension or required strong smoothness assumptions. We provide the first convergence bounds which are linear in the data dimension (up to logarithmic factors) assuming only finite second moments of the data distribution. We show that diffusion models require at most $\tilde O(\frac{d \log^2(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ steps to approximate an arbitrary distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ to within $\varepsilon^2$ in KL divergence. Our proof extends the Girsanov-based methods of previous works. We introduce a refined treatment of the error from discretizing the reverse SDE inspired by stochastic localization.

### Summary
The manuscript studies denoising diffusion models and specifically their convergence in KL to the "ground truth" distribution in the absence of smoothness assumptions on the ground truth distribution. The authors revisit the analysis of Chen et al. 2023a/b and improve upon it in terms of dimensional dependence (from $d^2$ to $d$, which is further argued to now be optimal). This improvement stems from a refined discretization analysis using ideas from the stochastic localization literature.

### Strengths
- The paper offers a rather satisfactory improvement on previous analyses of denoising by shaving of a dimensional factor (or alternatively removing extraneous assumptions such as bdd/lip etc.). 

- The problem is quite clearly of interest to the community and the solution offered is also quite elegant in the way it draws on the stochastic localization literature. 

- Overall, the paper is well-structured and the quality of writing is generally good. There are some caveats here that I detail below but this is nothing that cannot be adressed by a round of further proof-reading. Although I did not check the appendix in sufficient detail to vouch for correctness, I think their math is generally OK to follow.

- In terms of originality, the authors observe that Conforti et al. have produced a similar result in a parallell submission. I don't see this as an issue for publishing this manuscript at ICLR. I think it is safe to say that these have been developed in parallell and given the different techniques used they are both independently of each other of interest to the community---in my view the ideas herein are fairly original and interesting.

### Weaknesses
My feeling is that this is a solid piece of technical work and I did not find many weaknesses. I do have a few remarks on writing though:

- The notation is a little messy throughout and feels somewhat rushed/needs further proofreading. There are quite a few undefined/implicitly defined objects. Let me give a few examples:

    -  Previous to stating the main theorem, the main object of interest $p_{t_N}$ has never been defined. 
    - The use of bold $\mathbf{x}$  for realization when defining conditional objects is a little confusing when at the same time $\mathbf{x}_*$ is a random variable. This is also in conflict with the use in equation 3 where $\mathbf{x}_t$ is a random variable drawn from $q_t$. It would be helpful if there was a consistent distinction between realization and random object throughout and if this were defined early in the manuscript.
   -  The notation for conditional expectation given the observation (function $\mathbf{a}$)  following eqn 6 is unnecessarily dense. In particular, that the LHS depends on $U_s$ whereas the RHS depends on $\mu_s$ is a little confusing at first glance. It would be good if the authors were a little more parsimonious and consistent in their notation---at least when introducing objects for the first time.


*Other comments*:


- Following Lemma 1 it would not hurt to expound a little on the significance of the covariance matrix and why it will be useful in the sequel. It would be nice if some version of what is stated "inside" the proof of thm 1, second paragraph, appears near this lemma.

- Above equation (9) there is an extraneous square in the definition of the Frobenius norm (and the square root should probably be outside of the trace)

### Questions
With regard to the second of part of assumption 2---you mention that your analysis is not dependent on "it"---I have clarifying question: would the result incur extra "condition numbers" or does it still work even if this covariance matrix has 0 or near 0 eigenvalues?

Could you expand on the steps taken in equation (9)? I do not immediately see how this follows from the standard Ito Isometry relating squares of stochastic integrals and integrals of their squares.

Following the statement of proposition 4 could you be a little more precise/remind us about which stochastic transformation is used in the invokation of the data-processing inequality? It seems like it is here the early stopping idea is used but I find it hard to follow.

### Summary
This paper studies sampling from a data distribution on R^d using denoising diffusion. 
The main result is an improved convergence rate under only a second moment assumption on the data distribution. 
This bound improves the dependence of rate on d from quadratic in Chen et al. to nearly linear. 
Other parameter dependencies are the same as in Chen et al.

### Strengths
This paper is pretty well-written. 
The punchline is clearly addressed within the first 3 pages. 
The key technique that makes the rate improvement possible is a differential inequality for one of the error terms, instead of using Lipschitz bounds which apparently require additional model assumptions. 
I particularly appreciate it that the authors make it clear what is novel in their contribution and what has been well-established in the literature. 
In the latter case, proper references are given.

### Weaknesses
I don't see obvious technical weaknesses. 
Here are two suggestions.

1. Though this is a purely theoretical paper, given how successful diffusion model is in practice, it might add some value to show some experimental results even for very simple data distribution. 

2. Several auxiliary results are known in the literature or can be adapted from known results in a straightforward way. However, proofs for many of these results are still given in the appendix. I understand the intention to increase readability. However, according to my personal taste it feels that there's some room to streamline the proof and make the paper more succinct. To clarify, this is a matter of presentation and either way does not affect my evaluation of the result.

### Questions
1. I encourage the authors to add "nearly linear" in the title. This is a standard terminology (at least in theoretical computer science) for hiding log factors. 

2. One dumb question: doesn't the second part of Assumption 2 imply its first part? Or am I mis-interpreting the meaning of second moment of a distribution on R^d?

3. It is claimed that the isotropic condition in Assumption 2 is not essential. However, this has never been formally justified, if I'm not missing it. Which nuisance of the proof needs to be changed if the covariance is general? In fact, I have some doubt on the claim that this assumption is immaterial. What if the covariance is not strictly positive definite? What if the covariance is **unknown**?

4. In the line following equation (9), there seems to be some typos in the equations for verifying the applicability of Fubini. 

5. Right before the statement of Lemma 6, it's claimed that the existence of t_M = T-1 is WLOG. This is likely technical but I suggest briefly justify it. I guess if this does not hold, a tiny approximation error needs to be introduced.

6. Please introduce the notation $\lesssim$ somewhere if it's not been done yet. I assume that this means the LHS is upper bounded by the RHS multiplied by a numerical constant. 

7. It's argued informally in section 4 (with some details in appendix G) that the linear dependence of the convergence rate on d is necessary. 
This seems like a nice observation. Is it possible to turn it into a formal proposition and specify how this lower bound depends on other parameters besides d? In fact, this observation is a little surprising to me since for product distribution, the problem is effectively 1-dimensional however denoising diffusion still incurs a dimension-dependence. Could the authors offer some more intuition? Thanks in advance.

### Summary
Many current state-of-the-art generative models are denoising diffusion models. These models take samples from a data distribution, run them through a forward SDE, which progressively adds Gaussian noise to the samples, and then seek to learn the reverse SDE using neural networks. This paper seeks to prove mixing bounds for the reverse diffusion process after the denoising score model has been learned. In particular, under the assumptions of a learned score function with an L2 error bound and a data distribution with identity covariance, the authors use the theory of stochastic localization to yield a bound on the KL divergence between the generated samples and the data distribution. This bound those that the number of iterates to reach error $\epsilon$ scales linearly in $d$, quadratically in the forward time $T$, and $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ with respect to $\epsilon$.

### Strengths
- This work tackles a highly relevant problem on the convergence of denoising diffusion models. 
- The bound given scales linearly in the dimension, which seems optimal in the worst case, as the authors point out in the appendix.
- The bound given accounts for a realistic setting, where the chain has early stopping, approximate initialization, and discrete reverse time discretization.
- The bound brings new theoretical tools of stochastic localization, which should be more broadly attractive to the community working on diffusion models.
- The authors explain the proof in detail in the paper.

### Weaknesses
- There are no simulations or experiments to support the results. However, this is a smaller weakness since the work is primarily theoretical.
- I wish that there was more discussion of the key lemma. Why is stochastic localization needed to prove it? How can we interpret it?
- I have some issues with the presentation of the main theorem in the paper. This is important since about a third of the paper is dedicated to explaining the proof of Theorem 1. I found their explanation to be hard to follow. First, I would appreciate a roadmap explaining precisely what steps are new/novel and what steps are guided by past work. In particular, it seems that the work on the discretization error is new, so the authors are then able to apply the bound from stochastic localization. However, is the perspective taken where they view the single process $(Y_t)$ as solutions to (2) and (4) under different measures new? The biggest issue, though, in my opinion, is that much of the proof is left to the appendix. I understand this is necessary, but without more interpretation in the paper to help the reader understand what is happening, it is easy to get lost. Improving this explanation would greatly help the paper since it is primarily theoretical. Some suggestions are the following.

Setup
- More clearly define the measures $P^{\cdot}$ and $Q$, and explain how $(Y_t)$ is a solution to (2) and (4) under these measures.
Bound on the discretization error
- An initial lemma saying the final bound for this section so that the reader can put into context the computations being done. Then, put Lemmas 2-6 into context for how they help with the final bound as they are discussed.
Girasanov
- Again, state the final bound as a lemma so that the discussion can be put into context. This can then be pointed to throughout.

### Questions
- While the linear dependence in the dimension is expected in the worst case, does the analysis of this paper and similar ones point toward dimension-independent rates under further assumptions on the score? Or is this a limitation of the Langevin diffusion? Could other processes help to alleviate this?

### Summary
The paper gives a new sampling error bound for diffusion models. Roughly speaking, a diffusion model is a method for sampling from a data distribution $q_0$ that "works" whenever one can approximate the scores $\nabla q_t(\cdot)$ well, where $q_t$ is the density of a particle undergoing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics from $q_0$. Usually, score approximations would be found with deep neural networks. 

Previous results by other authors obtained bounds relating the quality of score approximations to the distance between $q_0$ and the distribution output by the diffusion model. The present paper gives improved bounds: the main difference is that the error in approximating scores is not multiplied by any time- or -dimension dependent factors, but only by a universal constant.   The proof of this result follows the outline of previous work by Chen, Lee and Lu; the main modification (according to the authors) is in dealing with discretization errors.is

### Strengths
The bound is an improvement over previous results that is quite natural. Proof techniques are elegant.

### Weaknesses
The main proof outline is not too novel. The condition on the final step sizes is not very natural.

### Questions
Can you give me a better sense on where the restrictions on the discretization come from?

### Summary
The paper improves the analysis for diffusion models, primarily in the setting without uniform smoothness of $\log p_t$. In this setting, it improves the dependence on time discretization (under an $\epsilon^2$ close score matching estimator) from $d^2$ to $d$, by analogy with techniques in stochastic localization.

### Strengths
The tight rate in dimension is genuinely novel, and the setting where $\log p_t$ is not uniformly smooth is arguably the more important regime.

The incorporation of stochastic localization techniques, seen also in Montanari (2023) and other works, is quite elegant and possibly suggests additional improvements. See questions.

### Weaknesses
The main contributions of this work are somewhat narrow, found primarily Lemmas 2, 4, 5, 6, which in my opinion are algebraic consequences of insights developed in prior work. For instance, the original perspective of diffusion models as stochastic localizers comes from Montanari, and the key lemmas used in analyzing stochastic localization are from Montanari (2023) and some of Eldan’s works. The score-matching error and OU error are handled by prior work on diffusion models, from Chen et al.

Consequently, the paper could benefit from additional results, see my questions below.

Despite this, the improvement in rate made by this paper is quite significant and definitely merits publication. Consequently, I am voting for acceptance.

### Questions
Have the authors attempted to apply such techniques to other families of diffusion models, beyond those using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward flow? For instance those found in later work by Chen et al. [1]
 
[1] Chen, Sitan, Giannis Daras, and Alex Dimakis. "Restoration-degradation beyond linear diffusions: A non-asymptotic analysis for ddim-type samplers." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.

Below are some minor corrections/questions:
Frobenius norm squared should be just Tr(A^\top A) (page 6)
Girsanov’s Theorem is given with the condition that $b_t$ is “previsible”, but I am not too clear on what previsible means in this context (it is not given in Le Gall). The standard statement is just that $b_t$ is an adapted process satisfying Novikov’s condition.

### Summary
The paper provides bounds on the number of steps of the discretized SDE in diffusion models required to approximate a general distribution with finite second moments upto a certain accuracy. The central novelty of the paper's analysis is the incorporation of the decay of the expected covariance of the denoising posterior measure during the process of the sampling. The rate of the decay is obtained through results in the stochastic localization literature, which is subsequently combined with the existing analysis based on Girsanov's theorem. The analysis leads to an improved dependence of the iteration-complexity on the input dimension in the absence of a uniform-Lipschitz assumption on the score function.

### Strengths
- Theoretical analysis of diffusion models is an active area with several open problems. 
- The contribution to the proof technique, albeit straightforward, could be useful for downstream theoretical analysis of aspects such as sample and computational complexity, as well as for proofs related to algorithmic stochastic localization in spin-glass models.
- The paper is well written.
- The proofs are easy to follow and largely self-contained.
- The paper adequetely acknowledges the inspiration from the stochastic localization literature towards obtaining the bounds, even though the bounds can be obtained directly using Itô calculus. This helps the reader appreciate the connection with stochastic localization and the motivation behind the results.

### Weaknesses
- Majority of the proof closely follows the analysis of Chen et al. (2023a;d).
- The paper improves upon best existing bounds in the absence of uniform-Lipschitzness of the score function. However, more explanation is required to understand why Lipschitzness is a limiting assumption.  For instance, while for discrete measures it is apparent that one must resort to early stopping on a corrupted version of the distribution, it requires further justification for measures absolutely continuous w.r.t the Lebesgue measure. Futhermore, the proofs in the algorithmic stochastic localization works such as El Alaoui et al. (2022), themselves rely on the Lipschitzness of the estimated score function. 
- Assumption 1 of approximating the score to arbitrary error, while utilized in existing works, is unrealistic for several setups. For instance, some recent works have highlighted statistical and computational barriers towards the estimation of the score function, in particular the works El Alaoui et al., 2022; Montanari & Wu, 2023, as well as:

   Biroli, G., & Mézard, M. (2023). Generative diffusion in very large dimensions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.03518.

   perspective. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.14085.

   A discussion of the limitations of assumption 1 would strengthen the paper.

### Questions
## Questions
- For what classes of distributions is the uniform Lipshitzness assumption restrictive? What iteration complexity could one expect under smoothness assumptions non-uniform in time?
- In Lemma 5, the covariance bound in Lemma 1 is utilized to bound the expected Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the score function. Can this be interpreted as establishing an average-Lipschitzness of the score function?
- Are deterministic sampling schemes expected to yield identical iteration complexities?

## Suggestions
- In the title, it should be clarified that "linear convergence" refers to being linear in the input dimension, to avoid confusion with the use of the term "linear convergence" in the optimization literature.
- To improve clarity, one could clarify that the SDE in Eq. 6 and the noisy observation process in Eq. 5 are equivalent only in law.
- I suggest mentioning in sections 1.1 and 1.2 how the posterior means are related to the score function.
