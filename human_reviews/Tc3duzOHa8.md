- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) input samples at the time of inference is a key element in the trustworthy deployment of intelligent models. While there has been tremendous improvement in various variants of OOD detection in recent years, detection performance under adversarial settings lags far behind the performance in the standard setting. In order to bridge this gap, we introduce RODEO in this paper, a data-centric approach that generates effective outliers for robust OOD detection. More specifically, we first show that targeting the classification of adversarially perturbed in- and out-of-distribution samples through outlier exposure (OE) could be an effective strategy for the mentioned purpose, as long as the training outliers meet certain quality standards. We hypothesize that the outliers in the OE should possess several characteristics simultaneously to be effective in the adversarial training: diversity, and both conceptual differentiability and analogy to the inliers. These aspects seem to play a more critical role in the adversarial setup compared to the standard training. Next, we propose an adaptive OE method to generate near and diverse outliers by incorporating both text and image domain information. This process helps satisfy the mentioned criteria for the generated outliers and significantly enhances the performance of the OE technique, particularly in adversarial settings. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness across various detection setups, such as novelty detection (ND), Open-Set Recognition (OSR), and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of our approach with other OE techniques in adversarial settings to showcase its effectiveness.

### Summary
This paper studies the challenging problem -- out-of-distribution detection under adversarial attacks. It proposes a novel method RODEO to improve the quality of outlier exposures by generating diverse and near-distribution OOD synthetic samples through leveraging text descriptions of the potential OOD concepts and guiding diffusion model using these texts. The synthetic samples are utilized as OE during the adversarial training of a discriminator. It performs extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in the highly challenging task of Robust Novelty Detection. The proposed method maintains high OOD detection performance in both standard and adversarial settings across various detection scenarios, including medical and industrial datasets, demonstrating its high applicability in real-world contexts.

### Strengths
I think this paper has the following strengths: 

1. The idea of using a pre-trained generative diffusion model and combining it with a CLIP model to generate near-distribution outlier data is novel. The results also show that it is effective in improving robust OOD detection performance. 

2. The proposed method RODEO achieves significant results on various datasets, including medical and tiny datasets, highlighting the applicability of the work to real-world applications. 

3. The proposed RODEO is adaptable to various outlier detection setups, such as ND, OSR, and OOD detection. The method achieves competitive results in clean settings and establishes a SOTA performance in adversarial settings, surpassing existing methods by up to 50% in terms of AUROC.

### Weaknesses
I think this paper has the following weaknesses: 

1. The setup for theoretical analysis is too simple. It assumes the normal class follows $U(0, a-\epsilon)$ and the anomaly class adheres to $U(a+\epsilon, b)$. However, in practical datasets, the normal class distribution and the anomaly class distribution are much more complicated. It is unclear whether the conclusions drawn from the simple setup still hold for other distributions (or practical datasets). I think the authors can first consider Gaussian distributions to see if the analysis and conclusions still hold. 

2. The comparisons with the baselines may not be fair. The proposed method uses a generative diffusion model and a CLIP model, which are pre-trained on millions of data. However, some of the baselines (e.g., ATOM and ALOE) considered in the experiments don't use such extra data for training. Thus, the comparisons may not be fair. It is known that using extra data can significantly improve the model's performance. 

3. The PGD attack used is weak. The authors should use a PGD attack with multiple random restarts (e.g., 10 restarts) and more attack iterations (e.g., 1000 steps). Although it uses the strong attack AutoAttack, it doesn't explain how it adapts the AutoAttack to its settings. Since AutoAttack is not designed to attack OOD detectors, it cannot be directly used to attack OOD detectors. Besides, in Tables 2 and 3, the results for AutoAttack are missing.

### Questions
1. Could the authors explain whether the theoretical analysis holds for more complex data distributions? 

2. Could the authors explain whether the comparisons with the baselines are fair or not? 

3. Could the authors explain how they use AutoAttack for evaluation?

### Summary
- Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during inference is critical for model reliability. However, OOD detection performance degrades significantly under adversarial attacks. 
- The paper proposes a data-centric approach called RODEO to improve adversarial robustness of OOD detection by generating effective outliers. 
- Key ideas:
(1) Adversarial OOD detection benefits from outliers that are diverse, near the in-distribution data, and conceptually distinct from inliers.  
(2) Propose adaptive outlier generation method incorporating text and image information to satisfy above criteria. Uses text encoder to find near-OOD words, CLIP model to guide image generation, and filtering.
(3) Adversarially train classifier on inliers and generated outliers. Use classifier's OOD logit as anomaly score at test time.
- Experiments across novelty detection, open-set recognition and OOD detection show RODEO outperforms under adversarial settings.

### Strengths
Originality:
- The concept of generating "near-distribution" outliers that are diverse and conceptually different from the inliers is a unique contribution to the field.
- Creative use of CLIP.

Quality:
- Comprehensive experiments across novelty detection, open-set recognition and OOD detection highlighting broad applicability.
- Strong results surpassing prior work by good margins, especially under adversarial attacks. 
- Ablation studies analyzing impact of different outlier generation techniques.
- The paper also provides a detailed theoretical justification for the use of near-distribution outliers.

Clarity:  
- Clearly explains and motivates the need for adaptive outlier generation for robustness.

Significance:
- The paper addresses an important problem in machine learning, which is the detection of OOD samples, particularly under adversarial conditions. The proposed method shows significant improvements over existing methods in various detection setups, making it potentially valuable in applications that require robust OOD detection.

### Weaknesses
The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with other methods of OOD detection, especially those that also use a data-centric approach or those that have been designed specifically for adversarial settings. This could help to place the proposed method in a broader context and demonstrate its advantages and disadvantages more clearly. 

The method involves several complex steps, including the generation of outliers and their incorporation into the training process, which might be computationally expensive. The paper has not yet provide a discussion on the trade-off between the performance gain and the added computational cost.

The paper could provide more details on the performance of the method in non-adversarial settings, and it could compare the method with a wider range of existing methods.

### Questions
- The paper assumes that effective outliers should be 'near-distribution', 'diverse', and 'conceptually differentiable' from the inliers. While this makes sense in theory, it may not hold in all practical scenarios. There could be situations where effective outliers do not meet all these criteria, and it would be interesting to see how the proposed method would perform in such cases.

- The approach is only evaluated on computer vision tasks and datasets. Would be interesting to see applicability to other modalities.

### Summary
The authors propose adversarial training on synthetic outliers generated by DDPM in order to build a better ND, OSR, and OOD detection model. The key idea is that synthetic outliers must be diverse and near-distribution. To find those, they use DDPM with CLIP guidance with respect to  the nearest neighbors of a label in Word2Vec space (up to a threshold to avoid picking equivalent labels). To keep outliers visually similar, they initialize the diffusion process from an in-distribution image. In experiments, the authors show that the proposed method outperforms approaches like ALOE and APAE.

### Strengths
Originality
========
* The idea of guiding DDPM with CLIP embeddings of concepts that are close to in-distribution labels in order to create outliers is novel and interesting.
* I found the idea of using negative adjectives also interesting.

Quality
=====
* The proposed method is sound in general and builds on existing and proven approaches like ALOE.
* The authors provide simplified (1d) theoretical insights on why their method works.
* Ablation studies are provided.

Clarity
=====
* I liked the effort made by the authors to provide some intuition on why their method works (e.g. t-SNE in Figure 4).

Significance
=========
* The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement.

### Weaknesses
Originality
=======
* Generating images with CLIP guidance could be seen like having an additional dataset (the one used to train CLIP) from where outliers are searched. This could be unfair with respect to approaches that do not have access to additional data.
* In fact, CLIP alone has been shown to be good at OOD detection [A] (not discussed in the submission)

Quality
=====
* The authors do not describe the limitations of their work, e.g. what happens if the OOD class is also OOD for clip and the diffusion model?
* Does the 1d analysis hold in higher dimensions?

Clarity
=====
* What is $c$ in e.g., $\mu(x_t|c)$?
* In the Appendix, $\tau$ is defined differently than in page 6 (equation numbers missing). Is there any reason for that?

Minor

* "optimizer and PGD-10": PGD is an optimizer too, which causes confusion
* Page 15: an extra labels.
* "The generation process should incorporate the normal distribution": although this is not a typo, when I read it for first time I understood normal meant $\mathcal{N}$ and not in-distribution.

### Summary
This paper argues that both near and diverse outliers are useful to enhance robust outlier detection. Next, they propose an adaptive OE method to generate near and diverse outliers by incorporating both text and image domain information. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of this method.

### Strengths
1.	The experiment in this article is solid. This paper conducts a series of experiments across various detection setups, such as novelty detection (ND), Open-Set Recognition (OSR), and OOD detection.
2.	The idea has some novelty. This paper argues that near outliers can benefit the OOD detection, and generates near and diverse outliers to train OOD detection, which sounds interesting.

### Weaknesses
1.	The theoretical insights of this article lack effective support. In the theoretical insights section, the schematic diagram of this article is  intuitive. However, this article lacks a further explanation of the theory, which makes it appear less convincing. I recommend the author to conduct a more detailed theoretical derivation. 

2.	The explanation of Figure 1 is confusing. I am confusing about the explanation about “This suggests that an OE dataset closer to the normal dataset distribution is significantly more beneficial than a distant one.” Does this mean that the samples obtained from previous adversarial training are not effective? The author needs a more detailed explanation here.

3.	When the author explained that near and reverse outliers can enhance the model's OOD detection performance, I was curious about the performance of those distance outliers, which is also a critical part in OOD. (e.g., Gaussian Noise claimed in Fig. 1.)
