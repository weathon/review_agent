## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) problems where the learner attempts to infer an unobserved reward from some feedback variables have been studied in several recent papers. The setting of *Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL)* is an example of such feedback-based reinforcement learning tasks where the learner optimizes the return by inferring latent binary rewards from the interaction with the environment. In the IGL setting, a relevant assumption used in the RL literature is that the feedback variable $Y$ is conditionally independent of the context-action $(X,A)$ given the latent reward $R$. In this work, we propose *Variational Information-based IGL (VI-IGL)* as an information-theoretic method to enforce the conditional independence assumption in the IGL-based RL problem. The VI-IGL framework learns a reward decoder using an information-based objective based on the conditional mutual information (MI) between the context-action $(X,A)$ and the feedback variable $Y$ observed from the environment. To estimate and optimize the information-based terms for the continuous random variables in the RL problem, VI-IGL leverages the variational representation of mutual information and results in a min-max optimization problem. Furthermore, we extend the VI-IGL framework to general $f$-Information measures in the information theory literature, leading to the generalized $f$-VI-IGL framework to address the RL problem under the IGL condition. Finally, we provide the empirical results of applying the VI-IGL method to several reinforcement learning settings, which indicate an improved performance in comparison to the previous IGL-based RL algorithm.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel algorithm for the Interaction Grounded
Learning (IGL) problem based on an information theoretic
objective. The algorithm is shown to demonstrate superior performance
under several noise-corrupted adaptations of a standard benchmark
relative to the state of the art.

### Strengths
This paper presents a well-motivated algorithm for a relatively new
problem in ML. This algorithm addresses the challenge of dealing with
significant randomness in the feedback given to the learner, and the
empirical results confirm the benefits of the proposed
approach. Ablations are also given to provide more insight about which
parts of the algorithm had notable effects on performance.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses that I can imagine are with respect to the
organization of the paper. Perhaps I am biased, since I had not
previously been aware of the IGL framework, but I had trouble
understanding both the motivation behind the problem framework and the
algorithm. Given that IGL is a relatively new and unexplored topic, I
believe the paper can be improved by giving less abstract examples of
the IGL framework early on (for instance, everything became quite a
bit more clear to me once I saw the benchmark in the experimental
section).

Moreover, I did not find the argument for the necessity to include the
regularization term particularly convincing. I would have liked to
have seen stronger evidence (particularly before the regulization term
was introduced) to suggest that the mode of overfitting discussed in
the paper actually occurs. Notably, without the regularization term,
the algorithm/optimization problem is considerably simpler.
Having said that, since the algorithm still
appears to be novel even without the regularization term, I think this
is mostly an issue of organizing the content to improve clarity.

### Questions
Does the context distribution have to be fixed throughout training (or
can it, for example, be adversarial)?

I believe there is a mistake in the notation of $V(\pi)$, particularly
with $(x, a)\sim d_0\otimes\pi$. This looks like $x, a$ are sampled
independently, but really $a$ sampled conditionally on $x$. I believe
it should be more like $x\sim d_0,a\sim\pi(\cdot\mid x)$.

Admittedly I am not intimately familiar with MI optimization, but it
is not obvious to me why we should expect minimization of the standard
MI objective to "overfit" to maximize $I(Y; R_\psi)$ as you claim. I
see that the objective can be decreased by increasing this term, but I
see now reason why thi wouldn't be balanced by a decrease of the $I(Y;
X, A, R_\psi)$
term. Has this been demonstrated experimentally? If so, can you
provide citations? If this paper is the first demonstration of this
overfitting phenomenon, it might be nice to show those results
before defining the regularized objective, it would help motivate your approach.

Why is it that the experiments with $\beta=0$ exhibited the most
variance? In this case, I would expect variance to be lower, since
you're optimizing over fewer neural network parameters / the
optimization has one less level of nesting.

In Algorithm 1, what does "Ensure: Policy $\pi$" mean?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed to leverage information-theoretical quantities to solve the interaction grounded learning in the noisy scenarios. The main contribution of this paper is a new objective based on the mutual information. However, how to estimate the mutual information has been heavily studied in the literature, and I don’t see any new components here. Finally, the authors do not provide the appendix.

### Strengths
N/A.

### Weaknesses
* Although the intuition of such objective is sound, I don’t think there are any rigorous theoretical justification, e.g. the statistical error on estimating the reward with different level of noise.
* I believe the authors ignore large amounts of work on (conditional) mutual information estimation, that covers most of the theoretical derivation in the paper, e.g. [1][2].

* The authors do not provide the appendix, which should be a crucial issue that can lead to the rejection.

### Questions
To echo the weakness, I would like to ask:
* Is there any rigorous theoretical guarantee for motivating this objective?
* Can the authors discuss the relationship between the proposed estimation method and the existing work, not limited to the references I provide?

### Summary
this paper proposed an information-theoretical method for enforcing conditional independence between Context and A, given latent reward variable. The method is generalize to f -Information measures.

### Strengths
an interesting problem is considered. the Preliminaries section provided a good background.

### Weaknesses
many steps in the derivation / explanation are not explained. For example, in my option the quantity (without an equation number) after Eq (4) does not follow from Eq 4. Is Theorem 3 trivial that it does not require proof?

### Questions
Why is it important to show results for a few different f-divergences? 
Why were these f-divergences chosen? 
How to chose "f-divergences"? Table 2 show that different scenarios requires different "f-divergences".

### Summary
The paper discusses the challenges and solutions in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms when the agent lacks complete knowledge of the reward variable. When there is no explicit reward, the agent must infer the reward from observed feedback, increasing the computational and statistical complexity of the RL problem.

To address these challenges, the Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL) framework is introduced. In IGL, the agent observes a context, takes an action, and receives feedback, aiming to maximize the unobserved return by inferring rewards from this interaction. The key to this approach is a properly inferred reward decoder, which maps the context-action-feedback tuple to a prediction of the latent reward. However, learning such a reward decoder can be information-theoretically infeasible without additional assumptions on the relationship between context, action, feedback, and reward variables.

One such assumption, known as Full Conditional Independence, posits that feedback is conditionally independent of context and action given the latent reward. Existing IGL methods use this assumption and propose joint training of the policy and decoder. However, noisy feedback in real-world scenarios may challenge the validity of this assumption.

The paper introduces Variational Information-based IGL (VI-IGL) as an information-theoretic approach to IGL-based RL tasks. VI-IGL aims to ensure conditional independence between feedback and context action by minimizing an information-based objective function. It includes a regularization term to make the reward decoder robust to feedback noise.

The challenge of optimizing this objective is addressed by leveraging the variational representation of mutual information (MI) and formulating the problem as a min-max optimization. This allows gradient-based algorithms to efficiently solve it. The paper also extends the approach to f-Variational Information-based IGL (f-VI-IGL), creating a family of algorithms for the IGL-based RL problem.

Empirical results suggest that VI-IGL outperforms existing IGL RL algorithms, particularly in noisy feedback scenarios. The key contributions of the paper include the introduction of an information-theoretic approach to IGL-based RL, a novel optimization technique for handling continuous random variables, and the extension of the approach to f-VI-IGL.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a novel method to solve a real problem when we need to apply RL algorithms in real applications.

- The paper provides a clear context of what is already done in previous literature and what are the main challenges.

- The authors explain appropriately the novel method, providing the preliminary to understand the proposed approach. The novel algorithm uses a regularized information-based IGL objective. Then they provide a more tractable objective using the variational information-based approach. 

- The authors compare the proposed algorithm with SotA method, showing that the proposed approach outperforms previous ones when there is noise.

### Weaknesses
- The paper does not theoretically discuss how the changes in the (4) objective can lead to worse performances. How much the KL approximation optimum can be far from the original optimal solution?

- The paper is lacking theoretical results (e.g. sample complexity or regret analysis). Xie et al. provide a sample complexity result for their proposed algorithm. Could you derive similar results?

- Experimental evaluation: 

    - Why does the proposed method achieve worse results in the No noises setting compared to Xie et Al.?

- In the conclusion the authors mentioned that the algorithm is computationally expensive. Could you compare the computational complexity of the proposed method with the one of Xie et Al.?
