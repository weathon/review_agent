# CAMIL: Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Cancer Detection and Subtyping in Whole Slide Images

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
The visual examination of tissue biopsy sections is fundamental for cancer diagnosis, with pathologists analyzing sections at multiple magnifications to discern tumor cells and their subtypes. However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value. Our code is available at https://github.com/olgarithmics/ICLR_CAMIL.

### Summary
This paper proposes a multi-instance framework for WSI classification that incorporates the spatial context of patch instances into the architecture of the model via a combination of transformer and neighbor-constrained attention with constrastive learning. The input images are preprocessed into features using a model trained with self-supervised contrastive learning (SimCLR) on pathology images with an ImageNet-pre-trained ResNet18. The transformer module follows the NystroFormer architecture. The attention module is the main contribution of this paper and trains an feature-similarity-weighted adjacency matrix. Experiments are performed on two well-known pathology datasets (CAMELYon-16 and TCGA-NSCLC) for a binary classification task (cancer/non-cancer). SOTA accuracy and AUC are reported for both datasets. An ablation study examines the separate effects of the Nystroformer and the attention module, showing the attention module to provide the largest improvement.

### Strengths
* The main idea behind this paper (leveraging neighbor correlations among patches in a transformer framework) is substantiated by domain-grounded intuition.
* The chosen architecture appears to provide SOTA results on two well-known pathology benchmarks.
* The ablation study shows the strong effect of the neighbor attention module.

### Weaknesses
* The number of datasets used for benchmarking is too small (2). [update: the authors have added the C17 dataset]

* The paper does not discuss data augmentation within MIL training. Several recent papers have explorer ways to inflate the number of bags in MIL with various augmentation scheme.

* The ablation study lacks an experiment showing the contribution of the pathology-specific self-supervised feature-extraction module. It would be easy to compare to a straight imagenet-pretrained ResNet18. [update: the authors have added an ablation study as requested][

### Questions
* The published TransMIL accuracy numbers for CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC are: (ACC=0.8837, ACC=0.8835). The paper cites: 0.905 and 0.905. I did not verify the other numbers, but please double-check. [update: this question has been answered - the papers uses different feature extractors SimCLR]

Overall, this is a solid paper implementing a grounded intuition using a MIL framework and demonstrating SOTA results.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper propose a new method for multiple-instance learning. The main novelty is the idea of adjusting the attention score using surrounding context (neighbor tiles). The proposed method achieved improved performance on two datasets.

### Strengths
I appreciate the concept of incorporating contextual information to enhance the performance of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). In particular, the intuition that 'tiles with high attention scores, surrounded by other high-scoring tiles, should be recognized as significant' sounds reasonable with the dataset the paper primarily focuses on.

### Weaknesses
1. The intuition that "tiles with high attention scores that are surrounded by other high scoring tiles should be recognized as important. Conversely, the presence of a tile classified by the model as important in a low-scoring neighborhood ....could attributed to noise.." make sense for the particular dataset and task (" tumor cells are interspersed within large regions of normal cells") ,and also the crop size, that the paper looks at. However, it remains unclear how well this method generalizes to datasets beyond the particular choices of dataset and task focuses on in this paper.

2. Currently the neighbor-contrained idea is operationalized by masking the attention matrix (from self-attention) using the neighborhood mask. However, the attention scores from self-attention typically represent how much a tile attends to other tiles, not necessarily how much the slide-level prediction attends to that specific tile. It is not clear how directly masking on this attention matrix relates to the intuition above.

3. Feature extractor backbone is an important factor for final performance. Comparing with prior method TransMIL that uses similar transformer backbone, the performance gain from the proposed method is minimum.

### Questions
1. In the compared baselines, are self-supervised learning also employed to enhance the feature extractors?
2. In page4, what is Q1 and K1, did you define it before? What are the m selected landmarks?
3. Right below eq2, you talked about tile representations T, did you ever define it before? How is it different from H?

### Summary
This work proposes CAMIL - a MIL framework that applies neighborhood constraints to the transformer based MIL method, thus adding spatial context information. The method is tested on two MIL datasets - Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC subtyping, where it compares favorably to existing methods. Ablations explore the importance of adding the neighborhood constraint and Nystromformer module.

### Strengths
- The central idea behind the paper is simple yet effective; current methods do not account for the spatial dependencies among the patches in a WSI. This information is something that human experts use, and this work proposes an intuitive similarity mask to modify the attention values to reflect the local context.
- The paper is well-written and easy to read.
- The ablation studies serve to motivate the need for adding the neighborhood constraint module.

### Weaknesses
- In the appendix, the F1 score for TransMIL is better than CAMIL for Camelyon16 dataset. Can the authors explain about the level of imbalance in this dataset, and whether accuracy is the correct metric for this?
- Regarding the effectiveness of localization with this technique, the authors have produced some qualitative evidence in figure 3 and 4. However, since one of the main merits of this work is around better localization esp for problems with small foci of interest, can the authors a quantitative evaluation like in Table 1 in [1]?
- Currently, a comparison with DS-MIL [1] is missing. This would help to evaluate this work against a model that uses multi-scale features and motivate the need for local context even with a multi-scale featurizer.

### Summary
The authors highlight one of the central limitations of multiple instance learning that the relative position of tiles are not typically considered and have addressed this by implementing the neighbor-constrained attention module.  This augments the weighting of each individual tile based on the relative attention weighting of the neighbors of the tile from the whole slide image.  These local features are then integrated back with the global features for the slide level prediction. CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCL were used as benchmarking datasets and the performance of CAMIL model exceeded all other MIL frameworks except GTP on TCGA-NSCL dataset. It is noted that the local and global features independently perform well compared to other models but the combination show good outperformance.

### Strengths
Transmil had suggested that context is important on the whole slide level, perhaps as much as the context within individual tiles.  What the authors have done appears to have better defined this context awareness which better constrains the concept of neighborhood awareness for important information in a whole slide image.

### Weaknesses
I would like to see performance on more challenging datasets for which the slide level labels are not visual features, such as mutation prediction or something similar.

### Questions
You use SimClr to train the feature extraction encoder.  Have you test performance from other self-supervised pretrained encoders? Recent pre-prints suggest that larger ViT SSL trained encoders can benefit performance on less sophisticated aggregation functions.
