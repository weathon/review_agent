- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Camouflaged object detection (COD) is the challenging task of identifying camouflaged objects visually blended into surroundings. Albeit achieving remarkable success, existing COD detectors still struggle to obtain precise results in some challenging cases. To handle this problem, we draw inspiration from the prey-vs-predator game that leads preys to develop better camouflage and predators to acquire more acute vision systems and develop algorithms from both the prey side and the predator side. On the prey side, we propose an adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, which introduces an auxiliary generator to generate more camouflaged objects that are harder for a COD method to detect. Camouflageator trains the generator and detector in an adversarial way such that the enhanced auxiliary generator helps produce a stronger detector. On the predator side, we introduce a novel COD method, called Internal Coherence and Edge Guidance (ICEG), which introduces a camouflaged feature coherence module to excavate the internal coherence of camouflaged objects, striving to obtain more complete segmentation results. Additionally, ICEG proposes a novel edge-guided separated calibration module to remove false predictions to avoid obtaining ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments show that ICEG outperforms existing COD detectors and Camouflageator is flexible to improve various COD detectors, including ICEG, which brings state-of-the-art COD performance.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper presents an adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, generating more yet more challenging camouflaged objects to enhance generalizability. Additionally, it proposes a new COD method, ICEG to tackle the incomplete segmentation and ambiguous boundary limitations of existing methods.

### Strengths
- The inspiration from the prey-vs-predator game provides an interesting and effective COD method.
- Designed a 2-phase training pipeline combining the generation and detection.
- Proposed a Camouflageator with flexibility and generalizability that could be applied to various existing COD detectors.
- Proposed an ICEG detector including a CFC module and an ESC module which leads to a better segmentation quality.
- Achieved the state-of-the-art on four benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
- The paper mentions the proposed Camouflageator generates "more camouflaged objects that are harder for COD detectors" many times. However, the paper does not include a detailed description of the quantity or quality of the synthesized camouflaged objects.
- Though the generalizability of Camouflageator has been validated with ResNet50 based COD methods, the paper does not conduct experiments with other COD methods employing Res2Net50 and Swin as backbones. 
- Though Fig 5 indicates the ICEG has better segmentation quality in terms of completeness and boundaries compared to other methods, they do not provide the comparison (visualization) of how each module improves the backbone.

### Questions
- Please provide related statistics about the synthesized camouflaged objects? For example, the number of categories and the camouflaged property (e.g., color, contrasts, intensity comparisons of foreground and background).
- Please supplement the experiments regarding the Camouflageator generalizability with Res2Net50 and Swin based methods?
- Please provide the visualization maps of module ablations, and consider leveraging CAM-family (activation maps) for better illustration.

### Summary
The paper proposed to address COD on both the prey and predator sides. On the prey side, it introduced a novel adversarial training strategy, Camouflageator, to enhance the generalizability of the detector by generating more camouflaged objects harder for a COD detector to detect. On the predator side, it designed a novel detector, dubbed ICEG, to address the issues of incomplete segmentation and ambiguous boundaries.

### Strengths
++ An adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, for the COD task to employ an auxiliary generator that generates more camouflaged objects that are harder for COD detectors to detect and hence enhances the generalizability of those detectors. Camouflageator is flexible and can be integrated with various existing COD detectors.

++ A new COD detector, ICEG, to address the issues of incomplete segmentation and ambiguous boundaries that existing detectors face. ICEG introduces a novel CFC module to excavate the internal coherence of camouflaged objects to obtain complete segmen-tation results, and an ESC module to leverage edge information to get precise boundaries.

### Weaknesses
-- “CamDiff: Camouflage Image Augmentation via Diffusion Model” also utilizes the generation of camouflaged images to help with COD and should be included to the comparison.

-- There exist many COD methods are not mentioned in  RELATED WORK: CAMOUFLAGED OBJECT DETECTION part, like:
Mutual graph learning for camouflaged object detection
A Bayesian approach to camouflaged moving object detection
Uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning for camouflaged object detection
Deep texture-aware features for camouflaged object detection
Although some papers are cited, they need to be reflected in the related work

-- Why does Equation 4 use two losses for segmentation.

-- In Sec 3.2.1 Camouflaged consistency loss, what is the difference between the ideas in the paper and the contrastive loss

-- In Eq 17, are mu and sigma the same?
-- Why backbone chose resnet50 and not the transformer structure

### Questions
Please address my major concerns as listed in the Weaknesses section.

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The present paper proposes an innovative framework for the COD task based on adversarial training. While adversarial training has been established as an effective method in domains such as image classification, image/video deblur and object detection, this study successfully implemented it for the COD task. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on COD benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. The paper generally well written. 
2. The idea of using an adversarial generator to create more difficult training examples addresses an important weakness (lack of diversity) in existing COD datasets.
3. ICEG's modules for improving segmentation completeness and boundary precision tackle the limitations of prior work. The design choices are well-motivated.
4. Extensive experiments demonstrate SOTA results on multiple datasets. Ablations verify the contributions of individual components.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper presents two significant contributions: firstly, the introduction of an adversarial training framework for COD tasks, and secondly, the implementation of ICEG to overcome the limitations of incomplete segmentation and ambiguous boundaries for camouflaged objects. However, the two contributions seem disconnected, and they appear to be independent approaches aimed at enhancing network segmentation without a clear connection between them. Consequently, the primary storyline of the work is missing. The authors must establish the relationship between the two contributions and articulate how they work together to achieve the overall objective of the paper.

2. The adversarial training framework, which represents the primary contribution of this paper, is not a novel concept. Although it has yet to be implemented in COD tasks, the fundamental idea and implementation are similar to other tasks, such as image deblurring. It would be beneficial to underscore the unique difficulties and differences between COD and other tasks if the implementation is non-trivial.

3. Missing detailed descriptions for Figure 3. It lacks detailed descriptions and makes it challenging to comprehend the main idea presented. Given the complexity of the figure, it is important to provide proper explanations to ensure a comprehensive understanding. I think that the explanation of the network design may come across as a technical report and, as such, should be included in the supplementary material. In the body of the paper, I would like to see clear and concise motivations and rationales for each design, rather than technical details. The author should enhance the descriptions in Figure 3 to ensure they are easily understandable for readers.

4. It is imperative to ascertain the efficacy of the proposed adversarial training framework for other state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks by conducting ablations of the framework with alternative methods. This endeavor would furnish evidence to substantiate the generalizability of the proposed approach and its applicability to other networks.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper is inspired by the prey-vs-predator game, proposing novel algorithms from both the prey side and the predator side. An adversarial framework is proposed to generate more challenging camouflaged objects. While the ICEG aims to detect these objects. Experiments show that this paper achieves the best results.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is great. This paper takes advantage of adversarial training to generate harder camouflaged objects. This idea is novel. 
2. Their proposed Camouflageator is a plug-and-play framework. It is effective for ICEG and three existing methods.
3. The experiments are very detailed and thorough.

### Weaknesses
To some extent, the ICEG solved the incomplete segmentation. However, it fails to identify the foreground object when concealed objects have very similar structural information to the background. 

Many false positive detection results are outputted.
