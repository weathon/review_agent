## Abstract
While artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in revealing the relationship between biological macromolecules' primary sequence and tertiary structure, designing RNA sequences based on specified tertiary structures remains challenging. Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both cluster-level and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks. The source code and benchmark dataset are available at https://github.com/A4Bio/RDesign.

### Summary
This paper presents an approach to RNA design that leverages a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework.

### Strengths
1. The research problem addressed in the article is highly meaningful.
2. The method is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Some parts of the presentation are unclear. For instance, in Section 3.2, it isn't explicitly mentioned until the fourth page that each node represents a nucleotide base and not an atom. Although it becomes clear after reading the entire section, the author should clarify this earlier.
2. The section on "Biomolecular Engineering" in the related work part mainly discusses the significance of RNA design. I believe this content should be integrated into the introduction section rather than being placed under related work. Therefore, the organization of the article could be improved.
3. I find the article lacks novelty; the core multi-level representation learning relies on self-supervised methods from computer vision, which is not novel.
4. The baseline comparisons are incomplete. While the article compares some protein inverse folding methods, it fails to include recent protein inverse folding methods for comparison, such as ProteinMPNN and PiFold, which are mentioned in the related work section.
5. The dataset used in the experiments is not publicly available, making it impossible to directly compare the results with those in previously published works.
6. The author mentions collecting data to create a dataset, which is divided by sequence length. However, this approach is widely used in the protein domain and lacks innovation. Additionally, the author does not cite articles from the protein domain as references here.
7. The author claims to have aggregated and cleaned data from RNAsolo and PDB to create a new benchmark. I find this innovation to be insufficient, and the author does not clearly indicate the limitations of existing datasets or what constitutes "clean data". The motivation behind creating this new benchmark is not convincingly explained.

### Questions
My questions correspond to the weaknesses I mentioned above. Additionally, regarding the base pairs mentioned in Section 3.4, apart from the four mentioned, aren't GU and UG pairs also common?

**Minor Concern:**
1. In the "Inter-nucleotide level" section, there is a missing space between the second point and the following content.

### Summary
This paper presents a method for RNA inverse folding (i.e. given a RNA molecule’s 3D structure, predict the corresponding sequence). Coordinate information about an input molecule’s backbone is fed into a GNN which predicts a nucleotide for each node. Late representations from the GNN are also fed to contrastive losses which contrast structures with slightly perturbed structures, as well as structures with other structures of different folds. The authors demonstrate that this method outperforms other graph-learning methods, and also perform an ablation study to show the usefulness of each loss component (among other attributes).

### Strengths
### Interesting and sound architectural design choices

The authors started with a fairly standard GNN architecture, but several modifications and additions on it were made, which reasonably can be expected to improve RNA inverse folding. They adapted the coordinate system from Ingraham, et. al. 2019 to model RNA instead of proteins. The application of contrastive losses at multiple levels (i.e. the cluster-level loss and the sample-level loss) is well-motivated. Additionally, the imposition of secondary-structure constraints via confidence sharpening is a good idea. The ablation study presented also provides good evidence to the usefulness of these additions.

### Overall well-written with many details

Generally, the explanations were clear. Many details were included in the main text or in the supplement which made this paper straightforward to read and understand, which is very appreciated. There were only a few places which I found to be less clear, which will be detailed below. But overall, the clarity and presentation were very above par.

### Weaknesses
### Lack of comparison against other RNA inverse-folding methods

I consider this to be the most critical and crucial analysis that is missing. Although the paper does compare the proposed architecture (with its multi-level contrastive losses and secondary-structure loss) to other architectures like LSTMs or graph transformers, there aren’t any comparisons to any other methods which directly tackle the RNA inverse-folding problem. There are _many_ such methods, including several that are as recent as this year (e.g. MCTS-RNA, LEARNA, aRNAque, eM2dRNAs, etc.). Not having these comparisons really holds this paper back, because there is no understanding of how this method (which is being presented as a RNA inverse-folding method) compares to any other RNA inverse-folding method.
      
### Performance metrics are somewhat limited or measure less important aspects

Although there is some justification provided for the performance metrics focused on in the paper (i.e. recovery and Macro-F1), these metrics are still somewhat limited.

Recovery is simply “accuracy” here, and although this is a great metric to report, some bases will naturally be harder than others to predict. For example, bases participating in certain secondary structures, or those that interact with other residues in the 3D structure, may be easier or harder to classify. Thus, instead of reporting recovery/accuracy pooled over the entire macromolecule, it would be useful to see these numbers stratified by different secondary structures or tertiary attributes.

Macro-F1 is also not particularly clear. It summarizes precision and recall across the 4 different bases and averages them. Since the problem of inverse folding is effectively a classification problem, other more understandable metrics can be used, such as auROC and auPRC (or visualizing the ROC curve and PR curve across different methods). Again, these can be stratified by secondary structure or tertiary attributes.

Additionally, it would be useful to have a more systematic or global analysis of the accuracy of predicted secondary or tertiary structures. Figure 5 is very useful, but those are only a few examples. Having a more global analysis across the entire dataset would be very informative. 

### Potential leakage of RNA folds between training and test sets

The process of allocating the training/validation/test sets certainly took into account structural similarity by ensuring that different clusters of structures were allocated to entirely different sets. However, the clusters were generated pretty conservatively (i.e. TM score < 0.45, which is already a very low cut-off). This definition of clusters might be useful for contrastive learning, but it might still let a lot of similar structures to exist in both the training and test set. Instead of reusing the same clusters, it would be good to ensure that the TM scores between training/test sets are much more significantly different (compared to connected components of TM < 0.45), or splitting the training/test sets based on Rfam families to ensure distinct folds. An analysis that shows minimal cross-contamination of folds/structures/scaffolds between the training and test sets would help put this concern to rest.

### Some minor areas to clear up in writing

- The edge features should be $E\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times K\times f_m}$
- Equation 5 is not clear, and does not seem to match typical definitions of MPNNs; for example, it is unclear what the brackets mean and what $h_{E_{ij}}$ is doing on the left; also, it should be $\mathcal{N}(i, K)$ (capital $K$)
- Backwards quote around “reference” in Section 3.4
- In Section 3.4, the confidence scores $c_i$ are not used anywhere; are they equivalent to the model’s output probability? It should also be clarified that $s_i$ in Equation 8 are the true sequence labels

### Questions
- Is there a constraint that makes the learned representations more evenly distributed on the hypersphere after projection? The supplement claims that having evenly distributed points on the hypersphere allows the model to better leverage a limited dataset. The projection to hypersphere space just normalizes the magnitude of the representations, but I don’t see how that allows for the distribution of directions on the hypersphere to be uniform.

- Are the dataset splits identical for all baselines?

- Would sharpening confidence be helpful in non-paired residues, as well? It seems like that regularization was added to the paired residues, and the ablation study showed that it was helpful. Would it also be helpful if applied to all residues (not just the paired ones)?

### Summary
This manuscript proposes several methods for identifying the primary structure, or nucleic acid sequence, of an RNA molecule given its tertiary structure, or three-dimensional structure. RNA structure prediction, for reasons that will be discussed, is studied much less than protein structure prediction. This discrepancy presents two major issues: Firstly, there are not enough high-quality RNA structures to build models from, and secondly, there are not as many methods developed to predict RNA structure. Therefore, the authors initially compile and refine a dataset, carefully dividing it into training and testing sets, and then develop new algorithms to address this problem. Since there are no existing methods to predict the RNA sequence from its structure, the authors not only propose a novel method — inspired from Ingraham _et al._ (2019) — but also introduce five baseline methods for comparison. Finally, they test their models on two significant, completely independent datasets: Rfam and RNA-Puzzles.

### Strengths
The authors developing this method — the first of its kind — have done an impressive job on multiple fronts:

- Although the proposed method is an extension of the "protein structure to sequence" method proposed in Ingraham et al. (2019), RNA molecules are different from protein molecules, featuring more dihedral angles and a different local geometry. This necessitates the development of new encoding schemes.

- The attention and care the authors have devoted to compiling a clean RNA structure dataset are noteworthy. The training and testing splits are carried out in a structurally-informed manner, which is crucial in structural biology. Additionally, they have maintained similar length distributions.

- Given the limited availability of RNA structures, the authors employ a hierarchical representation learning scheme to address this challenge. This approach groups similar clusters together, much like protein fold families. They also utilize data augmentation by making slight alterations to RNA structures and ensuring their proximity in the latent space.

- The ablation study is informative and serves to justify the modeling decisions made by the authors.

- Impressively, the authors have also developed five baseline models.

### Weaknesses
Proteins are arguably not structurally simpler than RNAs, and a reader might get this impression from reading this manuscript. Most RNAs lack a defined structure, and the majority of RNAs do not function primarily through their structures. Even a large number of small non-coding RNAs function through base pairing, such as miRNAs. I believe the authors should demonstrate a tangible application for their proposed method. Is it intended for designing RNA aptamers? If so, how and why would it be superior to SELEX methods?

Minor Issues:
- Figure 4 could be made more clear; the green arrows appear too small. Additionally, clusters and samples within clusters should be better aligned.
- The last sentence of the second paragraph on page 2 is incomplete.

### Questions
I decided to move some of the perceived weaknesses to the questions:

- The base atoms are masked; however, purines (R or A/G) and pyrimidines (Y or C/T) differ significantly in size, and the model could have simply learned to predict the base using the spacing between the backbone atoms of neighboring nucleotides. This is not as significant of an issue in proteins, as there are twenty different side chains that do not canonically pair with each other. One way to test this is to evaluate performance by converting all A/G nucleotides to R and all C/T nucleotides to Y, then report recovery scores based on R and Y only. If this score is substantially higher than the original one, then the model may simply be learning whether bases are purines or pyrimidines.

- When constructing the neighborhood graph, wouldn't it be more intuitive to use a ball around each nucleotide? Could enforcing a fixed K result in some edges that are too distant in space?

- Can't this method be iterative? That is, determine the primary sequence from the structure, then compute secondary and tertiary structures from the inferred primary sequence, identify discrepancies, and predict a new primary sequence, repeating this process until a certain condition is met.

- Related to the previous question, is the "recovery score" the best metric? Is the goal to predict THE primary sequence or A primary sequence that gives rise to a very similar tertiary structure? Recovery scores, in general, tend to be low, and reporting predicted RMSD (e.g., using RhoFold) might be helpful in this regard.

- RNA structure is not entirely rigid, and some techniques like NMR can capture an ensemble of structures. Would all such structures in the bundle get the same sequence?

- Approximately 90% of RNA sequences are short (under 100 nt), and a Bayesian Optimization method might work well for this problem. It involves obtaining the tertiary structure, computing the secondary structure, starting with a random sequence, computing its secondary structure, and using the model to propose a new sequence until a close enough solution is found.

- Can Cohen's Kappa be used instead of or in addition to Macro F1?
