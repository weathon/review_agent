## Abstract
Transferability estimation aims to provide heuristics for quantifying how suitable a pre-trained model is for a specific downstream task, without fine-tuning them all. Prior studies have revealed that well-trained models exhibit the phenomenon of Neural Collapse.  Based on a widely used neural collapse metric in existing literature, we observe a strong correlation between the neural collapse of pre-trained models and their corresponding fine-tuned models. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel method termed Fair Collapse (FaCe) for transferability estimation by comprehensively measuring the degree of neural collapse in the pre-trained model. Typically, FaCe comprises two different terms: the variance collapse term, which assesses the class separation and within-class compactness, and the class fairness term, which quantifies the fairness of the pre-trained model towards each class. We investigate FaCe on a variety of pre-trained classification models across different network architectures, source datasets, and training loss functions. Results show that FaCe yields state-of-the-art performance on different tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, and text classification, which demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

### Summary
The paper studies the notion of transferability of pretrained models, ie how well one can predict the performance of a model on a downstram task after finetuning on the target dataset. The paper proposes using the degree of Neural Collapse  (Papyan et al., 2020) as a way of measuring the transferability of models. The proposed metric, FaCe, is a function of inter-/intra class covariance and distributions.

### Strengths
* The paper deals with a hard and open problem: transferabiltiy estimation

* It proposes a solution based on properties of NC of the pretrianed model, and shows some gains vs other transferability metrics.

* the paper seems reproducible, as the authors further shared code as supplementary materials

### Weaknesses
1. There is a very relevant related work that is discussing NC for transfer learning, that is currently not cited in this submission:
Galanti, Tomer, András György, and Marcus Hutter. "On the role of neural collapse in transfer learning." ICLR 2022.
The authors should discuss this paper and the contributions of the submission related to that. 

2. The authors claim that a key component of their method is the class fairness term. It is unclear how FaCe compares to a variant without that term (and everything else the same), ie if S_m = C_m and not C_m+F_m. There is no ablation to understand how this part affects the final metric. 

3. The experimental validation is weak. There are very few and small -scale datasets in Tab1, while even fewer in Tabs 2 and 3. A more extensive evaluation is needed to showcase any improvements of FaCe vs the other metrics. Currently this is not clear from Tab1 where there seems to not be a clear winner at all.


A note:
A very related concurrent work from ICCV 2023 should be cited and possibly also discussed (as concurrent work, of course, not limiting this papers novelty):
Wang, Zijian, et al. "How Far Pre-trained Models Are from Neural Collapse on the Target Dataset Informs their Transferability." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023.

### Questions
- Can you provide ablations for performance when only one of the two terms is used, ie C and F for FaCe? ie add two more columns in tables 1/2/3 with that. I understand that GBC is close, but it would be great to see the performance of your method, in your experimental setup, for each of the two terms separately and then together. I think this would help clarify the contribution of this paper. 

- What are only a subset of papers presented in Tab2 and 3? Ca you provide results for all, eg in an appendix if the issue is space?

### Summary
The paper introduces a metric designed to evaluate the transferability of a model trained under the so-called Terminal Phase of Training (TPT), at which neural collapse manifests. The key idea is to use a Gaussian distribution surrounding the collapsed feature. Subsequently, the Bhattacharyya score (available in this case in closed form) is computed to assess the difference between the pretrained model and its fine-tuned version. The authors support their approach with empirical evidence, drawing from multiple datasets and models.

### Strengths
The practical result of selecting the optimal model from a set of pretrained models, which best fine-tunes with the available data prior to training, appears to be a significant strength, given its potential appeal to a broad audience and its broader implications. Additionally, the closed-form formulation further shows its strength, with implications both in practical and theoretical contexts.

### Weaknesses
Considering the rapid dissemination of models online by third-party sources, the approach of selecting the optimal model for fine-tuning might have constrained applicability.

The assertion of a strong correlation is not clearly evident from the paper. For example It would be beneficial if from the experimental results some takeaway message were more explicit provided. In its current shape the paper requires visiting the experimental result section and understanding which specific model or architecture best transfer according to the proposed metric. Given that a significant portion of the paper's contribution is about empirical validation of the proposed transferability metric, this aspect should be improved. This is important as the paper claims "strong correlation" both in the abstract and conclusion. 

The paper frequently refers to the "domain shift" causing features not to lie on the hypersphere. The implications of this assertion are not clear, and what is meant by it being "too strict," needs clearer elaboration. The paper seems to lack a direct discussion on this. In which way not lying on the hypersphere is related to neural collapse? For instance, could the final classifier bias parameters be disregarded, thereby naturally aligning features with the hypersphere? The connection between domain shift and features not aligning with the hypersphere should be better clarified.

The metric introduced appears to hold even when training does not proceed until TPT. Given this, what is the significance of emphasizing the necessity for neural collapse in the proposed method?

### Summary
The "pre-training followed by fine-tuning" paradigm has become the standard training approach for many tasks in the deep learning domain. Selecting the appropriate pre-trained model for a specific downstream task poses a challenge. This paper introduces a transferability estimation method, Fair Collapse (FaCe). The method aims to determine a metric that indicates the potential performance of pre-trained models on a target dataset without the need to fine-tune every model. Ideally, transferability metrics should closely correlate with the actual performance post-fine-tuning.

### Strengths
1.The paper addresses a significant challenge in transfer learning: the selection of the optimal pre-trained model for a designated downstream task.
2.The correlation between neural collapse in pre-trained models and their subsequent fine-tuned versions is intriguing and serves as the foundation for the method proposed.
3.The introduced FaCe method is innovative and incorporates both class separation and class fairness, potentially preventing biases during model selection.
4.The array of experiments span multiple tasks and training methodologies, underscoring the robustness and universality of FaCe.

### Weaknesses
1.The introduction contains repetitive statements regarding transferability estimation and its objectives. For clarity and brevity, such redundancy should be avoided.
2.The meaning of the variable 't' in Equation (6) is not defined in the surrounding context.
3.When calculating the Variance Collapse, the authors assign equal weight to each category. However, during performance evaluation, categories with larger sample sizes play a more significant role. To ensure FaCe genuinely represents the potential performance of pre-trained models on the target dataset, the current setup seems somewhat flawed. An explanatory note from the authors is sought.
4.In the process of computing and presenting equidistance, the class fairness score F only explores equal distances of each class to the remaining classes. Due to the domain shift, features don't lie on a unit sphere. Thus, "equal distance of each class to the other classes" is not synonymous with "equal distances amongst all classes." The claim "Due to the domain shift, the features do not lie on the unit sphere" lacks sufficient justification. A detailed explanation from the authors would be appreciated.
5.The paper's primary contribution builds upon Variance Collapse by incorporating Class Fairness for a more accurate assessment of model fairness across classes. Yet, the experimental section lacks ablation studies on Class Fairness. To substantiate the effectiveness of the method, the inclusion of relevant experimental evidence is imperative.

### Questions
1.While employing FaCe as the criterion to judge the generalizability of pre-trained models in target domains, have the authors considered the impact of differences in class distributions and class counts between source and target domains?
2.The authors extended the concept of equiangularity to equidistance. In the process of calculating distances between classes, why was the current method chosen? Were alternative approaches contemplated?

### Summary
Prior studies have revealed that well-trained models exhibit the phenomenon of Neural Collapse (NC). The authors observe a strong correlation between the neural collapse of pre-trained models and their corresponding fine-tuned models. Considering the three characteristics of NC, the authors propose the Fair Collapse (FaCe) metric to help select pre-trained models that perform better after fine-tuning. FaCe consists of two key components: variance collapse term and class fairness term. The second components is the key contribution.

### Strengths
- The authors explore the impact of Neural Collapse (NC) in the "pre-training then fine-tuning" paradigm and observe that the ranking of NC in the pre-trained models remains mostly consistent during the fine-tuning process.
- The authors employ a metric Fair Collapse (FaCe) to estimate the transferability of pre-trained models.

### Weaknesses
- The first term of NC is common. This idea is commonly used in various classification tasks.
- The class fairness score F is used to make any class distribution has a similar overlap with the distribution of other classes. This is quite similar to making the distances between these distributions equal. 
- The fine-tuning hyperparameters of different pre-trained models may have a significant impact, and the phenomena observed in the paper might lack persuasiveness.
- The paper lacks experiments on the relationship between the accuracy of pre-trained models, the accuracy of fine-tuned models, and the proposed FaCe method.

Although the authors observed an interesting phenomenon, it may not be solid. They have not clarified the differences between their metric and those presented in other papers. All in all, at this point in time, I would recommend this paper as weak reject.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Inspired by Neural Collapse, the paper proposes a new metric, FaCe for transferability estimation. In addition to intra-class and iter-class distance, FaCe utilizes the third condition: all classes should be evenly spread in feature spaces. The third condition is evaluated by Bhattacharyya coefficient between class distributions, which is named Class Fairness. FaCe outperforms other methods in diverse benchmarks for transferability estimation.

### Strengths
- Motivation is clear and well supported by method design.
- Paper is well organized and easy to understand
- The performance of FaCe looks promising.

### Weaknesses
- Between-class covariance, $\Sigma_B$, is defined as the distance between the class avg and the global avg, which does not align with the definition of between-class, a distance between classes.

- Class Fairness term might be related to Variance Collapse term. Class Fairness term uses intra-class and inter-class covariance, which are also used in Variance Collapse term. But, the relationship between the two terms is not studied enough.

### Questions
- Why does between-class covariance $\Sigma_B$ in Variance Collapse use global average $h_G$ instead of class average $h_k$? I believe $\Sigma_B=\frac{1}{K} \Sigma_{k_i} \Sigma_{k_j} (h_{k_i} - h_{k_j})^2 $ would be more correct for the between-class covariance than $h_G$.

- Bhattacharyya coefficient looks similar to Variance Collapse term. Bhattacharyya coefficient is a multiplication between inverse within-class covariance and between-class covariance, while Variance Collapse is a multiplication of within-class covariance and inverse between-class covariance. How about replacing Variance Collapse with inverse Bhattacharyya coefficient for simplicity of formulation?
