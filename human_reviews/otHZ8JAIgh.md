## Abstract
Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction, especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an "intra-modal redundancy" issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an "inter-modal redundancy" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance of the joint prototypical distribution. Extensive experiments on five cancer benchmark datasets demonstrated our superiority over other methods. The code is released.

### Summary
This work introduces two different information-theory-based modules for multimodal (histology and genomics) survival prediction problem. Based on information bottleneck theory, these modules aim to remove redundant information, which are prevalent in WSIs, within each modality and across different modalities. In the process, the concept of prototypes are introduced to guide the learning of the multimodal prognosis framework, while only retaining necessary information.

### Strengths
- While the use of information bottleneck theory is not new in computational pathology, the use of it for 1) survival prediction setting and 2) reduction of intra-modal redundant information is quite novel.
- The authors conduct extensive baseline comparisons to demonstrate that PIBD framework indeed is better/highly-competitive compared to even the most recent baselines (MOTCat and SurvPath). This is to be appreciated by any fellow researchers looking to get understanding of the available survival prediction methods in CPath.
- Probabilistic modeling of the bag of patch features (although it leads to several variational approximations), opens up new avenues for probabilistic approaches for CPath, which have been under-explored thus far.

### Weaknesses
Clarity
- The explanation around PIB and PID need to be much more straightforward for the work to be appreciated. In its current form, it is really hard to understand and Section 3 lacks clarity. The authors should understand that typical readership of this article will either be pathologist or ML practitioner who would be less-versed in probabilistic and variational language. This, in my opinion, significantly reduces the impact of the paper as any other researcher hoping to reuse the framework for their own experiments. Authors should try to inject more  pathology-related intuition throughout the work.

Discriminative assumption
-  I am not sure if "discriminative" approach (despite its good performance as shown in the paper) is the right approach for survival. Different from diagnosis problems where subtype/grades are indeed decided with discriminative instances (patches), survival prediction problems are not as clear-cut. Certain morphological characteristics will overlap between different risk groups (or bands), which the current approach, centered around sampling positive/negative prototypes for maximum discrimination, is not well suited for.
- Related to the comment above, this approach seems only applicable to NLL loss, which treats the problem as a classification problem and thus have "different" bins (i.e., discretized timeline). What if more common loss functions, such as Cox PH or rank losses, were to be used that do not rely on such discriminative hypothesis?

Kaplan-Meier analysis
- In Kaplan-Meier analysis section, authors state that "our approach demonstrates significantly improved discrimination.... as indicated by lower p-values". While it is tempting to compare between p-values as a metric for separation of the risk groups, it is statistically not correct. Once these are below significance threshold, it shouldn't be over-interpreted. Maybe, use median survival days for each risk group?

Sampling operation
- Since both PID and PIB rely on sampling from distribution, it does seem that the performance will indeed by affected by which samples are chosen or how many of them are sampled. The discussion around this point needs to be made explicit.

Inference
- While there are detailed information about training procedure, not much is written about the actual inference step. For instance, how many samples for each prototype are required for reliable performance?

### Questions
- Motivation leading up to Eq. (5) is confusing. Why is large bag size an issue, if you can learn parametric mapping (via neural network) between z and x, similar to Eq. (4)? Wouldn't this simply be a matter of backpropagation in the training, which is scalable to numerous instances?
- Variational approaches involving NNs are known to be prone to mode collapse - What are the tricks/methods used in the work to prevent it?
- I think the introduction of Markov chains confuses the paper more - Perhaps better to remove it.
- Eq. (6) - Can't we simply use KL divergence to assess the similiarity (distance), if both p(z|x) and p(\hat{z}|y) are normal distributions?
- Usually the use of "Top-k" refers to small number of instances being selected. However, from implementation section, it seems the authors are using 50~80% of the entire bag? Am I misunderstanding something?

### Summary
This work presents PIBD (Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling) for multimodal survival analysis using pathology and genomics, which extends previous progress thus far on co-attention-based early-based fusion [1] and learning information bottleneck [2] in computational pathology via two mechanisms: 1) a Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and 2) a Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Experimentation is performed on the same splits for disease-specific survival analysis in Jaume et al. [1], with comparisons against other relevant works (both unimodal and multimodal) and ablation experiments that assess PIB and PID independently.

### Strengths
- As summarized above, extensive experimentation regarding comparisons, ablation studies, and assessment of multiple cancer types is performed. In particular, this work compares with many state-of-the-art multimodal methods such as MCAT (both concatenation and Kronecker Product), SurvPath, MOTCat, and other relevant information bottleneck-related works. Beyond ABMIL and TransMIL, other strong unimodal methods such as the task-specific finetuning variant of CLAM is also considered. Background information and literature is also extensive, with many important studies related to PIBD cited in a comprehensive manner.
- The proposed PID and PIB methodology, though largely adapted and inspired by other IB applications in computational pathology such as that of Li et al. 2023, is (on balance) appropriate for its extension into survival analysis w.r.t. addressing sparsity of patch features in MIL via prototypes. Figure 1 is informative and communciates how PID/PIB are used.

### Weaknesses
- **Limited findings w.r.t. clinical application / multimodal interpretability**: PID/PIB is intuitive for solving multimodal integration problems of WSIs and gene sets, but the demonstrated findings of this work appears limited to only improvement of c-Index performance. Methodologies such as MOTCat and SurvPath, though not approaching survival analysis from an information bottleneck perspective, similarly resolve issues regarding redundancy of patch features in MIL and reach similar findings already established in prior works. The interpretability experiments, shown as attention heatmaps in the supplement, are difficult to interpret and draw conclusions from. As the improvement in c-Index is minor, it would be valuable to investigate the interpretability of PIBD, for example: (1) performing local and global interpretability to assess individual and cohort-level image-omic drivers of disease survival, or (2) experiment+showcase unique clinical applications that would arise from PIBD that cannot be performed in other methods, which would produce new scientific findings and expand this study's significance. In particular, I found the prototypical aspect of this work to be intriguing, with concurrent works also realizing (and finding new applications) of using prototypical patterns for pathology [5].
- **Ablation Experiments for PIB/PID**: Some baselines do not seem fair in the PID/PIB ablation experiments.
- - In ablating PID, the baseline model considered was average pooling the prototypical features - a more appropriate baseline would be to use a non-disentangled Transformer like TransMIL on top of the prototypical features. 
- - In ablating PIB, the reviewer is not certain what the baseline looks like (using PID without PIB), but would think that this comparison would be similar to having each modality being processed by a TransMIL-like encoder + PID (or SurvPath + PID). 
- **Using CTransPath for TCGA evaluation**: A limitation of this study is the usage of CTransPath (pretrained on TCGA) for training and evaluating MIL models for survival analysis in TCGA. Understandably, access to powerful pretrained encoders for pathology is challenging, due to: (1) lack of computing power, and (2) lack of diverse and independent data outside of TCGA, with other studies in computational pathology such as Jaume et al. [1] and Filliot et al. [2] having also conducted survival analyses via TCGA-pretrained encoders. This limitation could remain as "a limitation of this study" (fitted in the conclusion) as the novelties of this work are with respect to the MIL encoder (all comparisons are performed using the same features and evaluated in the same way), in combination with the aforementioned challenges in computational pathology. However, as the broader pathology and machine learning community is becoming more aware of potential biases that emerge from data contamination of self-supervised models that are also trained using the evaluation data (as seen in LLMs and other studies [3-7]), it is important for advances going forward to recognize and resolve this issue and to develop better standardization for developing and evaluating MIL methods.

### Questions
Primary Questions and Suggestions
- Current application and findings of PIBD overlap with other multimodal survival analysis works wr.t. to addressing patch feature redundancy, and having similar interpretability experiments. How does the contributions and findings of this work advance the field further?
- Ablation experiments for PID/PIB can have stronger baselines.
- Evaluating PIBD with a ResNet-50 encoder (ImageNet transfer) or a non-TCGA-pretrained encoder would strength the study and its findings.

Minor Questions
- How are CLAM-SB / CLAM-MB adapted for survival analysis? To the reviewer's knowledge, the implementation of the CLAM framework is mostly situated for slide classification (not survival), as the clustering constraints in CLAM are most appropriate for subtyping problems.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to predicting survival outcome by combining histology and genomics data. The model incorporates two novel components based on information bottlenecks in information theory: prototypical information bottleneck and prototypical information disentanglement.

### Strengths
The problem is well defined and the introduced method is appropriate with detailed explanation and evaluation. Results represent a meaningful improvement on prior state of the art approaches. The analysis is thorough and builds upon established practices in the literature. Although the advances over the state of the art are modest, it does represent a consistent improvement compared to other methods across all datasets.

### Weaknesses
There are very few weaknesses with this paper. 

The evaluation could be improved by adding a “naive” combination of the risk scores from genomics and histology. This could be performed by taking the best performing models which look at an individual modality – i.e. SNNTrans and CLAM-MB – and then combining the predictions of these models using a Cox proportional hazards model against the original survival outcome data. This would act as a suitable baseline to see to what extent learning the combined risk prediction model as described in this work outperforms a naive approach to combining the risk prediction across the two modalities. This would allow the reader to fully understand the added benefit of the model described over the other approaches.

### Questions
Kaplan-Meier analysis: please state how cut-offs were selected in the manuscript. 

Please see comment about combining individual modality predictions using CoxPH as a “naive” baseline. 

The appendix gives some discussion of hyperparameter choices, although it is not clear how these were selected with the dataset. As cross validation is used to generate the evaluation results, to what extent were the hyperparameters selected using the evaluation datasets and is there risk of selection bias as a result?
