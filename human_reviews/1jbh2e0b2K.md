- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Foundation models have emerged as a powerful tool for many AI problems. Despite the tremendous success of foundation models, effective adaptation to new tasks, particularly those with limited labels, remains an open question and lacks theoretical understanding. 
  An emerging solution with recent success in vision and NLP involves finetuning a foundation model on a selection of relevant tasks, before its adaptation to a target task with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we study the theoretical justification of this multitask finetuning approach. 
Our theoretical analysis reveals that with a diverse set of related tasks, this multitask finetuning leads to reduced error in the target task, in comparison to directly adapting the same pretrained model. We quantify the relationship between finetuning tasks and target tasks by diversity and consistency metrics, and further propose a practical task selection algorithm.
  We substantiate our theoretical claims with extensive empirical evidence.
Further, we present results affirming our task selection algorithm adeptly chooses related finetuning tasks, providing advantages to the model performance on target tasks.
  We believe our study shed new light on the effective adaptation of foundation models to new tasks that lack abundant labels.

### Summary
This paper studies multitask finetuning for adapting foundation models to new tasks in few-shot. It provides a theoretical justification to analyze the multitask finetuning and a practical task selection algorithm for choosing good finetuning tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze multitask finetuning for foundation models, providing definitions and analysis of task diversity and consistency. Based on the theoretical concepts, the authors introduce a practical task selection algorithm.
- The authors conducted extensive experiments and showed the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the direct adaptation and full fine-tuning baseline.
- The overall writing is good, which clearly explains the problem, approach, analysis and results.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical part discussed diversity and consistency, but the method part simplifies consistency to similarity and diversity to coverage. So the final algorithm is basically a similarity-based sorting. The simplicity is not a problem, but I wonder if it is really related to the theoretical concepts.
- The authors evaluated the proposed algorithm on a wide range of datasets/models, but how does it compare with some stronger baselines besides direct adaptation and full fine-tuning, e.g. meta-learning algorithms?

### Summary
This paper presents theoretical results that to adapt a pretrained model to a target task, it is beneficial to first finetune the model on a diverse set of related tasks and then tune the model on the target task. The authors prove the theorems by first defining the diversity and consistency between different tasks that the model is going to adapt to, where diversity refers to the coverage of the other tasks on the target task and consistency refers to the similarity between the other tasks and the target task. Then, under some Lipschitzness assumptions, sufficient consistency and diversity assumptions, and sufficient tasks and sufficient sample assumptions (on the finetuning tasks, not the target task), the model with multitask finetuning can achieve a reduced error on the target task compared to the setting without multitask finetuning. Moreover, the authors propose a multitask selection algorithm based on the consistency and diversity requirements. Experimental results indicate that with the proposed multitask selection, the ViT-B model achieves better results on multiple target datasets, and increasing the number of tasks and the number of samples per task are most effective in improving target task performance. Lastly, with multitask finetuning, various pretrained models achieve better results than direct adaptation / standard finetuning on multiple datasets.

### Strengths
- The presented theoretical results are quite intuitive -- if the tasks in multitask finetuning are diverse and consistent with the target task $T_0$, then the model with pretraining followed by multitask finetuning achieves better target prediction performance than the model only with pretaining. My intuition is that, through the training/finetuning on the proxy tasks, the model learns some knowledge related to the target tasks. It is nice that the authors present the theorems that support this intuition, although I didn't verify the proofs. 
- Although the theorems are not directly applicable to real problems, the authors propose a practical Consistency-Diversity Task Selection algorithm, which is effective in experiments. The algorithm is a nice method to try for target task adaption in the real world.
- The overall experiments are quite extensive and echo the theoretical results, clearly demonstrating the advantages of multitask finetuning over standard finetuning and direct adaptation.

### Weaknesses
- The Gaussian distribution assumption in Section 3.2 may not be realistic, leading to biased task selection that may be suboptimal to the model performance on the target task. However, it is okay to derive further refined algorithms in future work.

### Questions
- I found the notations in Section 3.1 (Linear Data and Tasks) somewhat difficult to understand. $T_{z, z'}$ is discussed in the text but how is it related to the $T_i (i = 1, \dots, M)$ in figure 1? It would ease the reader's understanding by revising the explanation in that part. 
- Does the Experiment Protocol apply to all three major experiments (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3)? It seems to me that the experiments have their own protocols, which causes confusion.
- What are the multitasks for finetuning in Section 4.3?

### Summary
Given a pretrained foundation model, a target task with limited labeled samples, and a bunch of auxiliary tasks possibly with many labeled data, this paper analyzes how to select good auxiliary tasks to finetune the foundation model first, then adapt the auxiliary-task-finetuned model to the target task (a.k.a multitask finetuning), such that the resultant model can outperform the model that directly adapted to the target task from pretraining, or the model that finetuned with all the auxiliary tasks before adaption. To this end, the authors derive several bounds which indicate that the model with multitask finetuning outperforms that without, and the selected auxiliary tasks should be sufficiently diverse and have good consistency w.r.t. the target task. According to this, the authors formulate an auxiliary-tasks-selection algorithm, whose outperformance over standard finetune is validated on various datasets.

### Strengths
1. Several bounds about multitask finetuning are derived.
2. The multitask finetuning with task selection outperforms that finetuned on all the tasks.
3. The experiments have been extensively performed on a dozen of datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. While several bounds have been derived, their implications are quite straightforward. For instance, the model with multitask fine-tuning outperforms the one without it, and the selected auxiliary tasks should exhibit sufficient diversity and strong consistency w.r.t. the target task, are well accepted by the community, despite those being derived based on the somewhat strict assumptions. It would be more valuable if these bounds could lead to novel insights that were previously overlooked by the community.
2. Such limitation also lies in the task-selection algorithm, where the authors simply assume a Gaussian distribution of features, then use the angle of mean and variance-scaled L2 distance indicating the consistency and the diversity.
3. As \phi evolves during the training, should Algorithm 1 perform repeatedly during the training?
4. The paper in its current version is quite difficult to read, it is suggested to give more intuition before diving into the derivation, and also simplify/brief the symbols if applicable.

### Questions
1. Why does the performance decrease with the increase of sample shots in Fig. 2a?
2. Is Standard FT in Table 2 the same as All in Table 1?
3. First Paragraph on Page 4, In contrastive pretraining -> In contrastive to pretraining; First Paragraph on Page 7, the cosine similarity similarity -> the cosine similarity
4. It seems that Theorem 3.3 (or the index 3.3) is missing in the main text.

### Summary
This paper explores how to effectively adapt foundational models to new tasks, especially those with limited labeled data. The authors investigate a multi-task fine-tuning approach, wherein the foundational model is fine-tuned for a set of related tasks before fine-tuning it for the target task.

### Strengths
The paper provides a theoretical analysis, revealing that fine-tuning with a diverse set of related tasks reduces errors in the target task compared to directly adapting a pre-trained model. The authors introduce diversity and consistency metrics to quantify the relationship between fine-tuning tasks and the target task and propose a practical task selection algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. In Section 1.1, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed enumeration of recent advancements in the field of multitask fine-tuning.
2. I suggest adding some diagrams in Section 3.2 to visually illustrate the entire process. Visual representation will help readers gain a clearer understanding and assess the effectiveness of task selection.
3. I suggest conducting more detailed ablation experiments for TASK SELECTION to provide stronger evidence for its effectiveness.
4. The experimental section lacks sufficient detail, such as the absence of descriptions for hyperparameter settings. Providing these details would make the findings more convincing.
