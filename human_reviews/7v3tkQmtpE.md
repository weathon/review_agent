## Abstract
Decision Transformer (DT) is an innovative algorithm leveraging recent advances of the Transformer architecture in sequential decision making. However, a notable limitation of DT is its reliance on {recalling} trajectories from datasets, without the capability to seamlessly stitch them together. In this work, we introduce a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of \emph{Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning}. At the time of making decisions, a \emph{high-level} policy first proposes an ideal \emph{prompt} for the current state, a \emph{low-level} policy subsequently generates an action conditioned on the given prompt. We show how DT emerges as a special case with specific choices of high-level and low-level policies and discuss why these choices might fail in practice. Inspired by these observations, we investigate how to jointly optimize the high-level and low-level policies to enable the stitching capability. This further leads to the development of new algorithms for offline reinforcement learning. Finally, our empirical studies clearly demonstrate the proposed algorithms significantly surpass DT on several control and navigation benchmarks. We hope that our contributions can inspire the integration of Transformer architectures within the field of RL.

### Summary
This study introduces the Autotuned Decision Transformer (ADT), a novel approach that employs a hierarchical structure, substituting the traditional returns-to-go (RTG) with prompts derived from a high-level policy. The paper presents two specific variants of this innovative prompting mechanism: V-ADT, which utilizes prompts designed to optimize learned value functions; G-ADT, where the prompts provide subgoals, strategically directing the policy toward the ultimate objective. Proposed methods demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional DT-based techniques and hierarchical methods on the standard D4RL benchmarks.

### Strengths
**Strength 1: Effective Approach to a Critical Issue**

This paper addresses a crucial issue in the realm of Decision Transformers (DT), particularly the challenge associated with handling the returns-to-go (RTG) and integrating value functions during the DT training phase. There is widespread agreement on the necessity of this challenge within the field. The proposed solution, which involves learning a prompt to feed into the policy of the DT, is not only a plausible approach but also one that has been empirically substantiated, showing enhanced effectiveness over existing DT-based methodologies. This validation underscores the method's potential impact and applicability within the discipline.

**Strength 2: Noteworthy Innovation in Synthesis**

While the individual components utilized in the proposed method might not be pioneering in isolation—such as the employment of in-sample optimal values (akin to value-based approaches like IQL), the adoption of hierarchical structures for subgoals (seen in strategies like HIQL), or the application of weighted regression techniques (as in AWR)—the paper's true innovation lies in the synthesis of these elements within the framework of Decision Transformers. 

The authors have skillfully amalgamated these various concepts, producing a methodology that, in its entirety, presents a significant departure from conventional approaches. This fusion of ideas, culminating in a cohesive and well-articulated study, embodies substantial novelty. 

**Strength 3: Insightful Ablations**

Given the many components of the proposed method, it's important to empirically validate the source of the gain the proposed method may offer. In this sense, the authors made a great effort on additional experiments from page 7 to 9.

### Weaknesses
**Weakness 1: Limited Empirical Superiority**

The primary data presented in Table 1 indicate that while V-ADT demonstrates a notable advancement over other DT-based methods, it fails to consistently surpass or significantly differentiate itself from value-based strategies. This observation is critical, particularly since V-ADT incorporates a value function trained via IQL during the formation of its high-level policy, suggesting that its performance should be directly contrasted with these value-based counterparts. The authors' choice to emphasize the superiority of V-ADT within the DT category, marked in bold, might inadvertently misguide readers regarding the method's comparative effectiveness. It remains unclear why V-ADT, despite leveraging the advantages of pre-trained IQL values, does not achieve a substantial performance lead over IQL itself. A more in-depth discussion on this aspect would enhance the paper's credibility and help readers understand the practical implications and potential limitations of integrating value-based components within a DT framework.

**Weakness 2: Insufficiency of Information for Replicability**

The absence of shared code alongside the paper significantly hampers the research's transparency and the reproducibility of its findings. The explanation provided in Appendix A, particularly the vague descriptions in the concluding section, lacks the detailed guidance necessary for readers to independently replicate and verify the proposed method's effectiveness. Considering the empirical foundation upon which the method stands, it is imperative for the authors to release the corresponding code, ensuring that peers can thoroughly evaluate, validate, or even potentially improve upon the methodology.

### Questions
Question 1) The comprehensive ablation studies provided are certainly insightful. Could the authors elaborate on their specific choice of using antmaze for these ablations (not MuJoCo), considering its characteristic sparse rewards and diverse objectives?

### Summary
This paper investigates transformer-based decision models through a hierarchical decision-making framework, and proposes two new transformer-based decision models for offline RL. Specifically, the high-level policy suggests a prompt, following which a low-level policy acts based on this suggestion. Empirical studies show some improvements over DT on several control and navigation benchmarks.

### Strengths
The study of integrating decision transformers into a hierarchical setting is interesting to the HRL community, for understanding the benefits as well as limitations of the DT based approach. The two proposed models seem to be technically sound. The empirical studies seem to be comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. Integrating decision transformers into a hierarchical setting has already been studied in an earlier paper [*], especially corresponding to the goal-conditioned version. This paper wasn’t cited or discussed. 
2. The paper doesn’t dive into the analysis of the reason why the proposed approach outperforms or underperforms the baseline methods. For instance, when comparing with HRL baselines, it was simply mentioning that “Given that V-ADT and G-ADT is trained following the IQL and HIQL paradigm, respectively, the achieved performance nearing or inferior to that of IQL and HIQL is anticipated” - but why?  Is it due to the generated subgoals or non-stationarity issues? The reasons behind the observations are more valuable to the community. 
3. In V-ADT, does the high level provide prompt at every time step? If it does, it is arguably a hierarchical setting since there is no clear decomposition of a global goal or task. What is the reward function of the high level?
4. It’s not clear to me how the high level generates returns which are not covered in the offline dataset either? i.e., how could you avoid the issues you stated in Sec. 2

### Summary
This paper presents an in-depth examination of a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approach applied to decision transformers (DT). The study begins by shedding light on various challenges within the realm of DT, primarily focusing on issues like inaccurate return-to-go (RTG) estimates resulting from initial estimations and the inability perform stitching. The authors propose a solution by introducing a simple network, conditioned solely on the current state, which generates a prompt for the high-level policy. Furthermore, they refine the low-level policy by conditioning it on both the state, historical data (excluding returns), and the generated prompt to enhance in context learning.  Advantage regression is used to train the low-level policy since the value tokens are not conditioned on the actions. The paper explores two distinct prompt styles: one based on value, learned using in-sample optimal value, to address the RTG estimation issues, and another that outputs a goal state prompt, learned using HIQL.

The experimental component encompasses a variety of D4RL environments, with particular emphasis on hierarchical envs. The results show improvements mainly in the hierarchical environments. It also shows issues related to variance when tuning target returns, showcasing consistent performance using the proposed approaches. Additionally, the paper provides insights through various ablations, which involve removing RL losses and prompts, among other factors.

### Strengths
- This work gives a well-thought-out approach compared to most existing research involving HRL in the context of decision transformers. It addresses specific challenges, such as the problems associated with RTG estimates, in a systematic manner, such as by introducing value tokens.
- The introduction of value-based prompts represents a novel contribution, and the adjustment of the low-level policy loss to accommodate this is a good improvement.
- The paper includes a substantial number of offline baselines and conducts numerous experiments in hierarchical environments, as well as those involving complex stitching operations.
- The ablation studies effectively illustrate the significance of each component within the proposed approach.
- The paper is easy to read and very well written.

### Weaknesses
I have two main concerns about this work:

- The experimental results presented in the paper appear to lack significance. For instance, in Table 2, the performance of G-ADT is nearly indistinguishable from that of the waypoint transformer. In Table 1, V-ADT demonstrates significant improvements over DT only in the of antmaze environments, with results still falling short of IQL.
- While the application of various RL losses to DT within a hierarchical framework has elements of novelty, the significance of these contributions may be undermined by the underwhelming experimental outcomes.

In light of the concerns regarding the lack of experimental significance, it is recommended to consider a weak rejection. The work remains principled and thought-provoking; however, additional experimental evaluations are essential to further substantiate its claims and contributions.

### Questions
Can more HRL environment experiments be shown?

Can the authors put the significance of the work into context better (especially experimentally)?

### Summary
This paper proposes to integrate a hierarchical architecture with the decision transformer architecture to automatically tune the “prompts”. The prompt in this paper mainly corresponds to the reward-to-go in the original DT paper, and is also extended to the notion of “goal”. The paper proposed an automated decision transformer (ADT), and its two versions, including V-ADT and G-ADT. Experimental results in continuous control tasks show that ADT shows better performances than baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper focuses on a solid problem which is manually selecting a pre-defined expected reward is often difficult and can result in suboptimal outcomes.

 - The ablation study is interesting.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is missing key related works, such as prompt decision transformer studying the prompting mechanism for continuous control tasks in multi-task setting and hierarchical decision transformer, which has a similar motivation of using a hierarchical architecture.

    - Hierarchical decision transformer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10447.pdf

 - Although the problem is quite solid, and the paper is trying to propose a general hierarchical framework to tackle the problem, the paper is still focusing on single-task learning, which is a relatively narrow scope.

 - The methodology is hard to follow, and the design choice is not fully discussed. 

 - The motivating example in Section 2.2.1 does not quite connect to the proposed methodology and leads to confusion. The example provided in section 2.2.1 is mainly about the data coverage issue. The proposed method seems to still learning Q, V, or goal from the offline dataset. How the proposed method can help solve the problem is still unclear.

### Questions
- For the hierarchical policy, why condition on the current state is sufficient? 

 - Does the method’s performance heavily depend on the learned Q and V function from IQL?

 - How the proposed method can help solve the example problem in section 2.2.1 (no trajectory a->b->c)?

 - How is the proposed method different from the hierarchical decision transformer?
