## Abstract
Regression and low-rank approximation are two fundamental problems that are applied across a wealth of machine learning applications. In this paper, we study the question of socially fair regression and socially fair low-rank approximation, where the goal is to minimize the loss over all sub-populations of the data. We show that surprisingly, socially fair regression and socially fair low-rank approximation exhibit drastically different complexities. Specifically, we show that while fair regression can be solved up to arbitrary accuracy in polynomial time for a wide variety of loss functions, even constant-factor approximation to fair low-rank approximation requires exponential time under certain standard complexity hypotheses. On the positive side, we give an algorithm for fair low-rank approximation that, for a constant number of groups and constant-factor accuracy, runs in $2^{\text{poly}(k)}$ rather than the na\"{i}ve $n^{\text{poly}(k)}$, which is a substantial improvement when the dataset has a large number $n$ of observations. Finally, we show that there exists a bicriteria approximation algorithm for fair low-rank approximation that runs in polynomial time.

### Summary
The paper studies the two problems of socially fair regression and socially fair low rank approximation (rank $k$). By "socially fair", it means the objective is to minimize the maximum value of loss over given 'protected' groups. The authors show simple polynomial time algorithms for fair regression however they show hardness results for even constant factor approximation to the fair LRA(Low rank approximation) problem. Under certain assumptions, the authors show a $2^{poly(k)}$ algorithm for the fair LRA problem. The authors use sketching techniques and several well-known results from randomized numerical linear algebra to achieve this. The authors support their theoretical claims with a set of proof -of -concept empirical results.

### Strengths
1) Regression and Low rank approximation are fundamental problems in Machine Learning and fairness is becoming a very essential aspect   of ML. As such the problems are important and will be of interest to the community.
2) The algorithms for fair regression are very simple and intuitive.
3) Though, according to me, the main and most technical contribution of the paper is theoretical in nature i.e., complexity analysis of the fair LRA problem, the authors have provided small set of experiments for the fair regression problem which allows a simple algorithm. The experiments complement well with the simple algorithms.
4) The paper, for the most part, is written clearly and appears sound (only had a high-level look at the proofs). Related work section is quite thorough.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper uses many existing results from randomized numerical linear algebra and other literature for the main technical results. Although I don't consider this by itself a weakness (in fact the ideas are combined nicely), it does have the unintended effect of making the paper less accessible to readers unfamiliar with the areas. It would be helpful if the writeup following theorems 1.5 and 1.6 is modified to make it more accessible.

### Questions
1. The question might sound a little basic. However, correct me if I am wrong, when you talk about the exponential time, you are only talking about time in terms of $k$ and not $n$ right? If yes please make it clearer, else it may create confusion regarding theorems 1.4 and 1.5. 

2. What is the run time of the algorithm for bicriteria approximation in terms of $k$?
3. I believe here the groups are non-overlapping. Can you comment on the results were the groups overlapping?
4. What is the significance of the $\Delta$ in theorems 1.1. and 1.2. Is it guaranteed that the optimal $\mathbf{x}$ will also lie in the range given by $\Delta$?

My score is weak accept due to some of the confusion. I will be happy to raise the score if the above questions are answered satisfactoritly.

### Summary
This paper analyzed fair regression and fair low-rank approximation theoretically with an empirical evaluation of their proposed method of fair regression. The authors show by theorems that the low-rank approximation has a much larger computation complexity than the regression under fairness requirements. They propose two algorithms for approximation solutions for fair low-rank approximation.

### Strengths
The theoretical results for the fair low-rank approximation look novel and valuable to me. 

The difference between the computation complexity of fair regression and other fair machine learning tasks (in this paper, the low-rank approximation) is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. There is no real-world application or numerical evaluation of the proposed fair low-rank approximation method, which I think is more important than the evaluation of the fair regression method shown in Section 4. 
2. There is no comparison between the proposed methods and other methods in the existing literature. For example, for fair regression, the authors may want to compare their convex solver method to Abernethy et al. (2022). 
3. The contribution to socially fair regression seems limited since the method is simple and based on the observation in Abernethy et al. (2022). 
4. This paper is not well-organized. Section 1.1 about the contributions is overwhelmingly long (about 2.5 pages), most of which is about the fair low-rank approximation which I think can be put in Section 3, especially since some parts in Section 1.1 and Section 3 are overlapped.

Some typos:
1. Page 4. 'Thus we consider the multi-response regression problem $\min_{B^{(i)}} \max_{i\in[\ell]}$ ...' I don't understand the $B^{(i)}$ since $i$ in used in the $\max$.
2. Theorem 1.5. $\delta$ is not defined.
3. Page 26. 'paragraphSynthetic dataset' looks strange to me.
4. In Algorithm 4 Line 2. It is unclear where S is generated from.

### Questions
1. For the approximate fair low-rank approximation, is it possible to have corresponding lower bounds for Theorems 1.5 and 1.6?
2. Can we replace the probability value 2/3 in Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 with some value $\xi$ which can be as close to 1 as possible or converge to 1 w.r.t. n? Otherwise, it seems like finding the approximate solution is still not guaranteed with high confidence.
3. The equation $\max \\|x\\|_\infty = (1\pm \epsilon)\\|x\\|_p$ in the beginning of Section 3.2 is surprising to me. Is there a typo?

### Summary
The paper solves socially fair regression and low-rank approximation problems. It shows that fair regression can be solved up to some accuracy in polynomial time. A constant factor approximation of a fair low-rank approximation problem requires longer time that exponentially depends on k.

### Strengths
The paper shows that an additive error approximation can be achieved in poly(n,d,eps^(-1)) for Lp regression where p in (1, infinity). It also gives an nnz(A) running time algorithm that ensures a relative error approximation of the problem.

It shows that getting a constant factor low-rank approximation for the socially fair low-rank problem is np-hard. Howeve, the running time reduces drastically when the approximation factors are functions of poly(l,k).

### Weaknesses
See questions.

### Questions
k-means clustering can also be viewed as constraint low-rank approximations. Can the socially fair low-rank approximation be used to solve the socially fair k-means clustering problem?

Notations are not well defined and difficult to follow, eg alpha is well defined in the context where ever it has been used.

### Summary
This paper studies two fair learning problems.

### Strengths
The paper has its own technical merits.

### Weaknesses
There are two major flaws:

First of all, the fair regression notion is very different from literature. The referee is afraid that this notion may not be meaningful at all. Since each group is more desired to match the prediction values rather than the losses. Please carefully go over the literature on fair regression.

Second, the low-rank approximation has not too much to do with fair regression. Piling two topics into one paper is making referee wondering that the contributions of this paper are insufficient on both ends.

With that, the referee recommends a rejection.
