# LSP: Low-Power Semi-structured Pruning for Vision Transformers

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings.

### Summary
The paper proposes a block-structured pruning approach to prune the network, which leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers as a more efficient pruning scheme for ViTs compared to unstructured or channel-wise structured pruning. They propose a hardware-aware learning objective is introduced to optimize the block pruning scheme, which maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference. They use a lightweight algorithm utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization is provided for post-training pruning of ViTs.

### Strengths
1. The semi-structured (block-wise) pruning is a promising direction to explore.
2. The paper is easy to follow. 
3. ViT compression is a important topic as the requirement in both industrial applications and academic research.

### Weaknesses
1. The introduction and discussion on network pruning appear to omit several milestone works in the field. It seems the authors may not thoroughly discuss the milestone contributions in the related works. There's a potential confusion between pruning at initialization and post-training pruning. Notably, pivotal works such as Han 2015 [1, 2] and HRank 2020 [3] are absent, while references to some arXiv papers are included. I recommend that the authors structure the related works section with more precise logic. Also, the authors claim that CNNs pruning can be divided into three categories, yet only two are presented. 
2. What is the i.d.d. in Assumption 1?
3. The experimental results presented seem limited. In Table 1, the authors only explore DeiT-small and Base. It would be beneficial if the authors expanded their experiments to include, at least, DeiT-Tiny, T2T, and other ViTs, considering various pruning ratios. Also, the improvement from UVC is minimal on Deit-Base model.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new block-structured sparse method, which is more fine-grained than the channel-wise structured sparse methods and can also achieve speedup due to the structured sparse pattern. And this method also introduces a novel hardware-aware learning object to reduce the power consumption during inference.

### Strengths
* The proposed block-structured sparse method can be a good trade-off for the model accuracy and the FLOPs reduction.

### Weaknesses
* This method is only applied to the linear layers in vision transformers. However, the multi-head attentions in the model also take a large proportion of the FLOPs, especially for the inputs with large sizes. 
* The power consumption only considers the matrix multiplication operations, which is inaccurate because the memory accesses take a large proportion of energy consumption. The performance of vision transformers is usually bounded by the memory accesses, especially for those edge devices. So memory accesses should also be taken into account.  
* The experiments are only conducted on the DeiT models, which use global attention. It is better to conduct more experiments on other vision transformer models, such as the Swin Transformer, which has been widely used nowadays.
* Experiments are insufficient. The authors only evaluate the proposed method on the classification task. It is better to discuss the generalization of the method and evaluate different tasks.
* Only show the FLOPs reduction, without the real speedup. Even with the adoption of block-wise sparsity, there is still some overhead during inference, especially for the sparse model with small block shapes. If the paper can show the real speedup, it will be more convincing.

### Questions
* As for the estimated power consumption, i.e., eq. 7, when used this to constrain the power consumption, as shown in eq. 8, what’s the difference with the direct constraint on the FLOPs? It seems like an additional parameter $p_m$ has been added to the FLOPs constraint.
* Were all the experiments fine-tuned for 300 epochs? If that is the case, it should not be referred to as a post-training method, as illustrated in the abstract. In addition, it is unfair to compare the baseline in Table 1. The baseline in Table 1 is not training with the knowledge distillation, but the LSP models are fine-tuned with 300 epochs with knowledge distillation. And the accuracy of the distilled DeiT-Small and DeiT-Base should be 81.2% and 83.4%, respectively.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel ViTs weight pruning algorithm dedicated to cut off energy consumption of inference by taking advantage of the characteristics of the ViT architecture, which mostly constructed by linear layers and proposed to use semi-structured (block-sparsity) pruning scheme to bridge the gap between fine-tuning stability and hardware friendliness.

### Strengths
1.	This paper introduces an optimal hardware-aware pruning objective designed for ViTs models within the block-structured pruning scheme.

2.	The proposed framework offers an efficient solution for the hardware-aware objective function through the use of a second-order Taylor approximation. It also introduces an empirical optimization method with a linear time complexity, providing a practical and effective approach.

### Weaknesses
1.	It seems like the block size is the same throughout the whole pruning process. If it is possible that the block size can be different at each layer, this may provide a more flexible pattern.

2.	At a certain Flops constraint, the layer-wise sparsity is computed by the proposed method. I would like to know the accuracy of the proposed method versus the traditional uniform approach for the same flops budget.

3.	How does the sparsity distribution vary according to different layers? Does the distribution show similar pattern among different models and Flops budgets?

4.	How is the performance of the Swin transformer?

5.	It would be great to show some visual results (e.g., attention maps) to prove the effectiveness when compared with other methods.

Is the novelty mainly for the combination of block pruning with ViTs? If so, what is the main challenge and novelty compared with the previous block pruning work? If the hardware-aware strategy is the main contribution, where are the corresponding hardware configuration results?
3. Only two Deit models are incorporated into the experiments. Not sure about the method's flexibility.
