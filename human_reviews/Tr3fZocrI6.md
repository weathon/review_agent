## Abstract
A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$
from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic meta-learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias}$ & $\texttt{Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent (AMD) scheme proposed in Collins et al., (2021), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data.
Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.

### Summary
The authors study the problem of linear representation in a multi-task regression setting. As a starting point, they use an alternating minimization procedure (AMD) developed in prior works on the same problem. They showed empirically that this procedure can fail to learn the correct representation when there is noise in the observations or non-isotropic covariates, even when the different tasks are identical, and gave a theoretical explanation for the sources of error. Based on their analysis, they propose a modification to the alternating minimization procedure (dubbed DFW) which can handle noisy observations and non-isotropic covariates, and experiments confirm the efficacy of their modification.

### Strengths
**Clarity of exposition.** The paper is very well written and easy to follow. The authors give extensive interpretation of their results which greatly contributed to my understanding of the paper. The precise relationship to previous work is made explicit, so readers unfamiliar with this sub-field can still parse the paper and understand its contribution easily.

**Intuitive and well-motivated algorithm.** The shortcomings of the base algorithm (AMD) are explained clearly, as are the modifications the authors proposed in DFW, making for an intuitive algorithm. The modifications are simple, easy to implement, and obtain near optimal sample complexity rates.

**Technical contribution.** The authors remove strong technical assumptions found in previous work. They show both theoretically and empirically that these strong assumptions are necessary for AMD to succeed, and are not merely artifacts of previous proofs. Their results are strong both statistically (obtaining optimal sample complexity) and algorithmically (not requiring access to optimization oracles for non-convex problems, which were assumed in some previous works). Their algorithm is also constructed in such a way that data does not need to be shared in its explicit form across tasks, making it attractive when data privacy is a concern. (Remark: It is unclear if the representation _updates_ from each task will still leak private information, but anyway this is not the main focus of the paper.)

### Weaknesses
**Theory.** While the assumptions are much weaker than those in related works, some of the assumptions are still very strong. Two in particular stand out.
1. The representation dimension $r$ is required to be at most $\min(d_x, d_y)$, where $d_x$ is the dimension of the covariates and $d_y$ is the dimension of the observations (Section 2, just after equation (1)). In the linear regression setting, this would mean that there must be a one-dimensional representation. This is a very strong assumption. It seems like we should still be able to obtain some benefit if the representation only has a lower dimension than the _covariates_. This would more closely mirror practical settings such as e.g. computer vision, where the data are assumed to belong to a lower-dimensional manifold.
2. Assumption 3.1: It is assumed that the $\beta$-mixing coefficient follows an _exact_ geometric decay, i.e., $\beta^{(t)}(k) = \Gamma^{(t)} \mu^{(t)k}$ for each task $t$. This should place strong restrictions on the possible types of covariate trajectory distributions. It seems like we should expect the results if the decay is _at least_ geometric in nature, i.e., $\beta(k) \leq \Gamma \mu^k$ for some $\mu < 1$.

**Experiments.** The empirical results would be more convincing at showing a fundamental limit on the accuracy for AMD if final accuracy vs. number of tasks was shown at a fixed sample size per task, and showing that this accuracy does not approach 0 as the number of tasks increases. At present, it is just shown for T=25. While DFW does converge in this scenario, in principle, it could just be that DFW has a better sample complexity, but AMD will still eventually converge given enough tasks, albeit at a slower rate. Adding this experiment would strengthen the paper.

A minor point: the title of the OpenReview submission does not match the title on the paper. This should be fixed.

### Questions
1. I am curious why the required number of samples $N$ grows (moderately) with the number of tasks $T$. I assume this is to enforce some sort of uniform bound on the random fluctuations across all of the tasks. Can the authors confirm if this intuition is correct?

2. Is there some intuition for why the representation dimension $r$ must be smaller than both the covariate _and_ measurement dimensions? If this is a necessary assumption, can the authors comment on how they would justify this restriction, especially in the linear regression case when $d_y=1$?

3. In Definition 3.1, is there an implicit assumption that the stationary distribution $\nu_\infty$ exists, or are there some conditions imposed on the covariate trajectory distributions which guarantee that a stationary distribution will exist as a consequence?

4. Do the results still hold if the equality for $\beta(k)$ in Assumption 3.1 is replaced with an inequality?

5. It is very interesting that the use of an MLP allows the original AMD algorithm to overcome the fundamental lower bound on the error present when learning a linear representation (even if the sample complexity is much worse than DFW). Is this just because the quantity being measured (validation loss instead of subspace distance) is different, or would AMD with a linear representation fail to converge to 0 validation loss in this setting? If this is particular to the MLP representation, do the authors have any intuition for why this might be the case?

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm about learning the representation is a linear connection between feature and labels. The algorithm is based on gradient descent and QR decomposition on the iterates. The paper further proves a bound about the sample complexity and error of the algorithm, which is optimal in terms of problem parameters (degree of freedom). Numerical experiments validates the performance of the algorithm.

### Strengths
This paper proposes A practical and simple algorithm, and the theories as well as the math proof of the sample complexity (per batch and in total) and error are solid in terms of the degree of the freedom. The logic and the writing is clear. 
Especially, Remark 3.2 is great where we can see that the lower bound of $N$ makes sense. Some other papers, although claiming optimality with respect to total samples $NT$, there is a strong assumption on lower bound $N$ that makes them trival, e.g., Du et al.

### Weaknesses
On the other hand, does Tripuraneni et al. work when $N = O(1)$? This paper assumes $N = \Omega(r)$ so there is still a gap from the optimum. The result in this paper is still good because $r$ it's a small number in low rank setting which we are interested in, and it is already better than the papers listed in Remark 3.2. But it would be great to propose why this paper cannot achieve $N = O(1)$. 

Since this paper discusses general feature covariances, it would be great to talk more about the impact of the spectrum of the covariance matrix. There are a few papers about how the feature and operator covariances’ spectrums show up in the bound, and how the "aligned" covariances help learning, for example,

Wu and Xu, On the Optimal Weighted $\ell_2$ Regularization in Overparameterized Linear Regression

And a few relevant ones. 

It would be great to have a notation table, either in main text or appendix, because there are many different notations/definitions.

### Summary
This paper points out a failed example of traditional algorithms in handling non-isotropic data. To overcome this issue, it proposes an algorithm called De-bias & Feature-Whiten (DFW) for multi-task linear representation learning from non-iid and non-isotropic data. DFW provably recovers the optimal shared representation at a rate that scales favorably with the number of tasks and data samples per task. Numerical verification is also provided to validate the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
Regarding the originality, few meta- federated- learning papers are working on non-iid settings. So this paper has its own novelty.  

The paper is also well-structured and clearly states the necessary backgrounds, though some technical details should be further extended.

The example on the non-IID non-isotropic data provides a clear motivation of proposing a new algorithm to overcome this issue. It indicates parts of significance of this work.

### Weaknesses
The title "META-LEARNING OPERATORS TO OPTIMALITY FROM MULTI-TASK NON-IID DATA" is so vague. It is really hard to understand what this paper studies from the title. It should indicate that the goal is to learn the shared parameter $\Phi$.

The failed example given in Section 3.1 serves as the main motivation of introducing new algorithms. However, these two crucial issues in this example are not really resolved. I am concerned if the de-bias and feature-whiten steps could really resolve these issues. I put more comments in the next section.

### Questions
1. First about clarifying the key idea de-bias and feature-whiten methods. In Section 3.2, it says that $\hat{F}^{(t)}$ is computed on independent data. It is not clear to me why $\hat{F}^{(t)}$ is independent from $X^{(t)}$.  To my understanding, for example, the Partition trajectories step (Line 5, Algorithm 1) splits the dataset $N$ to $N_{1}=\\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \\}$ and $N_{2}=\\{x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, \dots, x_{n+N} \\}$. But they come from the same $\beta$-mixing stochastic process, will they become independent?

2. What is "the aforementioned batching strategy" mentioned in Section 3.2 right after Eq.(5)? It seems that there is no batching strategy mentioned before. 

3. The proof for the non-iid case simply says after taking the "blocking technique on each trajectory", everything is same as the iid case. First, what is the "blocking technique on each trajectory"? Has this technique been introduced before? 

4. Then regarding the proof for the non-iid case, I am mainly concerned if the iid case could be simply immigrated to the non-iid case. For example, on page 16 of the supplimentary material, it says "We observe that since $\hat{F}(t)$ is by construction independent of ... " and obtains $$E[FWX\Sigma^{-1}]=E[F]E[W]E[X\Sigma^{-1}]$$
This equation won't hold for the non-iid case. It is because $F$ here is evaluated using a part of the process $\{x\}$ and $\Sigma$ is estimated using another part of the same process.

### Summary
In "Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data" proposes a scheme and statistical guarantees to problems stemming from multi-task learning. In this setting, prior works focused on i.i.d. and isotropic data while the proposed work allows for non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic data. In order to design the scheme and provide with statistical guarantees, in which learning all tasks jointly implies a statistical gain, the authors modify a proposed scheme for the i.i.d. and isotropic data by including mini-batches and whitening.

The obtained results are what is expected in terms of statistical precision, given the total number of samples, tasks and problem dimension.

### Strengths
The paper is overall well written, and I think the result is good enough. While a criticism can be put forth in that it combines existing known techniques to establish the final result, it is not necessarily obvious that the combination yields the desired statistical result.

### Weaknesses
I am overall happy with the paper. I think the authors did a good job at presenting their work. I mainly have two questions/weaknesess. The result provided by the authors requires a minimum number of samples under which contraction upto a ball of the alignment of the estimated and optimal subspace are. Is there any sense to how tight this bound is from an information theoretical sense, i.e. the scaling with gamma, mu, etc? 

Second, in corollary 3.1. the authors establish the existence of a partition of independent batches that guarantees this result. Can it be guaranteed that such partition is found in practice?
