## Abstract
Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm in which an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with efficient sample complexity. Additionally, we investigate reward-agnostic RL with action-based comparison feedback and introduce an efficient querying algorithm tailored to this scenario.

### Summary
This paper deals with Preference-based RL (PbRL), a framework in which the learning agent collects a pair of trajectories and asks an external evaluator which one is better. Differently from previous works, this paper proposes to decouple the exploration of the environment, which is done through a reward-free oracle, and the active learning of the reward, by querying the external evaluators on previously collected trajectory pairs. Specifically, the paper provides (i) new algorithms implementing this framework for PbRL in both tabular and linear MDPs, which are called REGIME and REGIME-lin respectively, (ii) the analysis of the sample complexity of the latter algorithms, (iii) an alternative feedback model in which the external evaluator provides preferences over action pairs, together with a corresponding algorithm variation that is called REGIME-action.

### Strengths
- (Originality) To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper providing sample complexity results for PbRL with an algorithm specifically designed for the PAC setting instead of regret minimization;
- (Significance) As the authors argue in the paper, their framework where exploration and feedback collection are decoupled can suit better some important applications;
- (Quality) Although I did not checked the derivations in details, the reported results and the considered assumptions look reasonable;
- (Clarity) The paper is well presented and clear, even if some comparison with previous works seem overstretched.

### Weaknesses
- (Worst-case complexity) All of the reported results on trajectory-preference feedback come with the huge caveat that the rate may be exponential in the worst-case, as $r_{\text{max}}$ can be as large as $H$;
- (Lower bound) The paper does not provide a lower bound on the sample complexity, which makes unclear whether the reported factors are actually unavoidable (especially in $\kappa$ as the necessity of $|\mathcal{S}|^2 |\mathcal{A}|$ cannot be overcome due to the reward-free oracle).

GENERAL COMMENT

This looks like an interesting paper addressing a relevant problem, which is gaining additional traction given the recent success of RL from human feedback. I found the claim of improved results w.r.t. prior works (e.g., Pacchiano et al., 2021) to be a little overstated: Previous works target regret minimization instead of sample complexity, which arguably makes the comparison spurious. Whereas it is important to show that REGIME improves their sample complexity rate, it is unclear whether the regret can also be bounded, which would result in a worse fit for online settings. Having said that, both the online settings and the online exploration/offline feedback collection look reasonable to me, hence the results in this paper are valuable. For this reason, I am currently providing a slightly positive evaluation, but I am open to increase my score after a deeper inspection of the analysis possibly revealing interesting techniques, and a convincing authors' response on the questions below.

### Questions
1) While it is widely known that Markovian policies are sufficient to maximize a reward function, it comes as a surprise history-dependent policies are not considered although the feedback is based on full trajectories. I guess this might be a consequence of the linear reward assumption. Can the authors develop on why Markovian policies are sufficient to actively generate trajectories for the feedback collection step?

2) In the Preliminaries section, the paper claims that "it is necessary to make structural assumptions about the reward". Do the authors mean that the problem is not learnable without the linear reward assumption, or that *some* structural assumption is needed? Providing a lower bound would be clarifying of course.
 
3) Related to the previous question, one may wonder whether assuming an underlying reward function is really necessary for PbRL. Can the problem be cast as a direct maximization of the human feedback instead?

4) The action-based preference feedback looks somehow related to inverse RL, where the learner can query an expert on the optimal action for a given state rather than a preference between a pair of actions. Can the authors relate their findings with previous inverse RL literature? Do they think their problem is easier/harder than inverse RL?

5) Can the authors discuss the novelty of their sample complexity analysis w.r.t. prior work? Is there any novel technique they would like to highlight?

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors introduce an algorithm for PbRL, that collects trajectories and preference feedback only in an initial phase and not iteratively. Assuming a linear reward function and an epsilon-exact transition function estimator, they show a novel sample-complexity analysis. This approach is also extended to a linear MDP setting, where it is possible to forgo the requirement of an transition function estimator and directly approximate a policies feature space. They also show a complexity analysis that is independent of $r_{max}$.

### Strengths
The authors consider a relevant problem, which relates to a commonly used variant of PbRL (non-interactive). The given assumptions are reasonable under for many real world scenarios. Linear rewards can usually be achieved with suitable projections and epsilon-exact transition function approximators are also available in several domains. Therefore, the complexity analysis is potentially applicable to a wide range of problems, rendering the work significant. The work is also original, as the authors deviate from the common, reward-based scheme.
Clarity could be slightly improved, as explained in the following.

### Weaknesses
The most substantial weakness of the contribution, is its substantial dependence on the appendix. It is acceptable to move specific details, like a formal proof, to the supplementary, but the main paper should be able to stand on its own. This mostly concerns Theorem 1, which is not sufficiently explained in the main paper. At least the basic idea/concept should be added. Furthermore, Algorithm 4/5 are direct references to the supplementary material.

On a side note, the relation to $\hat{P}$ and the related approximation error is not obvious from the used notation, because the dependence is missing from line 5 (and14) of Algorithm 1.

### Summary
This paper studies Preference-based RL (PbRL) for tabular, linear, and low-rank MDPs. The authors focus on designing PAC algorithms and prove sample complexity guarantees for all proposed algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithms separate the trajectory selection stage and human feedback stage, which could be very useful in applications since all the human feedback can be queried in a single batch. Finally, the authors also extend their algorithms to action-based comparisons.

### Strengths
- The studied problem of PAC PbRL is interesting and hasn't been studied much before.  
- As far as I can tell, the contributions of this paper are novel and significant in that (a) the algorithms attain better sample complexity and (b) are arguably more practical by seperating the trajectory collection and human feedback stages.  
- A main strength of the porposed algorithms is that all the sampling of exploratory trajcetories is done first and only then human comparisons queried.

### Weaknesses
- I think that the presentation can be improved. I know that space limitations are tight, however, removing margins around equations and sections will make the paper much harder to read. A table which compares this paper's results with related work would also help the reader to place this work into the existing literature. This would be particularly helpful since much of the related work does not study PAC algorithms, but only regret minimization, and it is difficult to figure out the current state-of-the-art and open questions in this area from just reading the paper.

### Questions
- At the end of Section 3, you compare to Pacchiano et al. (2021). I suppose that the stated sample complexities are for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-PAC and the dependence on $\delta$ omitted? I'm also slightly confused because the referenced Theorem 2 in Pacchiano et al. (2021) only provides a regret upper bound. Where did you find the PAC bound?  
- How computationally expensive is step 1 (e.g., line 5 in Algorithm 1, line 7 in Algorithm 2, line 5 in Algorithm 3)? 
- How do you think will your algorithms perform in practice? Do you anticipate any obstacles when deploying your algorithms (computational or otherwise)? 
- Intuitively, one would think that adaptive trajectory selection which queries human feedback after every selection would be advantageous compared to first selecting all trajectories without observing intermediate human feedback. In other words, you would expect *adaptive* experimental design to perform better than *offline* experimental design (even when it comes to PAC learning). Your results however suggest that "offline" trajectory selection does not hurt performance. Can you provide any reasons or intuition for this? 
- Hereto related, do you think that your approach of seperating trajectory selection and human feedback stages is applicable/useful for regret minimization as well? (Beyond trivially reducing your $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-PAC guarantees to regret bounds via some explore-then-commit strategy).

### Summary
This paper studies online reward-agnostic Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) with linear reward functions, which aims at learning a near-optimal policy with human preferences as feedback. This setting is different from current literature of online PbRL in that the humans are able to get rid of online preferences labeling in the exploration on-the-fly, instead they label the exploratory trajectories after they are complete collected. The paper provides sample efficient algorithms with different reward-agnostic setup: when a model-based reward-free exploration oracle is given, or when the underlying model is linear MDP or low-rank MDP. The theoretical algorithms are complemented with polynomial sample complexity in terms of the MDP parameters and $\epsilon$. Moreover, the sample complexity can be reduce to $O(\exp(B_{\mathrm{adv}}))$ where $B_{\mathrm{adv}}$ is the $l_\infty$ norm of the optimal advantage function when action-wise preference in terms of the optimal Q function is provided instead of trajectory-wise preference.

### Strengths
PbRL and RLHF are highly related to important practical problems such as tuning large models, and they are also proved to be one of the key designs in the success of LLMs. Therefore, the importance of studying the theoretical information provided by human preference data is significant.

### Weaknesses
1. Since the motivation of this work derives from prominent practical problems, the results seem to be limited to guide the use of PbRL of RLHF in real-world problems. Although the results show a reduction of the number of human preference data compared to previous work by collecting a exploratory dataset in advance, it is doubtful whether the algorithmic designs are computational efficient to be implemented to improve the RLHF. Some experiment results (even on toy examples) are appreciated to show the effectiveness of decoupling the human labeling process and online exploration stage. The significance of the results cannot be fully verified without the proof of practical usage of these algorithmic designs, because the proposed algorithms may be computational inefficient, thus explaining the theoretical advantage of such algorithms rarely helps to explain the advantage of current PbRL used in practice.

2. The setting looks like a combination of reward-free exploration and online PbRL, which are both standard in reinforcement learning and extensively studied. Therefore, it is hard to evaluate the technical contributions as a theoretical work. The subroutine to collect exploratory data with linear reward functions (using whether reward-free exploration oracle or linear reward-free exploration subroutine) used for human preferences, the MLE estimation of the underlying reward model, and the planning of the optimal policy seem to be slight modification of standard algorithms in the literature, as long as the proving tools. I recommend to explicitly explain the technical contributions in the paper.

### Questions
The previous work Pacchiano et al. studied the online PbRL with a linear reward function. It seems that the sample complexity of this in the reward-free exploratory stage is better than that of the previous work, which is not reward-free setting. What causes this gap between current work and previous work?
