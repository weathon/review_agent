## Abstract
State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutation framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance.

### Summary
This paper discusses a setting where a representation function $\phi(X)$, (a generalization of propensity score $\pi(X)$), is available while part of X is unobservable. That is, instead of following the typical approach of choosing X from only observables (expecting $\phi(X)$ to be a balancing score) and discussing the potential effects of unobservable covariates, they follow the approach of considering X as all covariates including even unobservable covariates. At the same time, they assume that $\phi(X)$ value is available (while part of X is not observable)

In the typical approach, when we cannot assume that $\phi(X)$ is a balancing score, we may suffer confounding bias. In the exact same way in their approach, when we cannot assume that $\phi(X)$ (in their case it is called the representation function) includes enough information about unobservable covariates, we may suffer a bias. (in their case it is called the representation-induced confounding bias or RICB)

The authors identify RICB, and propose a technique to estimate the bound.
Comprehensive simulation studies were followed.

Title: "2021 NeurIPS paper ... assumes that all confounders are X" is what I am saying.

Hi Alicia,

Thank you for participating in the discussion.
Yes, your paper assumes that all confounders are included in X, which is observed. This is your paper's assumption 1, which states that there are no unobserved confounders.

On the other hand, this paper's setting is different. 
I quote myself above:
"This paper discusses a setting where a representation function $\phi(X)$, (a generalization of propensity score $\pi(X)$), is available while part of X is unobservable. That is, instead of following the typical approach of choosing X from only observables (expecting $\phi(X)$ to be a balancing score) and discussing the potential effects of unobservable covariates, they follow the approach of considering X as all covariates including even unobservable covariates. At the same time, they assume that $\phi(X)$ value is available (while part of X is not observable)"

My concern is that, the authors are saying that their setting is making a typical assumption (which is not true) and then citing your work as the one of the works that make typical assumption (which is true). 

Thanks,
Reviewer FevT.

Hi Alicia,

I understand what you are saying - I think what AC pointed out is correct. 
I modified my score, as I have no further concerns. 

Thank you very much again for participating in the discussion.

Many thanks,
Reviewer FevT

### Strengths
Simulation studies are quite comprehensive.
Theoretical bounds has been proposed. 
The paper is very well written. It was pleasant to read.

### Weaknesses
\textbf{1. Motivation of their approach}

As discussed in the Summary part of this review, for me it was hard to understand why we need a new approach of choosing X. The concept of RICB is, in essence, equivalent to confounder bias but formulated in a different choice of X. For example, in the traditional way of choosing X as only unobservables and talking about $\phi(X)$ not being a balancing score, potential effect of unobservable covariates not being included as X can be discussed. So I am not sure about the potential benefit of choosing X to include unobservable covariates.

\textbf{2. Bounds}
Theoretical bounds provided should be appreciated, but I cannot be sure how strong this theoretical bound is only from current version of the manuscript.

### Questions
In terms of Weakness 1: Could you please give a clear motivation of choosing X to include unobservable but considering $\phi(X)$ as observable, and then reframing the confounder bias we know as RICB in the newly proposed setting? Does the fact that we are dealing with representation learning make some difference? I just want to try to understand.

In terms of Weakness 2: How tight is the bound for some popular special cases, especially for the settings you did your experiment? Are they practically good?

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of confounding bias induced by learning representation of confounder for CATE estimation. The authors proposed a framework for estimating bounds on the induced confounding bias. A neural framework is used to compute the bounds.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a problem that is novel and related to the representation of learning for CATE, which is a prominent research direction.
- A detailed analysis of representation-induced bias is provided.
- Both real-world and synthetic experiments are performed with the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses
- The motivation for employing CDAG is not quite clear. 
- No theoretical proof of the proposed bounds.

### Questions
- Could you provide some intuition about learning the representation of all the covariates together instead of the confounder?
- If learning representation of covariates inducing bias is unavoidable, how does the bias compare with bias due to finite-sample? e.g., How does it compare with the non-representation learning approach?

### Summary
Estimating conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation widely uses low-dimensional representation learning, which can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias.
In this paper, the authors propose a new framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias (RICB). To summarize, the contributions are three-fold:
1.	CATE from representation learning methods can be non-identifiable due to RICB.
2.	The authors propose a representation-agnostic framework to perform partial identification of CATE.
3.	The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds together with a wide range of state-of-the-art CATE methods.

### Strengths
The paper is technically sound and well-organized.

### Weaknesses
It seems that the notations/symbols are not defined correctly. For example, in the section of notations, the authors claim that $\mu_a^x(x)=\mathbb{E}(Y|A=1,X=x)$, but $\mu_a^x(x)$ should be $\mathbb{E}(Y|A=a,X=x)$. In the same paragraph, the authors claim that $\mu_a^\phi(\phi)=\mathbb{E}(Y|A=1,\Phi(X)=\phi)$, but $\mu_a^\phi(\phi)$ should be $\mathbb{E}(Y|A=a,\Phi(X)=\phi)$. In addition, the authors define $\pi_a^x(x)= \mathbb{P}(A=a|X=x)$. I wonder why the authors do not simply $\pi_a^x$ or $\pi_a(x)$. Problem arises when the authors introduce overlap assumption. The authors claim that $\mathbb{P}(0<\pi_a^x(X)<1)=1$, but I cannot obtain $\pi_a^x(X)$ from the definition. Indeed, in the definition of $\pi_a^x(x)= \mathbb{P}(A=a|X=x)$, The two “x”s in $\pi_a^x(x)$ should be mapped to “x” in $\mathbb{P}(A=a|X=x)$. Nevertheless, when $\pi_a^x(x)$ is changed to $\pi_a^x(X)$ or $\pi_a^X(x)$, the mapping procedure is not clear.

### Questions
1. According to the definition of $X$, $X=\{X^\emptyset,X^a,X^y,X^\bigtriangleup\}$. At the same time, $X$ is independent of $X^\emptyset$, $X^a$, $X^y$ ,$X^\bigtriangleup$ conditioning to $\Phi(X)$. It is strange to claim Eqn. (4).
2. In the example “Representations with removed noise and instruments”, the authors claim that under Eqn. (5), the validity follows from the d-separation in clustered casual diagram and Appendix B. In appendix B, only investigations related to the example “Invertible representations” are presented.
3. I suspect the equality of $\mathbb{E}(Y[1]-Y[0]|X=x)=\mathbb{E}(Y[1]-Y[0]|X^\bigtriangleup=x^\bigtriangleup, X^y=x^y)$ and $\mathbb{E}(Y[1]-Y[0]|X^\bigtriangleup=x^\bigtriangleup, X^y=x^y)= \mathbb{E}(Y[1]-Y[0]|\Phi(X)=\Phi(x) $ in Eqn. (6) under Eqn. (5). Could the authors provide more details?

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of induced confounding that occurs in neural network based conditional average treatment effect estimation as a result of representation learning that operates over a lossy reduced dimension embedding. The authors propose to account for the confounding by leveraging sensitivity analysis. In particular the authors use the marginal sensitivity model and provide bounds on the CATE. A framework is then introduced to estimate the proposed bound within a neural network training flow. A set of experiments are provided which validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
This paper addresses a very important, and often overlooked, aspect of representation learning for causal effect estimation. The authors do a commendable job of describing the circumstances under which we should expect to incur bias due to representation induced confounding, and clearly delineate them from existing approaches which don't suffer from the same issues. The proposed sensitivity analysis is intuitive and the authors do a nice job of describing it's integration into the neural network training process.

### Weaknesses
The largest weakness I see is the same as what is commonly shared throughout the sensitivity analysis literature, namely that practitioners must place assumptions on the extent of confounding.

### Questions
Given the relative difficulty of CATE estimation in small sample regimes, as the authors point to, it would seem that there are a number of settings where representation based CATE estimation is inappropriate. Given this it would be useful for the authors to compare the bounds provided here and contrast to non-NN based approaches (e.g., BART / causal forests) to give a sense of the relative loss in precision due to the representation induced confounding.
