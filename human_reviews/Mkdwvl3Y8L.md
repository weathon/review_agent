## Abstract
Pretrained language models (LMs) encode implicit representations of knowledge in their parameters. However, localizing these representations and disentangling them from each other remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate whether pretrained language models contain various *knowledge-critical* subnetworks: particular sparse computational subgraphs responsible for encoding specific knowledge the model has memorized. We propose a multi-objective differentiable weight masking scheme to discover these subnetworks and show that we can use them to precisely remove specific knowledge from models while minimizing adverse effects on the behavior of the original language model. We demonstrate our method on multiple GPT2 variants, uncovering highly sparse subnetworks (98\%+) that are solely responsible for specific collections of relational knowledge. When these subnetworks are removed, the remaining network maintains most of its initial capacity (modeling language and other memorized relational knowledge) but struggles to express the removed knowledge, and suffers performance drops on examples needing this removed knowledge on downstream tasks after finetuning.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use a differentiable weight masking strategy to find subnetworks within pretrained language models that are critical for encoding specific knowledge. It is demonstrated that such subnetworks are highly sparse, and removing such subnetworks can selectively remove certain triplet knowledge without significantly affecting other knowledge and general language abilities in the model. The paper also shows that the knowledge-critical subnetworks determine the model's utilization of knowledge in downstream tasks.

### Strengths
* The authors introduce a novel method for finding subnetworks in large language models responsible for encoding specific knowledge, and demonstrate that it effectively finds highly-sparse subnetworks that are specific to a given set of knowledge.

* The paper uses analysis from different dimensions to verify the causal effect of the knowledge-critical subnetwork on the selected knowledge, including ablation study, expansion of the mask, and performance on downstream tasks controlled for the selected knowledge. The results strengthen the conclusion that the knowledge-critical subnetwork has a causal effect on the storage and expression of knowledge.

* The paper is well-written, well-structured and very accessible to the readers. 

* The existence of knowledge-critical subnetworks may have significant implications on the interpretability of pretrained language models and could guide future research in the field. Future research may be able to explore how these subnetworks can be adapted, potentially leading to more efficient model fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
* The effectiveness of knowledge removal is not quite clear due to limited metrics: the paper mainly uses "perplexity increase on verbalized triplet prompts" as a measure of knowledge removal but does not provide a solid interpretation of this metric. For example, one does not know how much perplexity increase corresponds to a complete (or near-complete) removal of the knowledge. Therefore, it may be hard to evaluate whether knowledge is truly removed with this metric alone. Also, there is a possibility that the perplexity drop is specific to the verbalizing template, so it may be helpful to evaluate on different templates as well.

  Perhaps knowledge-centric question-answering benchmarks, like those used in Section 6.4, could provide more interpretable results. However, the results currently presented in Section 6.4 also fail to prove reliable removal of knowledge, as pruning knowledge subnetworks only results in a small decrease in performance (3-4%).

* The effectiveness of knowledge preservation is also unclear due to possible overfit: the loss function is designed to preserve performance on ControlKG and ControlLM, and results show a negligible decrease in performance on them. However, it is possible that besides removing knowledge in TargetKG, the pruned model also sacrifices some other knowledge that is not in ControlKG and ControlLM. This would go against the goal of finding subnetworks specific to TargetKG. To rule out this possibility, the pruned model should be evaluated on a separate KG and a different corpus than those used in the loss function to make sure that the maintenance criterion is not overfitted to ControlKG and ControlLM.

* Lack of analysis on the discovered knowledge subnetworks

  * On sparsity: how sparse is truly sparse for a knowledge-critical subnetwork? If there are only 10-20 triplets in TargetKG, then 99% sparsity (~1M parameter for GPT2-small) does not seem very sparse, because it's unlikely that the model truly uses 1M parameter to store 10-20 triplets. I would personally expect a much higher sparsity (e.g., 99.99%) for a knowledge-critical subnetwork of 10-20 triplets, as a pre-trained language model typically stores a vast amount of knowledge.
  * On specificity: one way to examine the specificity of the subnetwork could be comparing the subnetwork for two different groups of triplets. If the subnetworks are largely different, it will provide evidence that the subnetworks are specific to the selected knowledge.
  * On trading-off suppression and maintenance: for two competing goals like suppression and maintenance, there is usually a tradeoff rather than a single best solution. It may be helpful to show this tradeoff by varying the weights in Equation 6, and it could also give justification for the choice of the weights.

### Questions
* On model choice: GPT2 is a slightly outdated model, recent models such as LLaMA are much better at knowledge tasks and may provide more statistically significant results.
* It's probably better to list some basic statistics of TargetKG, ControlKG, and ControlLM in the main text as they can be important for interpreting the results (e.g., sparsity).
* How does the expression criteria in Section 6.2 differ from the suppression criteria? It seems that Equation 7 is (approximately) just the reverse of Equation 3.

### Summary
This paper investigates the presence of knowledge-critical subnetworks in pretrained language models (LMs) and proposes a method to discover and remove these subnetworks while minimizing adverse effects on the behavior of the original model.  Overall, the paper presents a novel approach for discovering knowledge-critical subnetworks in pretrained language models. However, further evaluation and comparison with existing methods, as well as addressing the mentioned weaknesses and clarifying the typos, would strengthen the paper's contribution.

### Strengths
1. Novel approach for discovering knowledge-critical subnetworks: The paper introduces a differentiable weight masking scheme that allows for the identification of subnetworks responsible for encoding specific knowledge in pretrained language models. This approach provides insights into how knowledge is encoded and can be potentially useful for model editing and finetuning.

2. Analysis of seed-based variance and subnetwork composition: The paper investigates the stability of subnetwork discovery under seed-based variance and explores the composition of subnetworks from different seeds. This analysis adds valuable insights into the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of comparison with other existing methods: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other existing methods for discovering knowledge-critical subnetworks in pretrained language models. This makes it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.

2. Limited evaluation on downstream tasks: The paper primarily focuses on the discovery of knowledge-critical subnetworks but lacks a thorough evaluation of the impact of these subnetworks on downstream tasks. It would be beneficial to include experiments that demonstrate the effect of subnetwork removal on various NLP tasks.

### Questions
1. How does the proposed differentiable weight masking scheme compare to other existing methods for discovering knowledge-critical subnetworks in pretrained language models?

2. Can the discovered knowledge-critical subnetworks be used for targeted model editing or finetuning to improve specific task performance?

3. Can you provide more details about the filtering processes applied to the sampled connected KGs? How did these processes ensure the quality and balance of the sampled graphs?

4. How did you validate the effectiveness of the discovered subnetworks in suppressing the expression of target knowledge triplets?

### Summary
The paper argues that language models contain sparse subnetworks of parameters that are critical for expressing specific knowledge relationships. The authors then use an existing selected-pruning method to identify these "knowledge-critical" subnetworks: learning a binary mask over the parameters. They propose to optimise the binary mask jointly with three objectives 1) suppressing the expression of target knowledge triplets when the subnetwork is removed 2) maintaining performance on other knowledge triplets of a predefined KG and language modeling 3) sparsity regularizer as most work on pruning. 

Experiments on GPT-2 variants find highly sparse subnetworks of  ~98% sparsity, which is similar as most sparsity work using hard concrete.  Interestingly, the authors show that, removing the subnetworks significantly reduce the model's ability to express the associated knowledge, but maintain other capacities, indicating a certain level of controllability over the specific knowledge.

### Strengths
- The authors address a very timely problem -- identify LLM subnetworks that correspond to certain knowledge and manipulate over the subnetworks to control the access of the knowledge.
- The authors propose a sensible approach for tackle the problem. Empirical experiments over GPT-2 show consistent trends in different datasets.

### Weaknesses
I think the paper can be improved in the following aspects:
- Lack of Meaningful Metrics. 
    - The authors are showing the sparsity level over the masked parameters. Therefore 98% sparsity does not mean 98% of parameters in LLMs are not used. It would be more clear if the authors display the real sparsity levels.
    - The authors only use PPL to measure the effectiveness of their method. However, the ppl values can be a bit confusing as its range can be very big. Would it more sensible to use ranking metrics? for example, the rank of the target entity token?
- Lack of ablation studies
    - ablation on sparsity levels. does varying the sparsity level from 98% to 20% or 60% change the conclusion? 
    - pruning methods based on hard concrete are usually sensitive to hyper-parameters. do you have any hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis?
- Limited baselines. 
    - The only baseline is random masking of the maskable parameters, which is no surprise working poorly. The random baseline has no access to either TargetKG or ControlKG. It seems unfair to compare it with the proposed method if it uses much less information.

### Questions
- Does your method generalise to other pretrained language models?
- What's the computational complexity of the proposed method? Can it generalise to 7B parameter model [1]?
- What are the computational infrastructure for your experiments? If the readers want to reproduce your results, how many GPUs do they need?
- Prior research show that the embedding layer might contain lots of redundancy as the tokens follow long-tailed distribution. If you want to achieve high sparsity, pruning the embeddings can be a good choice. At the same time, the embeddings can be very informative. One simple baseline to remove a certain knowledge would be just erasing entity-related token embeddings. Why this is not one of your baseline?
- Does combining two knowledge-critical subnetworks lead to suppress of both pieces of knowledge?
- Does predicting missing entity fully represent this knowledge triplet? I am not sure. Even if it can correctly predict the missing entity, the prediction might be only based on the (subject, object) pair instead of based on the specific relation. In general, a knowledge triplet can be rephrased in multiple ways, eg. swapping the order of subject and object, missing relation prediction [2] etc. Can the proposed method can deal with the various rephrasing of a certain knowledge?

### Summary
This paper explores a method for detecting and zeroing-out the parameters of an LLM which contain knowledge relevant to a specific topic. Such masks are posited as forming sub-networks critical to the topic area. To do this, the authors formulate a loss function whose optimization has four objectives, each corresponding to a term in the loss function:

 1. topic-specific knowledge erasure: increase the perplexity on knowledge-base triples for the target topic area
 2. preserve knowledge about non-target topics: perplexity on knowledge-base triples from non-target topics should be maintained at baseline (pre-intervention) levels
 3. preserve general language fluency: the perplexity of non-target topic text should be maintained at baseline (pre-intervention) levels
 4. sparsity: the learned parameter mask should mask out few parameters of the original LLM -- i.e., it should be sparse

Experiments performed on triples from two different knowledge bases (WordNet and ConceptNet) show that the knowledge erasure procedure given does in fact increase perplexity on target-topic triples but not on triples from other topics. And the experiments show that basic linguistic fluency is maintained such that language perplexity does not increase for text outside of the target topic area.

The authors also perform experiments to examine whether knowledge erasure causes the effected LLMs to perform worse on downstream Q&A tasks for questions related the target topic. And indeed they do.

Finally, ablation studies are performed to determine the importance of the first three component terms of loss function; additional experiments are performed to determine whether the detected knowledge-relevant subnetwork masks are robust such that expanding or shrinking their area does not drastically alter the level of knowledge erasured; and a slightly different objective function based on "knowledge expression" is tried but abandoned for the objective above.

### Strengths
The question of how topic-specific knowledge and expertise is stored in LLMs is important and fascinating since very little is currently well understood; and it is practically useful for purposes like correcting factual errors and censoring bigotry learned by a language model. So I view this area of research as one that will be active for the years to come.

And the approach of finding topic relevant parameter networks by learning to erase subject-specific knowledge while preserving other knowledge appears rather novel and clever.

Last, the experimental results demonstrate that the objectives optimized in the loss are achieved.

### Weaknesses
While an interesting start, I feel as though the paper falls short of its promise. The big piece that feels missing from this paper is an analysis of the detected subnetworks. The experiments showed that the subnetworks typically consisted of between 1% and 2% of the network parameters. But which groups of parameters were they? And at which network layers? How distributed throughout the network were they? Did they consist of adjacent/localized blocks of parameters, or were they isolated and distributed? Was there any other sort of topological structure associated with these subnetworks?  And how might the masked regions be working to zero-out knowledge? These questions are not explored. (Moreover, in the appendix, the authors show that rerunning the knowledge erasure procedure from different random seeds finds alternative subnetworks that erase the same set of facts but that have with fairly little overlap with each other. This shows that the found critical subnetworks are not unique, so there is perhaps a bigger story to be told.)

Another question I felt wasn't sufficiently explored relates to the permanence of the knowledge erasure process. In particular, could a motivated individual recover the erased knowledge by using clever prompting or a fine-tuning process? That is to say, is the erased knowledge still in the network somewhere?

Last, I found section 6.3's use of the term "overfitting" to be a bit confusing, since overfitting means that the loss on the training set is significantly less on the test set. But that's not what's being examined here. Instead, it seems like section 6.3 is devoted to sensitivity analysis, to see how robust the perplexity differences are to changes in the mask. But I found the region growing and shrinking approach used here to be unwarranted since, as mentioned above, no analysis is performed to determine whether the masks even have regional (contiguous) structure.

### Questions
My main question is whether there is some analysis performed which reveals the nature of the found masks. Are they contiguous / network-like structures, or something else?
