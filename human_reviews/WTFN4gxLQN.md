# Mask and Restore: Blind Backdoor Defense at Test Time with Masked Autoencoder

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an adversary maliciously manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a few validation data and model parameters, which are impractical in many real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service. In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test time, in particular for black-box models. The true label of every test image needs to be recovered on the fly from a suspicious model regardless of image benignity. We focus on test-time image purification methods that incapacitate possible triggers while keeping semantic contents intact. Due to diverse trigger patterns and sizes, the heuristic trigger search in image space can be unscalable. We circumvent such barrier by leveraging the strong reconstruction power of generative models, and propose a framework of Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). It detects possible triggers in the token space using image structural similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations. The detection results are then refined by considering trigger topology. Finally, we fuse MAE restorations adaptively into a purified image for making prediction. Our approach is blind to the model architectures, trigger patterns and image benignity. Extensive experiments under different backdoor settings validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

### Summary
This paper explores how to purify poisoned testing samples (with local triggers) based on a pre-trained masked auto-encoder (MAE) under the black-box setting where defenders can only query the deployed model and obtain its predictions. Specifically, the authors randomly generate MAE masks and calculate two trigger scores based on image structural similarity and label prediction consistency between test images and MAE restorations, respectively. The authors also exploit trigger topology to refine them further. After that, the authors will use their average to refine the poisoned testing sample. The authors evaluate their methods on CIFAR, VGGFace, and ImageNet dataset under 4 baseline defenses.

### Strengths
1. Black-box image purification is a practical setting for backdoor defenses. 
2. The proposed method is easy to follow.
3. The evaluation is extensive under their primary focus to a large extent.

### Weaknesses
1. One of my biggest concerns is its setting. To the best of my knowledge, most of the existing advanced backdoor attacks (e.g., WaNet and ISSBA) are with full-image-size triggers instead of local ones. However, the proposed defense can only remove local triggers. As such, its application is limited. Of course, I note that the authors explicitly state this in their limitations chapter, which is to be encouraged.
2. For me, the technical contributions are minor to some extent. Given we only consider local triggers, the main pipeline (without topology refinement) is straightforward. This part didn't enlighten me in any new way.
3. As for the topology refinement (Section 4.3), the authors should explicitly mention that there are many existing backdoor defenses (e.g., [1-2]) having a similar idea. The authors should also state the similarities and differences between their method and existing ones in the appendix.
4. I think there are many hyper-parameters involved in this paper, although the authors did not explicitly mention it. For example, those values in first two paragraphs (page 6) and in the second paragraph (Section 4.4). The authors should also discuss their effects.
5. Please provide more justifications of the last paragraph in Section 4.2. 
6. Please provide more justifications of the last two sentences in Discussion and Limitation (page 9).
7. The ASR after defense is still high (e.g., >10%) in many cases.

### Summary
This paper proposes to leverage Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) to remove backdoor on samples at test time. For detecting the triggered patches, it proposes the image-based score and the label-based score to guide the masking.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes a test-time backdoor defense method. Test-time backdoor defense is an important and vital topic.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation is unclear. The introduction of MAE will cause the model to take much time during inference. There are lots of well-performed backdoor sample detection methods that can detect backdoor samples accurately. From my point of view, it is good enough to detect the poisoned samples. Why is it necessary to give the ground-truth label of the triggered samples? 
2. I wonder why DDPM-based method has only around 70% accuracy in Table 1. I think it is strange and can the authors provide a reason?
3. The number of model architectures and attack methods being tested is clearly below the ICLR acceptance threshold. All the experiments are conducted on ResNet against only 4 attacks.
4. Model repairing-based backdoor defense should be compared.  ACC and ASR in Table 3 after the backdoor defense BDMAE is not as good as the model repairing-based backdoor defense.

### Questions
Does MAE need to be finetuned when employed to CIFAR10 or CIFAR100?

### Summary
The author proposes to use masked auto encoders (MAEs) to locate possible trigger patterns, and apply removal and reconstruction with MAEs to mask and restore the image in order to remove triggers. Using the restored images to train models can defend them effectively against backdoors.

### Strengths
* The method is in general agnostic to the triggers and models, which makes it more applicable than other approaches.
* The results show that the use of MAEs to defend against backdoors is effective.

### Weaknesses
* The time complexity involved with using a MAE to cleanse data is not well explained. Is the additional compute worth the effort?
* Many attacks generate stealthy but non-localized triggers, for instance, WaNet [1], LIRA [2], Marksman attacks [3], Flareon [4], etc. It remains to be seen how the proposed defense can be effective against such attacks.
* This paper assumes the availability of an MAE for image restoration, such models may not exist for the training dataset. In addition, despite mentioning the use of out-of-distribution (OOD) data to cleanse backdoors, no results are presented for OOD scenarios.
