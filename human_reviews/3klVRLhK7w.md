- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Majority of online continual learning (CL) places restrictions on the size of replay memory and a single-epoch training to ensure a prompt update of the model. However, the single-epoch training may imply a different amount of computations per CL algorithm, and additional storage for storing logit or model in addition to replay memory is largely ignored as a storage budget. Here, we used floating point operations (FLOPs) and total memory size in Byte as a metric for computational and memory budgets, respectively, to compare CL algorithms with the same total budget. Interestingly, we found that the new and advanced algorithms often perform worse than simple baselines under the same budget, implying that their value is less beneficial in real-world deployment. To improve the accuracy of online continual learners in the same budget, we propose an adaptive layer freezing and frequency-based memory retrieval for episodic memory usage for a storage- and computationally-efficient online CL algorithm. The proposed adaptive layer freezing does not update the layers for less informative batches to reduce computational cost with a negligible loss of accuracy. The proposed memory retrieval balances the training usage count of samples in episodic memory with a negligible computational and memory cost. In extensive empirical validations using CIFAR-10/100, CLEAR-10, and ImageNet-1K datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in the same total budget.

### Summary
This work considers the online continual learning setting with computational restrictions. The authors propose an adaptive layer freezing approach based on the information gain per iteration measured by the Fisher information and other heuristic design. Additionally, to guarantee adequate information acquisition by the network, they suggest a frequency-based, similarity-aware retrieval schedule.

This work aims at improving the computational efficiency without an extensive focus on adapting specific neural architectures. Extensive experiments are provided to substantiate the proposed algorithmic approach.

### Strengths
The writing and presentation are clear, with detailed comparisons to prior research. This study benchmarks computational resources in terms of FLOPS, offering a relatable metric to appreciate its contributions. The paper carries out extensive experiments to support the results.

### Weaknesses
See the Questions.

### Questions
I haven't observed an "unfreezing" step within the proposed algorithm. Given that the focus is on online continual learning, how does the algorithm account for potential shifts in data distributions?

The constraints on computational resources could potentially lead to suboptimal performance. How are the hyperparameters adjusted to ensure a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy?

The application of these methods across diverse network architectures remains unclear to me. Would there be a requirement to rescale the information gain, especially considering that wider layers might inherently convey more information? Additionally, I remain uncertain about how this method can be applied to specialized structures like attention mechanisms. Could you provide some clarity on this?

### Summary
This work is an improvement of the method to solve the online continual learning problem with budgeted computational power. The proposed method, based on measuring the computational cost in FLOPs and storage cost in bytes, consists of two designs: adaptive layer freezing and frequency-based sampling. Adaptive layer freezing uses Fisher Information to determine the layers to skip updating for less informative batches. Frequency-based sampling estimates the similarity between categories and maintains a relatively constant use frequency across samples. This work compares the “last accuracy” (A[last]) and the “area-under-the-curve of accuracy” (A[AUC]) of both Gaussian task and disjoint task of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet under certain computational budget and claims an outperforming improvement against seven other existing algorithms.

### Strengths
+ This paper targets the emerging continual learning.
+ The proposed method is supported by strong statistics theories.
+ This work carries out extensive evaluation and comparison among different algorithms.

### Weaknesses
- It would be helpful to further improve the presentation of this paper.
- There are occasional grammatical, phrasing, and spelling issues.
- It would be helpful to further highlight the difference between this work and existing efforts.
- Some claims in this paper require more supporting evidence.

### Questions
1. Section 4.1: Regarding the claim “A[AUC] is a suitable metric …”, is there any evidence or findings to support this claim?
2. Figure 3: L-SAR chooses slightly lower GFLOPs per sample than other methods. It would be helpful to explain the reason leading to this decision.
3. Considering the contribution claim of measuring computational budget in FLOPs and storage budget in bytes, how does this work compare against prior work?
4. The term “logit” seems ambiguous and can mean multiple things. Does it refer to “the unnormalized output vector of a classification model before the softmax operator” (a definition specific to TensorFlow)?
5. With the claim in the abstract, “the new and advanced algorithms often perform worse than simple baselines under the same budget”, it would be better to explain the abnormality in detail. Are these algorithms running on a budget on par with what they are designed for? What are the situations in which those algorithms excel?

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper claims two contributions. First, it makes the case that in order to fairly compare different continual learning algorithms, we need to compare them under the same computational and total-memory constraints. Second, it proposes a novel approach, which combines adaptive layer freezing (to reduce computation) and targeted memory retrieval for more efficient learning.

### Strengths
The main strength of this paper is that it makes the case that we need to start taking into account the computational demands of continual learning algorithms. I fully agree with the authors here.

### Weaknesses
- In my opinion, Section 3 needs a lot of work before the paper is ready for publication, because it fails to adequately and clearly explain the two components of the proposed approach. I have personally read this section four times, inlcuding a lot of back-and-forth to the appendix, in order to fully understand the proposed approach. I also think that the pseudocode is too important, and has to be included in the main paper. The same holds for the information discussed in Sections A.2 and A.3. 
- I am not sure I agree with the way the authors measure computational cost. According to my understanding, neural network training can be split in three stages: i) the forward pass, during which we calculate layer activations; ii) the backward pass, during which we calculate layer gradients; iii) the update of the weights. I think that the paper might conflate the backward pass with the weight updates. The proposed approach computes all the layer gradients regardless of the adaptive layer freezing. Hence, the backward pass is always completed in full, and the computational savings might be much less than what they appear at first glance (please correct me if I'm wrong).
- I think you should include another section in the appendix, where you discuss in detail the memory sizes (number of instances) you use in all your experiments. I would also appreciate a more detailed description of the calculations behind the memory sizes (with examples). 
- I found the ablation to be incomplete, as it only includes the Gaussian setup (but not the disjoint), and it does not examine the Vanilla+Freezing approach (i.e., with random retrieval).
- The paper does not include any wall-clock time comparison to further reinforce their comparison with respect to FLOPs.
- There are multiple issues with the references (i.e., duplicates, references with incorrect publication status).

### Questions
- Could you specify exactly which computations are counted in the L-SAR computational budget?
- Could you explain exactly how you calculate $A_{\text{AUC}}$? In particular, are you using the entire test set at every evaluation point, and how often do you evaluate?
- I could not find any mention of the number of runs for each experiment. 
- Did you use a test to decide which results are a statistically significant improvement? In all tables, you always bold the highest mean accuracy of each column, but I think that you should only bold when the difference is statistically significant. 
- Do you train the model only with data sampled from memory or do you also use stream observations (e.g., like in ER or MIR)?
- Did you compare your freezing strategy with a naive freezing strategy (e.g., one where you determine the freezing cutoff layer at random)?
- Why do you use only the gradient of the last feature layer in Eqs. (4) and (6)?
- You write "We evaluate the methods in [...] a newly proposed Gaussian task setup for boundary-free continuous data stream (Wang et al., 2022d; Koh et al., 2022)." However, Wang et al. adopt the setting of [1], while Koh et al. propose a periodic setup that is different from [1]. Could you clarify which setup you are using?
- In Algorithm 1, line 22, there is an acronym "B-FIUC" which I did not encounter anywhere else in the paper. Could you explain what it is?
