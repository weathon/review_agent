## Abstract
A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.

### Summary
In this work, the authors use mirror descent principles to derive the distribution of final synaptic weights, under certain assumptions. Theoretical findings demonstrate that this distribution is determined by mirror descent potentials. Analyzing synaptic weight distributions before and after training is crucial for understanding brain mechanisms. The paper applies mirror descent theory to distinguish learning rules in the brain, modeling it under chosen synaptic geometry. Drawing from this theory, the paper shows that, under specific assumptions, weight changes in dual space follow a Gaussian distribution. This insight aids in inferring synaptic geometry from the weight distribution. The authors validate this approach through experiments on artificial neural networks and demonstrate its applicability to real neural data.

### Strengths
The application of concepts from mirror descent to underscore the significance of selecting the appropriate distance function is a commendable idea.

### Weaknesses
The main drawback is the multitude of assumptions made in the article, leading to a highly robust conclusion. I've outlined what I consider to be the most unreasonable five assumptions:

1. Our brain is a feedforward network with no feedback and lacks any dynamic processes.
2. During learning, only the neurons in the last layer of our brain update.
3. Our brain should exclusively perform a supervised learning task.
4. Our brain uses gradient descent algorithms.
5. The optimal values for our brain's neurons for a given problem are unique and deterministic.

Each of these five assumptions is overly restrictive, and some are evidently incorrect, conflicting with known experimental evidence. 

Moreover, the conclusion itself also appears highly unreasonable: the distribution of synaptic strength in our brain neurons, as well as the brain's structure and the environmental context (task execution), appear to be unrelated. The distribution of synaptic strength is solely related to geometry.

 And the conclusion itself lacks significance. What matters is, assuming the article's conclusion is correct, why we would choose this specific geometry, what advantages it offers, and how we arrive at such a choice.

### Summary
This paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding the geometry of synaptic changes based on the synaptic weight distribution. In particular, they show that the synaptic weight distribution in real brains are inconsistent with vanilla gradient descent, which assumes Euclidean distances in weight space. Based on the Mirror descent framework, they derive a theorem that shows that the distribution of weights after learning depends on the initial distribution plus a Gaussian in the dual space for large models and data. The authors then show that the theorem holds in a linear regression setting, and that hypothesizing the wrong potential yields non Gaussian weight distribution. Then, the authors show that their theorem holds well despite unsatisfied assumptions in the case of classic deep learning convnets fine-tuned on ImageNet data. Finally, they consider biological data and conclude that both the distribution before and after learning are needed to conclude about the geometry of synaptic changes, but that vanilla SGD can be ruled out.

### Strengths
The strengths of the paper are:

**Originality:** The approach is original and principled, and it can make verifiable predictions about the biology. It is nice that the theory is robust to changes in the potential.

**Quality:** The quality of the text and figures is high.

**Clarity:** The paper stays very clear despite the theorem being a tad math-heavy.

**Significance:** I think tackling the question of what geometry is followed by synapses in the brain is significant. It is true that most computational neuroscience work assume vanilla SGD so the question whether the resulting weight distributions are coherent with biological data is an important point.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is that even though the theory is agnostic to the loss function and dataset, it seems that it is not agnostic to the architecture given section 4.3. So it would maybe make sense to also try more plausible architectures than ANNs to test the theory like continuous Hopfield networks or Spiking networks trained with surrogate gradients for instance, or at least vanilla RNNs, since the brain is highly recurrent. This would provide a sense of how important is the architecture vs the learning rule.

### Questions
- Section 4.4: I find the choices of the initial $w_0$ surprising to demonstrate the fits, isn't $w_0$ supposed to be the distribution before learning? If yes then it is surprising that it needs to be a mix of two constants since it is likely not the case in brains. Could the authors elaborate on that?

- Can you elaborate on the link between geometry of plasticity and the locality of the learning rule? I would expect non Euclidean geometry to be non local since the metric tensor needs to be inverted, however Eq 7 does look local. 

- Isn't the use of optimizers such as Adam a way to have a different geometry of plasticity in ANNs?

### Summary
The paper uses the mirror descent framework to derive results for the distribution of weights in converged networks. The paper shows that under a linearity assumption (and an L2 loss), the final distribution of weights is Gaussian, and this result can be used to analyse weight updates in trained deep nets and also synaptic updates in brain regions.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1. The paper is, for the most part clearly written, and understandable. The mathematical sections in the main paper are also quite accessible and easy to follow.

2. The idea for using the mirror descent to analyse synaptic weight changes is an elegant one, and the simplifying the analysis using the linearity assumption indeed seems to make the problem more tractable for use on networks applied to data.

3. The experiments in section 4 are fairly thorough in validating the theory presented in section 3.

### Weaknesses
1. The distinction between "loss function" and "potential": The paper claims in section 2 that the mirror descent framework splits a synaptic weight update gradient into two terms: one dependent on "external errors" i.e. the loss function $l$, and one "intrinsic to the synapse" i.e. the potential $\phi$. However, I am skeptical that this is generally true: to the best of my understanding, we can say that gradients with respect to the potential $\phi$, $\Delta\phi$ are independent of gradients wrt the the loss $\Delta l$. However, given that both the loss function and potential are functions of the synaptic weights, and that the loss function is either chosen by the practioner or unknown (in the case of the brain), unless we _explicitly_ choose $l$ to represent _only_ errors extrinsic to the synapse, it is not clear to me how we can guarantee the above statement. Relatedly, it is also not clear to me whether we can always pick a loss function that only captures non-synapse-related changes in weights, and if we can guarantee that we have managed this in every use case.

2. Finally, the paper claims in section 1 to "make experimental predictions" and provide "new theoretical insights...about learning algorithms in the brain". In section 4.4, while it is clear from the results and the analysis that a non-Gaussian distribution of weights under the linearity assumption might indicate a non-Euclidean synaptic geometry, it is not clear how we can interpret this for insights about how learning happens in the brain, and for potential plasticity mechanisms. It is also not clear how extensible the analogy is from deep recurrent networks is to the brain -- synaptic weight changes may not be analogous to network weight updates via gradient descent, and therefore any theoretical results based on gradient descent may not port easily to neuroscientific insights.

The weaknesses taken together seem to make the paper fall short of the claims in the introduction. Without the interpretability, and further experimentation with neuroscience data, it is not clear to me what the framework adds in terms of neuroscientific insight. While it might be useful for analysing deep net behaviour, again, it is not clear how this can be used to improve deep net training either.

Minor point:
Terminology -- the terms "loss function", "distance" and "geometry" are used interchangeably without clarification, throughout the paper, and particularly in sections 1-2.1. It is not until section 2.1 that the distinction between the three terms and what they indicate becomes somewhat clear. This hinders readability and generally makes it very hard to grasp the premise of the paper or its implications without these terms being clearly explained.

### Questions
1. How can we guarantee that the loss function / potential function separation truly represents a separation between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the weight changes?

2. How to evaluate whether the linearity / Gaussian assumption has been violated, in cases where the loss and potential function are unknown?

3. How to make the "geometry of synaptic weight changes" more interpretable for neuroscientific insight?

### Summary
This paper develops a theory, based on mirror descent, of the distribution of synaptic weights changes. In particular, this distribution depends on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. They test theory predictions which are largely verified.

### Strengths
I’m a big fan of the ambition in this paper. It’s original, the results are good, and this line of work could have big implications. That being said, I found the paper really lacking in clarity (see below).

### Weaknesses
The big assumption that the brain is doing gradient descent…

“Notably, even if the brain does not estimate gradients directly, as long as synaptic weight updates are relatively small, then the brain’s learning algorithm must be non-orthogonal to some gradient in expectation” What’s the actual citation for this?? (i.e. not a review)

I found the paper pretty dense, and not easy to follow what was going on where, and I always had to keep lots of things in mind at any moment. I’m not sure exactly what to suggest, but considerable rewriting / putting things in appendices / focussing on intuition would be a good idea.

Couldn’t parse Fig 3. Needed more help in the caption / annotation..

“Nevertheless, with this data we can rule out a Euclidean synaptic geometry, and if we do have access to w0, then our results show that it is indeed possible to experimentally estimate the potential function.” Where do you show this? It’s not in Fig 5.

I didn’t follow the explanation before eqn 14. Could do with some clarifying.
