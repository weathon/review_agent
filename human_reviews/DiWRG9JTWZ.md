# MetaCoCo: A New Few-Shot Classification Benchmark with Spurious Correlation

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
Out-of-distribution (OOD) problems in few-shot classification (FSC) occur when novel classes sampled from testing distributions differ from base classes drawn from training distributions, which considerably degrades the performance of deep learning models deployed in real-world applications. Recent studies suggest that the OOD problems in FSC mainly including: (a) cross-domain few-shot classification (CD-FSC) and (b) spurious-correlation few-shot classification (SC-FSC). Specifically, CD-FSC occurs when a classifier learns transferring knowledge from base classes drawn from \underline{seen} training distributions but recognizes novel classes sampled from unseen testing distributions. In contrast, SC-FSC arises when a classifier relies on non-causal features (or contexts) that happen to be correlated with the labels (or concepts) in base classes but such relationships no longer hold during the model deployment. Despite CD-FSC has been extensively studied, SC-FSC remains understudied due to lack of the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. To this end, we present Meta Concept Context (MetaCoCo), a benchmark with spurious-correlation shifts collected from real-world scenarios. Moreover, to quantify the extent of spurious-correlation shifts of the presented MetaCoCo, we further propose a metric by using CLIP as a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in FSC, cross-domain shifts, and self-supervised learning. The experimental results show that the performance of the existing methods degrades significantly in the presence of spurious-correlation shifts. We open-source all codes of our benchmark and hope that the proposed MetaCoCo can facilitate future research on spurious-correlation shifts problems in FSC.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors present a large-scale, diverse, and realistic environment benchmark for spurious-correlation few-shot classification. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in FSC, cross-domain shifts, and self-supervised learning. The experimental results show that the performance of the existing methods degrades significantly in the presence of spurious correlation shifts.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and neatly presented. 
2. Exploring the spurious-correlation few-shot classification is a very interesting task.
3. Sufficient experimental results show that spurious correlation shifts damage the model performance.

### Weaknesses
1. Contributions are not clearly and accurately stated.
2. The explanation for the spurious-correlation few-shot classification is not easy to understand.

### Questions
1. In the experiment, why not use the most recent methods for comparison? I have only listed some references for 2021-2022, and the authors can use other recent methods rather than the enumerated ones.  I'm just curious about how recent methods perform on the MetaCoCo dataset.
2. How to understand the conceptual and contextual information mentioned in the manuscript?
3. The network structure of ResNet-50 is not explained in EXPERIMENTAL SETUP, it is suggested that the author explain it in backbone architectures.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel dataset, called METACoCo. The dataset targets at one research void that existing public datasets cannot evaluate – the spurious-correlation problem in few-shot classification. One metric is proposed to evaluate the spurious-correlation shifts. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of existing few-shot classification models etc. The results shows that the evaluated models degrade significantly in the presence of spurious-correlation shifts.

### Strengths
The main contribution of this paper is the created dataset. The dataset enables researchers to study spurious-correlation problem in few shot learning. The conducted experimental analysis is persuasive.

### Weaknesses
One of my concerns is the technical contribution of this work. Although this paper points out spurious-correlation that have not been well addressed by existing methods and a dataset is proposed, the technical contribution of this work would be more significant if a model can be provided to address the problem.

### Questions
What is the difference between spurious-correlation studied in this paper and overfitting in few shot learning? Can we view spurious-correlation as one type of model overfitting? If this is true, it would be interesting to have a comprehensive study of overfitting problem in few-shot learning, in addition to the spurious correlation studied in this paper.

### Summary
Out-of-distribution problems in few-shot classification are important and challenging, which considerably degrades the performance of deep learning models deployed in real-world applications. However, although cross-domain shifts and spurious-correlation shifts are two important real-world distributions, the lack of spurious dataset has left a gap in this important research area. In this paper, the authors present a new benchmark to accelerate the development of the spurious-correlation few-shot classification problem. Overall, I think it is important to study the spurious-correlation few-shot classification and the authors have done a great job to this area.

### Strengths
S1: The paper is well-motivated to propose a benchmark with spurious-correlation shifts collected from real-world scenarios. The presentation of this paper is fairly clear, and the details of the dataset construction are also explained thoroughly.

S2: The authors further proposed to use of a pre-training vision-language model CLIP for measuring the quantifying and comparing the extent of spurious correlations on MetaCoCo and other FSC benchmarks, which is quite impressive.

S3: Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the ability of current methods for addressing real-world spurious correlations, with the baselines including a wide range of existing representative approaches.

### Weaknesses
W1: Currently, many vision-language pre-training models, such as CLIP [1] and CoOp [2], evaluate the performance in few-shot setting. I hope to see the performance of pre-trained large models like CLIP on the MetaCoCo with spurious-correlation shifts.
