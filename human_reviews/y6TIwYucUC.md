# SPI-GAN: Denoising Diffusion GANs with Straight-Path Interpolations

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 8, 5

## Abstract
Score-based generative models (SGMs) show the state-of-the-art sampling quality and diversity. However, their training/sampling complexity is notoriously high due to the highly complicated forward/reverse processes, so learning a simpler process is gathering much attention currently. We present an enhanced GAN-based denoising method, called SPI-GAN, using our proposed straight-path interpolation definition. To this end, we propose a GAN architecture i) denoising through the straight-path and ii) characterized by a continuous mapping neural network for imitating the denoising path. This approach drastically reduces the sampling time while achieving as high sampling quality and diversity as SGMs. As a result, SPI-GAN is one of the best-balanced models among the sampling quality, diversity, and time for CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ-256, and LSUN-Church-256.

### Summary
The paper proposes SPI-GAN, a GAN-based denoising diffusion model that provides the best balance among the sampling quality, diversity, and time. The key idea is to predict the straight-path interpolated image i(u) of the target time-step u. SPI-GAN includes a mapping module, a generator, and a discriminator. The mapping module consists of an initial embedding network o to encode the random noise input (i(0)) and a NODEs-based mapping network h that converts that initial embedding to the denoised embedding at the target time-step u. The generator inputs that denoised embedding and predicts the straight-path interpolated image, while the discriminator differentiates between real and predicted i(u). SPI-GAN employs many components of StyleGAN2, including the generator and ADA augmentation. SPI-GAN can perform 1-step diffusion to achieve real-time speed while outperforming other GAN+Diffusion approaches in most evaluation scores.

### Strengths
- SPI-GAN can perform 1-step diffusion to achieve real-time speed, which is almost similar to StyleGAN2.
- Even with 1-step diffusion, SPI-GAN can achieve quite good performance. On CIFAR-10, it obtains the best Recall and outperforms other GAN+Diffusion approaches in FID. On CelebA-HQ-256, SPI-GAN acquires a reasonable FID score, which outperforms other GAN+Diffusion methods and some score-based model representatives. On LSUNChurch-256, it obtains a high coverage, outperforming CIPS and the GAN+Diffusion counterparts.
- The writing is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- SPI-GAN is highly grounded by StyleGAN2 (generator's backbone, ADA training), and I am not sure if the score-based components are important.
From Fig.6, by replacing the NODEs-based mapping network with StyleGAN2's mapping network, the model's performance is almost unchanged. That new network is pretty much StyleGAN2-Ada, but instead of modeling the clean image only, the model learns to generate the linear-interpolated version between the clean image (i(1)) and its full-noise version (i(0)), conditioning on an interpolation factor u. The NODEs-based mapping network, while being sophisticated, may not be necessary and can be replaced by a simple MLP-based solution. It makes SPI-GAN look like a pure GAN model, disguising itself as a diffusion model. It does not devalue the paper but changes its narrative.

- In Fig.8-Left, given the same initial embedding, latent vectors h(u) at different time-step u produce completely different output images. It does not match the expected behavior of diffusion models.

- Can SPI-GAN perform multi-step (NFE > 1), and if so, does the performance improve?

- The authors should ablate the model performance when adding the time-step (u) input to the generator. Ablation studies on the role of s are also recommended.

- SPI-GAN has a worse FID score compared with other Diffusion+GAN counterparts on LSUN-Church.

- Fig 7: The x ticker labels are too close to each other. The caption should be improved, e.g., "stochastic" -> "stochasticity".

### Questions
- Can you replace the NODEs-based mapping network with StyleGAN2's mapping network, and report the performance of that model in Table 1-3? Does SPI-GAN have noticable better performance compared with that pure GAN method?
- In Fig.8-Left, given the same initial embedding, latent vectors h(u) at different time-step u produce completely different output image. It does not match the expected behavior of diffusion models. Can you explain why?
- Can SPI-GAN perform multi-step (NFE > 1), and if so, does the performance improve?
- The authors should ablate the model performance when adding the time-step (u) input to the generator. Ablation studies on the role of s is also recommended.

### Summary
This paper proposes solving the generative trilemma by using a GAN approach that imitates the denoising process of a score-based diffusion model. The method uses a time-conditioned generator (implicitly by the latent) and discriminator. The denoising process is linear, unlike SDE-based diffusion, and the latent is computed by a neural ODE.

### Strengths
- The authors have succeeded in presenting their research in a clear way, and the background work is relevant.
- The integration of optimal transport ideas into the context of diffusion is a novel and intriguing concept. This innovative approach not only contributes to the paper's originality but also has the potential to inspire further research in this promising direction.
- The paper's method seems to achieve a shorter interpolation path between images and noise. This outcome opens up new opportunities for further study of improved noise schedulers in diffusion model theory.
- The introduction of the general idea of straight-path interpolation deviates from traditional diffusion trajectories and introduces a new perspective on how denoising can be easily handled. This again could lead to further research.

### Weaknesses
- The NODE map, as evidenced in Figure 6, appears to offer marginal improvements over the vanilla mapping network from StyleGAN2. Consequently, the novelty of the method diminishes, as it seems to reduce to an image and time-conditioned StyleGAN. The authors should address how the method distinguishes itself more significantly from existing approaches.
- In a quantitative image quality comparison, the proposed method does not appear to clearly outperform vanilla StyleGAN2 in Tables 1-3. For instance, StyleGAN2 trained with ADA (same as SPI-GAN as shown in Sup. Mat. Table 8) exhibits superior performance in Table 1. Additionally, in Table 2, a StyleGAN2 comparison is missing, but running the official StyleGAN2 implementation on CelebA-HQ-256 with default settings (gamma=1, noaug) yields an FID score of 5, lower than the proposed method. A comprehensive quantitative analysis is required to establish the method's advantage.
- The claim of achieving diversity as good as score-based models is made based on datasets that are, in some cases, insufficient for assessing diversity. The resolution of the datasets is often low, and they are primarily single-domain (faces and churches). To validate the diversity claim, it is essential to perform experiments on more extensive, real-world datasets, such as ImageNet, which encompasses a broader range of categories and challenges.
- While diversity is addressed in Table 4, there is a noticeable absence of baseline comparisons with vanilla StyleGAN2 or other diffusion models. Such comparisons would help in understanding whether the method genuinely offers improvements in terms of diversity, or if it simply matches existing capabilities.
- The authors assert that their method solves mode collapse, citing DD-GAN and Diffusion-GAN works. However, these references appear to provide limited empirical evidence, with only DD-GAN offering a toy experiment on the 25-Gaussians dataset. A more comprehensive and substantiated analysis, ideally on a more complex dataset, would bolster the method's credibility in addressing mode collapse.

### Questions
- Have the authors considered the potential applicability of the implicit noise schedule produced by their method to other diffusion models? An exploratory comparison with commonly used schedulers in the field could provide valuable insights.
- Is there a discernible difference between implicitly including the noise level in the latent space, as done in the paper, and explicitly passing it like the discriminator?
- Given the application of optimal transport in the paper, do you believe this approach could be extended to regular diffusion models similarly? It could be interesting to explore the generalizability of this idea.

### Summary
SPI-GAN is a denoising diffusion GAN that is a hybrid generative model that is based on GAN with a generator and discriminator and it is trained to denoise the corrupted image. The generator is trained to denoise corrupted images by following a straight path that is the shortest path with minimum Wasserstein distance. And discriminator is a time-dependent discriminator and learns to discriminate images on various interpolation points.

### Strengths
The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow.

It explains the gap (trilemma) and addresses the gap with a novel solution. The explanation is supported by formulation and figures.

The evaluations are well-performed and convincing.

They share their code and the trained networks for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
The discussion of the limitations is short, so it can be elaborated.

Although SPI-GAN remodels the task in a simpler way and is easier to learn, its training time is longer.

### Questions
Similar to Table 5, can you provide the comparison table for training time? Actually, in the time analyses section, it is said that 'our method only affects the training time' and it is understandable but seeing the difference/effect can be good.

### Summary
This paper integrates the diffusion process into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) training, striving to achieve the fast image generation capabilities of GANs with the enhanced generation diversity proffered by diffusion models. The authors introduce the diffusion forward process into both the real images and the latent code of the generator, subsequently employing a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to facilitate the mapping from $h(0)$ to $h(u)$ for generator's input. With the diffused latent code, the generator is trained to produce images conditioned on time $u$, while the discriminator receives diffused real images. Empirical investigations conducted across three benchmark datasets—CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and LSUN-Church—underscore the approach’s efficacy, showcasing noticeable improvements. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the generator’s ability in generating images across varied $u$ values.

### Strengths
1. Combining diffusion models with GANs for enhanced diversity and a fast generation process presents an intriguing research topic.

2. Employing Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to map embeddings, while conditioning the latent code input to the generator  on time, is an interesting approach.

3. The experimental section demonstrates performance improvements over the baselines.

4. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The rationale behind integrating the diffusion process into the generator, particularly in terms of applying it to the latent code input, remains unclear. This might be attributable to the discriminator being exposed to a variety of augmented images, potentially helping to avert overfitting. Meanwhile, the results in Table 3 depict a noticeably inferior performance of SPI-GAN in comparison to both Diffusion-GAN and StyleGANs, raising questions about the soundness of the approach of employing the diffusion process on the generator.

2. An ablation study could be beneficial, exploring alternatives to using the Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) on the latent code. Investigating the generator’s performance when directly conditioned on the diffused latent code $h(u)$—without the NODE—or simply conditioned on $u$, could provide valuable insights into the viability of such designs.

3. The observed performance gains over the baseline are relatively modest. Particularly in the case of LSUN-Church-256, the proposed method trails behind both Diffusion GANs and StyleGAN2. It's also inconvincing that the paper does not include a comparison of SPI-GAN with DiffusionGAN on CelebA-HQ-256, which could have provided a more comprehensive evaluation.

4. Including details on training time, particularly in comparison to DiffusionGAN, would enhance the paper’s completeness.

### Questions
1. Is $u$ applied directly to the image, or is it integrated into an intermediate layer within the discriminator’s architecture?

2. Given that $h(u)$ can be derived from $i(u)$ in the current design, I'm curious to know if the generator has the ability to create images that are very similar to the real images, $i(u)$.
