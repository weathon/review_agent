- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
With the continuous advancement of smart city construction, the availability of large-scale and semantically enriched datasets is essential for enhancing the machine’s ability to understand urban scene. When dealing with large-scale scene, mesh data has a distinct advantage over point cloud data, as it can provide inherent geometric topology information and consume low memory space. However, existing publicly available large-scale scene mesh datasets have limitations in scale and semantic richness, and cannot cover a wider range of urban semantic information. Moreover, the prevailing large-scale 3D datasets mainly consist of a single data type, which restricts the wide applicability of benchmark applications and hinders the further development of 3D semantic segmentation techniques in urban scene. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive urban-scale semantic segmentation benchmark dataset. This dataset provides finely annotated point cloud and mesh data types for 3D, as well as high-resolution original 2D images with detailed 2D semantic annotations. It is well suited for various research pursuits on semantic segmentation methodologies. The dataset covers a vast area of approximately 2.85 square kilometers, containing 10 semantic labels that span both urban and rural scenes. Each 3D point or triangular mesh in the dataset is meticulously labeled with one of ten semantic categories. We evaluate the performance of this novel benchmark dataset using 6 widely adopted deep learning baselines. The dataset will be publicly available upon the publish of the paper.

### Summary
This paper proposed CUS3D, which is a large-scale dataset for 3d semantic segmentation. It features various scenes and 2 data types, point clouds and mesh. 10 semantic categories are included in the dataet. 2d raw images are also annotated. 6 deep-learning based models are evaluated on the dataset to give baselines. Performance on models with or without RGB information as input is also evaluated.

### Strengths
The motivation of building a large dataset with diverse scenes and various data types is clearly stated.
The captured dataset is interesting, and implies a big collection effort. 
The release of dataset is a nice contribution to the community.
6 baseline models are evaluated on the proposed dataset and overfitting is discussed.

### Weaknesses
CONBRITUTION: Since there already are many 3d datasets for semantic segmentation, and many of they are of drone images. The authors may want to state the contribution of their contribution more clearly. What's the weakness of existing datasets? Can the proposed dataset inspire research on some unexplored problems? 

DATASET: The paper is overall sound and easy to follow, however, the authors may want to provide more detailed and clear descriptions for the proposed dataset.
1. Annotation accuracy: Is the dataset annotated by one annotator only? If not, please have everyone annotate some same areas and then measure the discrepancies between each person's annotations.
2. For drone images, scene depth is crucial. Please provide the drone’s flying height. Also, it would also be helpful if the author provide weather conditions while collecting the dataset, 3d reconstruction details(which algorithm or software is used? ). What's the resolution of CUS3d and existing datasets? A clear compare in table 1 may be more helpful.

EXPERIMENTS: The authors evaluate 6 baseline models on the dataset and discussed overfitting. From figure 6, I can see that the dataset is not evenly distributed on 10 categories. The authors may want to discuss influence of class imbalance on baseline models.

### Questions
1. The authors states that vast area and semantic richness as their main contribution. Does ‘semantic richness’ refer to variability in the content? 
2. Is the train/val/test split randomly？

### Summary
This paper present a new dataset for semantic segmentation of wide-area urban 3D models.  The 3D model for the dataset was collected by flying a UAV over a 2.85 square kilometer area, collecting high resolution imagery, and applying a structure-from-motion method to build a surface mesh, including color texture.  The 3D model is then annotated manually, applying one of ten labels to every point in the mesh.  Source images were also independently annotated with a different set of class labels using a semi-automated approach leveraging segment anything (SAM model) to suggest segmentation.  The 3D model is divided into 93 tiles, and the tiles are divided to training, validation, and testing groups.  Experiments compare a number of recent method for 3D segmentation on this dataset using standard segmentation metrics and comparing the impact of using geometry and color versus geometry alone.

The main contribution of this paper is the large segmented 3D model, which will be useful in benchmarking future 3D segmentation work.

### Strengths
The key strength of this paper is the dataset itself and the potential value of this data in supporting quantitative evaluation of 3D segmentation methods in future publications.  The size and resolution of this model is quite large.  Constructing and annotating every surface of the mesh manually is an enormous undertaking.  Large, labeled 3D datasets are lacking in the community, so this one could be quite valuable.  The experiments are also useful and set baselines for future experimentation on this dataset.  Overall, the clarity and organization of the paper is good, with some exceptions noted below.

### Weaknesses
The primary weaknesses of this paper are the choice and definitions of the ten classes, the disconnect and inconsistency between 2D and 3D annotations and classes. Other weaknesses include claims about prior datasets being in a single format, lack of some important details on how the dataset was created, and some formatting issues.

One of the biggest issues with this paper are the inconsistency of the ten chosen labels and the overlap in what those classes cover.  The chosen labels appear to be a mix of functional classes (like building and road) and landcover classes (like grass and high vegetation).  Some classes seem too specific, like "Lake", which probably should be called "Water" and include various water bodies.  Some classes seem too broad, like "Ground", which seems to be a catch-all for everything not in one of the other classes.  Furthermore "Ground" seems to overlap with other labels creating ambiguity.  For example, "Road" contains asphalt roads and parking lots, but "Ground" also contains asphalt surfaces.  So How do annotators know how to apply these labels in a consistent way?  Similarly, "Ground" contains bare soil surfaces which are likely also found in "Building sites".  There seems to be a lot of overlap between "Grass" and "Farmland" definitions as well.

It's also quite strange that Section 3.4 presents 2D image annotation of the source imagery as an entirely independent labeling task.  It even uses a different set of 18 labels.  As far as I can tell, the 2D annotations are not used later an in any of the experiments.  So why are they included?  It seems like a significant oversight to use different labels for the 3D and 2D annotations and to assign these labels by independent processes.  If the classes were the same it would have been easy to generate the 3D labels from the 2D labels, or vice versus.  It would be very valuable to have a dataset with both 3D segmentation labels and 2D labels that are geometrically consistent with each other.  That is, if you project the labels from the 3D model into the image they are consistent with the 2D labels except in the case of moving objects like pedestrians and driving vehicles.  If Section 3.4 is not consistent with or related to the 3D model segmentation and not used in any further experiments then it is not relevant to the paper and should be removed.

In the introduction, the second claim about limitations of existing datasets is that these datasets are in a single format (point cloud or mesh).  This is a somewhat weak argument because any dataset that is provided as a mesh can be converted to a point cloud by sampling points on the surface.  This is exactly what is done in this paper.  I suppose the advantage of releasing the data as both a point cloud and mesh is that there is an official version of both the point cloud and the mesh for researcher to use in experiments.  So there is still value in releasing multiple formats, but it's not a big limitation of past mesh models.

There is some confusion about the number of tiles.  The paper says there are 93 tiles, but 4 are blank and Figure 10 shows the distribution of blank tiles on the periphery of the scene.  It's not clear why there are blank tiles, why there are only 4, and why this is important enough to have a figure showing where they are.  The paper then mentions an 8:1:1 split of training, testing, and validation.  However, it says there are 66 training, 8 test, and 8 validation blocks.  This is not exactly 8:1:1, which is fine, but it might be good to say "approximately 8:1:1".  More importantly, this only adds to 82, so what are the other 7 block use for?

At the bottom of page 8 it says "our dataset does not perform well on PointNet++ (Caesar et al. 2020)".  However, Table 2 shows that PointNet++ does perform well and SPGraph performs the worst.  Furthermore the citation of (Caesar et al. 2020) is not correct for neither PointNet++ nor SPGraph.

Other more minor issues are as follows:
- The paper mentions using SFM to construct the 3D model, but no detail are give about which SFM software/algorithm is used.
- Fonts in most figures and tables are too small
- It would be nice if the right of Figure 6 plotted train, test, and validation just like the left of the figure.
- Figure 7 has the wrong caption, a copy of the Figure 6.

### Questions
Please justify how the set of 10 ten class labels where selected and how you deal with ambiguities in the class definitions.  Why not reused the same classes used in prior work?

Please explain why there is a different set of classes for segmentation of the 2D images and why these are not consistent with the 3D segmentation classes.  Why is there also a different, independent process for annotating 2D images that doesn't seem to benefit the 3D annotations or vice versa?

What is the purpose of the blank tiles?  Why are they to begin with created?  Why are there only 4?  Why is their location important (Figure 10) if they are to be ignored?  What is the purpose of the extra 7 tiles that not blank but also not used in training, test, or validation?

### Summary
The paper presents CUS3D, an urban-scale semantic segmentation 3D benchmark dataset intended to boost machine understanding of urban scenarios. Covering roughly 2.85 square kilometers, the dataset offers three data types including point clouds, images, and meshes with semantic annotations (i.e., 10 categories) across urban and rural scenes. It has been thoroughly tested with six point cloud semantic segmentation baselines, confirming its reliability for research.

### Strengths
The principal contribution of this paper lies in the provision of a novel dataset and benchmarks to the relevant community. The salient feature of this dataset is its offering of multiple annotated data formats, along with a substantial size that covers an area of nearly 3 $km^2$. Additionally, this paper presents a comprehensive review of existing 3D urban benchmark datasets, which hold a certain significance.

### Weaknesses
The reviewer appreciates the substantial effort made by the author in collecting, collating, and annotating data, thus providing meaningful resources for the community. However, the reviewer believes that while this work might be sufficient for a workshop paper, it would require additional contributions in terms of novelty and completeness to qualify as an academic article.

- Innovation: 1. The advantages of this dataset, in terms of timeliness and scale, are not strong when compared to existing datasets such as the earlier Campus3D and large-scale SansetUrban. 2. The method of constructing a photogrammetry 3D dataset is relatively common and has been explained in detail in Campus3D and SUM. And there are seldom technical contributions based on this dataset.

- Completeness: 1. The annotation of 2D areal images in this dataset employs cutting-edge methods SAM. However, there is a lack of detailed verification (accuracy and robustness of annotation) and other settings. 2. The paper proposes three annotated data formats but only showcases the baseline method based on point clouds. Considering the differences between 2D images and 3D, the baseline based on areal images should also be considered. 3. More technical details should be included. Please refer to question.

### Questions
1. The authors claim that the dataset has richer semantics and covers the semantic information of almost all of the urban scenes. As far as the reviewer knows, Campus3D and SensatUrban provide more categories than 10. 

2. The reviewer indicates that the methods for baseline establishment should be updated including more SOTA methods like point cloud transformer (Lai, Xin, et al. "Stratified transformer for 3d point cloud segmentation." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.)

3. As an important methodology, the SAM method for 2D annotation is not well-described, the author may clarify the parameters and settings. 

4. The details for the point cloud segmentation baseline are not provided, including epoch, batch size, and other essential parameters. It is also important to specify how to do data preparation (e.g. sampling) for large-scale point clouds.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new urban-scale 3D dataset. The dataset consists of both large-scale point clouds, meshes, and 2D images. A number of baseline methods have been evaluated on the dataset, and it shows that such a new dataset is still challenging for existing methods to learn 3D semantics.

### Strengths
1. Unlike most of existing datasets which only provide 3D point clouds, the introduced new dataset also provides 3D meshes for the community. In addition, it also has 2D images together with 2D annotations provided, which would be very useful for potential multimodal learning tasks.

2. The paper sets up the benchmark by evaluating 6 representative methods for 3D semantic learning, which looks great for future researchers.

### Weaknesses
The new urban-scale dataset looks great and would be beneficial for the community. Nevertheless, there are a number of minor questions:

1. There is a lack of details about the 2D images. For example, does every image has poses annotated? what is the image resolution and sampling density over the 3D arial space? How many 2D images in total? Does the dataset provide the exact correspondences between 2D pixels and 3D points/meshes?  I believe these would be critical if future uses want to fuse both RGB and 3D data for better semantic learning, or even 3D urban-scale novel view rendering.

2. There is a lack of details about the 3D reconstruction techniques. For example, how to find the pixel correspondences before triangulation? How to identify the outliers during 3D reconstruction? How to convert the 3D points to meshes? How about the quality of connected triangle meshes? 

3. For 3D semantic annotation, the paper states that "according to the standard definition of semantic categories". What is the standard? In fact, it seems the categories "Road" and "Ground" are quite similar. Therefore, more specifications need to be added to justify your definition of classes. In addition, the paper states that "assign labels using annotation tools". What are the tools? and what are the annotation strategies? 

4. For 2D semantic annotation, why are only 4336 images annotated? Is it a very small subset of the entire 2D image sequences? Besides, why are there 18 semantic classes on images, but 10 classes on 3D data? Are the 2D annotations aligned with 3D annotations? How about the quality of 2D semantic labels? 

5. Figure 2 is a bit blurring. 

6. Do the authors get all permissions to release the collected dataset including all 2D/3D data and annotations?
