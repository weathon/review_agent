# Orthogonal Function Representations for Continuous Armed Bandits

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
This paper addresses the continuous-armed bandit problem, which is a generalization of the standard bandit problem where the action space is a d−dimensional
hypercube $X = [−1, 1]^d$ and the reward is an s−times differentiable function
$f : \mathcal X → \mathbb R$. Traditionally, this problem is solved by assuming an implicit feature
representation in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where the objective
function is linear in this transformation of $\mathcal X$ . In addition to this additional intake,
this comes at the cost of overwhelming computational complexity. In contrast, we
propose an explicit representation using an orthogonal feature map (Fourier, Legendre) to reduce the problem to a linear bandit with misspecification. As a result,
we develop two algorithms _OB-LinUCB_ and _OB-PE_, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in terms of regret and computational complexity.

### Summary
This paper studies the continuum-armed bandit problem, which is an extension of the traditional multi-armed bandit. Specifically, the authors propose an explicit representation using an orthogonal feature map (e.g. based on Fourier, Legendre functions) to transform the original problem into a linear bandit with misspecification. And the authors develop two algorithms named OB-LinUCB and OB-PE and use a suite of simulations to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
Most parts of the paper are quite clear and easy to follow. 

Based on my knowledge it is new to use orthogonal function bases to transform the continuum-armed bandit into misspecifed linear bandits. The simulations also showcase the high efficiency of proposed algorithms.

I haven't checked all details of the proof in the Appendix, but I feel they should be correct. I will refer to other reviewers' opinions as well.

### Weaknesses
1. Nowadays, the study on continuum-armed bandit also focuses on the general metric space. (e.g. Zooming algorithm mentioned in your work studies arbitrary space with any distance). Could you extend your algorithm to general metric space? I feel it should be possible if we can construct a decent orthogonal basis on any metric space, is that true? But how to construct the function base is required but unknown.

2. I agree it is relatively hard to explore multidimensional space $[0,1]^d$, but I feel the current results in this work on multidimensional space are still weak. From Table 1 the proposed OB-PE can achieve non-optimal regret bound under the condition $d < 2s$, which is not up to the state-of-the-art literature in this area. For implementation, both the number of arms and the dimension of arms would increase exponentially, and hence I am not sure whether it can still perform well in multidimensional space.

3. Without knowing the value of $T$, I am not sure if the proposed algorithm still works since some settings (e.g. $N$) rely on the value of $T$.

4. For the presentation of Algorithm 1, why don't the authors specify how to discretize the arm space directly there? It seems that discretization is unavoidable for OB-LinUCB and OB-PE.

### Questions
Besides my concerns in the above Weaknesses section, could you also answer my question about your experiment as follows:

1. It seems that you only use OB-LinUCB which is lack of strong theoretical support in your experiment. Why don't you use OB-PE as well since it has some good theoretical property instead? It seems there is some inconsistency between theory and experiments.

2. I may overlook, but how many arms do you choose in experiments for OB-LinUCB? I think you discretize the interval [0,1] evenly (maybe with $\sqrt{T}$ arms). Do you have any theoretical support for OB-LinUCB when discretizing the arm set? I think this is very important and should be illustrated in your main paper clearly.

3. Some experiments one high-dim space (e.g. [0,1]^2) will make your experiments more reliable. I am concerned on the computational issue of the algorithm since the number of arms and dimension may explode exponentially.

### Summary
The paper resolves the continuous arm bandits where the reward function is smooth. By introducing orthogonal Fourier and Legendre feature maps, the paper shows that an approximation of the smooth function is possible even when the feature map is not available to the learner. The proposed algorithm achieves the nearly optimal regret bound in $d=1$ dimensional cases and in $d>1$ dimensional cases where the reward function is analytic. Empirical results show fair performance of the algorithm with computational efficiency.

### Strengths
The paper eliminates the assumptions on the reward functions in bandit problems with continuous arms and without Gaussianity, by constructing an orthogonal feature map. The proposed algorithm is principled and computationally efficient for estimating general reward functions. Helpful discussion on the hardness of deriving optimal regret bound on multidimensional arms navigates the future work direction.

### Weaknesses
(a) In Theorems 3-5, the choice of $N$ requires the knowledge of $T$.
(b) There is a large gap between the choice of $N$ in theoretical results and empirical results. The performance and the computational time of the proposed algorithms seem to be heavily affected by the choice of $N$. Numerical results and discussions on different choices of $N$ seem missing.

### Questions
Q. Could the algorithm be modified to execute without knowing $T$ a priori?
Q. How could we choose $N$ when we do not know the true reward function? If we choose $N$ as in Theorems 3-5, would computation be heavy?
Q. How does the choice of $N$ affect the performance and computational time of Fourier UCB and Legendre UCB?
Q. In Figures 1 (b) and 2 (b), why do Fourier UCB and Legendre UCB perform worse when they use only even functions and the true reward function is even?

### Summary
This paper studies continuum arm bandits with a generic smoothness assumption on the reward being $s$ times continuously differentiable. The main new idea of the paper is that by using a finite representation of the reward function in terms of a known orthogonal basis for the function class, one can reduce the problem to misspecified linear bandits. This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret in some regimes and better computation time than prior algorithms in the literature.

While I think the idea of this paper is novel, the theoretical regret bounds are only optimal in some regimes and the overall benefit especially over the cited algorithm UCB-Meta-algorithm is unclear.

### Strengths
* The paper is easy to read and well-written despite being quite math heavy, and I found the main algorithmic idea straightforward to follow.
* The thorough comparison with prior works in Section 5.3 was helpful for placing this result in context with the rest of the literature.

### Weaknesses
* It seems like the theoretical regret upper bounds require tuning $N$ with knowledge of the underlying reward function's smoothness $s$. This seems like an unrealistic assumption to me. Can the authors comment on misspecified $s$ or adapting to unknown $s$?
* In order to even use the orthogonal features (at least for dimension $d=1$), it seems like one also needs $(s+1)$-th derivative of $f$ to be square integrable. Is this a reasonable assumption to make for common reward functions in stochastic optimization? Some discussion on this would be nice.
* Looking at Table 1, it seems like the UCB-Meta-algorithm attains the optimal regret, while the main procedure of this paper OB-PE does not get optimal regret for $d>1$. The paper claims UCB-Meta-Algorithm has no regret guarantee for infinitely-differentiable rewards, but I don't see why I can't just run UCB-Meta-Algorithm with very large Holder exponent $s \gg d$ which should get a regret bound which is nearly $T^{1/2}$ acccording to bounds of Liu et al., 2021. Thus, the only real advantage of OB-PE seems to be in time complexity.
* There is a discrepancy between experiments and theory in the sense that the paper uses two different algorithms OB-PE vs OB-LinUCB for theoretical regret bounds vs experiments. It's not explained why OB-PE is not implemented or analyzed in experiments. Some explanation on this would be nice.

### Questions
# Questions
* See above in "Weaknesses".
* What is the dependence of the regret bounds of OB-PE on the Lipschitz constant $L$? In Lipschitz bandits literature, this is well known to be $L^{\frac{d}{d+2}}$, but it is not clear to me what dependence appears here.
* Theorem 4 for the $d>1$ dimensional regret upper bound does not seem to have any condition on the $(s+1)$-th partials of $f$, which seems wrong to me since Theorem 3 required it. Why is this?

# Writing Suggestions/Typos
* The regret formula in the first paragraph should have the terms reversed in the difference.
* In the fifth paragraph of page 1, the domain $[a,b]$ of $\phi$ should be $[a,b]^d$?
* I was confused why initially the reward function $f:\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ has unbounded scale, yet all the regret bounds seem to be scale-free. This is because the paper later on assumes $\|f\|_{\infty}=1$, i.e. assumes knowledge of the scale of $f$. It might be better to just define bounded reward $f:\mathcal{X}\to [0,1]$ from the outset to not mislead readers.
* Many environment references throughout the writing (e.g., algorithm 1, appendix 1, equation (1)) should have their names capitalized (e.g., Algorithm 1).
* In Section 4.2, the Lipschitz constant $L$ is used before it is defined.
* In the writing, "s+1-th derivative" would read better as "(s+1)-th derivative".

### Summary
Consider a continuous arm bandit problem where the action space is $[0,1]^d$. While Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) feature maps have been used previously, they present computational difficulties. The authors propose an approach that uses an orthogonal feature map to convert the problem into a linear bandit problem. This approach not only offers competitive regret guarantees compared to existing methods, but also reduces computational complexity.

### Strengths
An analysis of linear bandit algorithms under misspecification is utilized for continuous armed bandits, proposing an algorithm with a small computational complexity.

It demonstrates competitive performance numerically as well.

### Weaknesses
A significant portion of this paper seems to be dedicated to presenting classical results. While understanding the foundation is essential, I would encourage the authors to consider focusing more on their unique contributions to the field.

From my understanding, the proposed algorithm/analysis appears to present a solution for an efficient trade-off between misspecification (bias) and regret (variance) in the continuous arm bandit problem. However, the contribution seems to lie primarily in combining these elements, and I did not find the approach significantly novel. If there is technical novelty, it should be better presented and emphasized.
The paper does not clearly address the potential for the $d/s$ value to become significantly large (though not infinite). In such cases, the computational advantages of the proposed method compared to existing methods may not only be positive but could potentially be negative. This issue needs to be addressed.

The algorithm seems to require a substantial amount of inputs (values dependent on $T, N, s$, the choice of basis, etc.). How much does this limit its adaptability? Are there methods that are agnostic to $T$ or $s$? Or is this level of input requirement comparable to existing research? These questions are crucial when discussing the adaptability of the algorithm.

Considering the high standards of ICLR, it is unclear whether the contributions of this paper are significant enough to warrant acceptance. The authors might want to better highlight the novelty and impact of their work.

### Questions
As I also wrote in the previous section:

- What is the technical novelty of the proposed algorithm/analysis? How is it emphasized?
- Can you explain how the proposed method addresses the potential for the d/s value to become significantly large?
- To what extent does the substantial number of inputs required by the algorithm limit its adaptability?
- Are there methods that are agnostic to T or s?
- How does the level of input requirement in this paper compare to existing research?
