## Abstract
Designing a single model to address multiple tasks has been a long-standing objective in artificial intelligence. Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose **One for All (OFA)**, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.

### Summary
This paper proposes One-for-All (OFA), a framework for building and training a single graph model that can perform various graph-related tasks across different domains. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

### Strengths
1.	A unified graph model is designed for various tasks and different domains of graph data.

2.	The introduced model can encode features of different graphs into the same embedding space.

3.	Extensive experiments are conducted on various settings and datasets from different domains.

### Weaknesses
1.	The design of prompt nodes and utilizing NOI-subgraph to unify different tasks seem to be similar to several previous works. For example,  [1] introduced a learnable prompt vector to unify tasks, and [2-3] proposed to utilize super nodes to perform pooling readout. The proposed NOI prompt node appears to be a combination of these two lines of works. Could you include more in-depth discussions and comparisons with these related works.

2.	Comparison with methodologies that integrate LLMs and graph models, such as [4-7], is necessary. 

3.	The Few-shot and Zero-shot results, especially for TLP-SURGL and TLP-BGRL, do not outperform baseline models. Could you include further discussions and analysis of these underwhelming performance results? 

4. The ability of the LLMs to unify the feature space across datasets from diverse domains is very interesting. It would be insightful to see the unified feature representations of datasets within the same domain (e.g., two citation networks) and the datasets spanning different domains (e.g., a citation network and a molecular network). For example, some visual analysis will offer insights into the effectiveness of the LLM in harmonizing feature spaces across heterogeneous datasets.

5. Additional ablation studies can be conducted to see whether the constructed graph structure is helpful. For example, directly using the unified node features (produced by LLMs) as the input feature of some backbone GNN models like GIN, GCN, GAT.

6. The article introduces a method to employ LLMs to generate inputs for GNNs. Another line of works aims to utilize GNNs to generate inputs for LLMs, and it seems that this approach can better utilized LLMs' significant capabilities in addressing various problems on vast data. I'm curious about the difference between these two pipelines. Can you provide some explanations and compare the performance of these two pipelines.

### Summary
In the field of artificial intelligence, creating a single model to handle diverse tasks has been a longstanding goal. Large language models have excelled in language-related tasks, but applying this versatility to graph-based tasks is challenging. Graph data from different domains have unique attributes and distributions, making uniform representation difficult. Additionally, graph tasks encompass nodes, links, and graphs, necessitating distinct strategies. Furthermore, context-aware learning for graphs lacks a clear method.

To address these challenges, this paper introduced "One for All" (OFA), a framework that uses a single graph model to conquer these obstacles. OFA uses text-attributed graphs, unifying diverse graph data and standardizing task representation with "nodes-of-interest." It pioneers a novel graph prompting approach for versatile task handling without fine-tuning. They train OFA using data from various domains and evaluate its performance in diverse learning scenarios. The results establish OFA as the first general-purpose graph classification model, revolutionizing the field of graph-based artificial intelligence.

### Strengths
The motivation of this paper is well-delivered and interesting

The proposed method is novel and seems to be good according to their experimental report

### Weaknesses
W1. translating graph data with text feature sequences might lose some key information from graphs. 

W2. According to Figure 1, LLM enhances text for text-attributed graphs. it still needs a GNN as a predictor. (1) I wonder whether the GNN model is also pre-trained and frozen. and (2) what are the results compared with using LLM as a predictor instead of an enhancer?

W3. It is unclear how to use NOI prompt nodes and class nodes with GNN to predict the downstream tasks. according to Figure 2, can I say that the downstream tasks (node, edge, graph classifications) are treated as predicting links between NOI prompt and class nodes? It seems that NOI prompt nodes can be treated as a special case of the prompt graph mentioned in the paper "All in One" (Sun et al., 2023), what's the differences between them? and why the authors use only one NOI prompt node instead of multiple NOI prompt nodes.

W4. I wonder why the authors use sentence transformer instead of ChatGPT API, or LLAMA, etc since they claim that "any kind of LLM can be used as the encoder, and a stronger LLM potentially yields better overall performance." Is it possible that a very large language model contains too much unrelated knowledge/intelligence that may reduce task performance?

W5. I wonder what would happen if you Re-order the item in your prompt for ChatGPT.  It seems the reason why you use sentence transformer is that it is not sensitive to the order of your prompt? if you change to ChatGPT, different orders may generate entirely different sentences, making the downstream performance unpredictable

### Questions
see W1-4

I would like to see the rebuttal to the questions mentioned in the above section “Paper Weakness”. I’m afraid that I might have not sufficient time to see a very long rebuttal. A concise and clear one would be good.

The potential weakness won't prevent me from raising my final score. I just want to make clear whether my understanding is correct.

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified paradigm for learning different tasks over graphs and across different domains. Notably, the proposed algorithms achieve competitive performance in various tasks.

### Strengths
1. The framework proposed by the author is very interesting. The idea of prompted nodes naturally unifies the three major tasks in one simple but powerful problem formulation. 
2. The presentation of the result is clear with both quantitative and qualitative results.

### Weaknesses
1. The soundness of the experiments seems lacking. Based on my understanding, LLM is one if the key component to achieve cross-task and cross-domain generalization. However, the choice of LLM is rarely discussed. I didn't find detailed description of the LLM used in the main experiments. Neither a comparison between different LLMs is missing in main paper and appendix. 
2. The modeling of link-level task lack details. For example, do you have two or one class node?
