## Abstract
Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning. While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this work, we study the problem of learning a *data filtering network* (DFN) for this second step  of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on ImageNet can yield worse training sets than a model with low ImageNet accuracy that is trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset DFN-5B enables us to train state-of-the-art models for their compute budgets: among other improvements on a variety of tasks, a ViT-H trained on our dataset achieves 83.0% zero-shot transfer accuracy on ImageNet, out-performing larger models trained on other datasets such as LAION-2B, DataComp-1B, or OpenAI’s WIT. In order to facilitate further research in dataset design, we also release a new 2 billion example dataset DFN-2B and show that high performance data filtering networks can be trained from scratch using only publicly available data.

### Summary
This paper's focus is on dataset filtering for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP). The discussion on data-filtering networks (DFN) is motivated by the use of pretrained CLIP models (referred to as the DFN) to filter datasets by discarding image-caption pairs whose embeddings (as produced by the DFN) are not similar to each other. The paper's main observation is that accuracy of the DFN on a given task doesn't predict how good a subset it selects (even for that task). The paper then uses this to motivate the creation of new DFNs that are trained on high quality image-caption data and then fine-tuned on "important" datasets. The paper confirms the effectiveness of the approach by demonstrating competitive performance on ImageNet Zero-Shot, ImageNet Distribution Shift, VTAB, Retrieval etc when filtering DataComp's medium, large and xlarge data.

### Strengths
1. The problem of better understanding and improving DFNs is extremely interesting. 

2. The observation that a DFN with good accuracy on a given task doesn't necessarily induce a good dataset on that task is very interesting.

3. Several large-scale experiments are conducted to explore the effectiveness of the approach.

### Weaknesses
It seems like the improvement in performance over other DFNs is primary in ImageNet (and dist. shift) Zero-Shot as well as Retrieval. It seems like without "finetuning" on MS COCO training set, Flickr30k training set, and ImageNet 1K training set with ImageNet templates as captions, these performance improvements nearly disappear. While the main paper does ablate over fine-tuning, it doesn't highlight just how significant fine-tuning on these particular datasets is (primarily because these are the datasets we wish to evaluate on). 

Personally, I don't find the conclusion that training a DFN on high-quality image-caption datasets allows the induced subsets to be higher quality very surprising or interesting. I do think a fine-grained study into specific properties of the pretraining data (e.g. similarity with downstream tasks' data, diversity of data, data imbalance) can make this work interesting and help further our understanding of DFNs. In it's current form, apart from the observation on ImageNet accuracy of DFN and that of the model trained on the induced dataset, I don't see what the contribution of this work is towards understanding DFNs. 

While I recognize, the improvement in accuracy on ImageNet, Retrieval etc., the importance of fine-tuning the DFN on the evaluation datasets leads to me believe that this approach may not generalize to other downstream tasks (as evidenced by the < 1% improvement on VTAB).

### Questions
1) Is there any explanation for why a DFN with higher ImageNet accuracy is not always better at selecting data for ImageNet?

2) Could the authors go into greater depth about the impacts of fine-tuning i.e. is the key component of training a good DFN fine-tuning on the evaluation datasets. If so, how do the authors see these models as generalizing on unseen tasks? 

3) Is there a trade-off in accuracy on some datasets? For one of the models, could we see the per dataset accuracy for VTAB using different DFNs and see if there are trade-offs in which datasets improve and which don't?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of how to filter large-scale web-scrawled data into the training data for training CLIP models. The paper proposes a data filtering network (DFN) for this task. 
* Training DFN: DFN is a small CLIP model pretrained on a small but “high-quality” dataset based on the authors’ insight: (1) the performance of DFN itself is not correlated to the induced model trained on DFN’s filtered data (Figure 3) and (2) Induced model’s performance degrades as the quality of data drops (Figure 4).
* Using DFN for filtering (inference): DFN filters out image-text pairs whose cosine similarities are lower than a threshold (Section 2).

Based on the insight above, the paper curates the High-Quality Image-Text Pairs (HQITP-350M) dataset containing 357 million image-text samples with human-verified captions to train DFNs. In the experiments, the paper shows that CLIP models trained on DFN-induced datasets (1) achieve state-of-the-art performance, (2) improve model efficiency (i.e., training a smaller model that achieves similar performance with previous larger models), and (3) improve VQA performance. The paper will release the DFN-2B dataset filtered by DFN to facilitate future research.

### Strengths
1. The paper studies an important problem of filtering training data for CLIP.
2. The paper provides insight into the problem—high-quality pretraining data for DFN matters.
3. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with better model efficiency.
4. The paper will release the DFN-2B dataset, which is a good contribution to the research community.
5. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
### Major Concern

**[Details of Curating HQITP-350M]** The paper does not provide many details about how to create the high-quality HQITP-350M dataset for training DFNs. This is really important because it is the key for training a good DFN as the paper claims. For example, how does the human verification process work? For example, do human annotators make a binary decision of whether image and text are matched or give a score on the scale of 0 to 1? If it is the latter one, how to threshold the scores? How many annotators are requested? What is the source dataset for curating the HQITP-350M dataset? How many image-text pairs are filtered out by humans?

### Minor Concern

**[Definition of Dataset Quality]** The paper defines the “quality” of CLIP’s training data as the image-text similarity. I wonder if the authors consider other aspects to define the data quality, such as the quality of images and the quality of captions [1].

### Minor suggestions

For evaluating the robustness against distributional shifts, the paper can also discuss or include more evaluation on newer OOD ImageNet benchmarks: ImageNet-D, ImageNet-X, and ImageNet-W.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper compares the performance of (primarily) various configurations of CLIP models to filter image-text datasets for subsequently pretraining vision transformers. The authors make interesting empirical observations regarding the same, and are able to achieve an impressive accuracy vs. compute tradeoff on image-net using their best configuration of data filtering networks.

### Strengths
- SoTA compute vs. accuracy trade-off on image-net.
- Thorough & insightful analyses / recipes to understand the effect of different kinds of confounders while training data-filtering networks on downstream performance.
- Expected public release of the best-performing filtered datasets.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed approach is still a heuristic for filtering data, and is limited to pointwise filtering for the sake of parallelizability.
- The cost of filtering: (1) training the data filtering networks; and (2) linear inference over the entire dataset; might be too much to be amortized or ignored in the final compute vs. accuracy trade-off (more in questions).

### Questions
- Can you highlight the cost of filtering in e.g. Figure 1?
- (Not relevant to the final rating) What do you think about applying these data filtering networks to other domains, e.g., text, or speech, or music?
