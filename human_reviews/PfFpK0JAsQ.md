- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
In recent years, there has been extensive research into unsupervised feature selection methods based on self-representation.
However, there exists a major gap in the mathematical principles that underlie these approaches and their capacity to represent the feature space.
In this paper, a novel representation learning method, Graph Regularized Self-Representation and Sparse Subspace Learning (GRSSLFS), is proposed for the unsupervised feature selection.
Firstly, GRSSLFS expresses the self-representation problem based on the concept of ``a basis of feature space'' to represent the original feature space as a low-dimensional space made of linearly independent features. Furthermore, the manifold structure corresponding to the newly constructed subspace is learned in order to preserve the geometric structure of the feature vectors. Secondly, the objective function of GRSSLFS is developed based on a self-representation framework that combines subspace learning and matrix factorization of the basis matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of GRSSLFS is explored through experiments on widely-used datasets. Results show that GRSSLFS achieves a high level of performance in comparison with several classic and state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

### Summary
This paper introduce a novel unsupervised feature selection methods called GRSSLFS, which combine matrix factorization with self-representation subspace learning and apply graph regularization to preserve the geometric structure of the feature vectors. This method is proved to be effective in both theory and experiments.

### Strengths
In this paper, the author introduce the problem of the redundant data in traditional self-representation, and then apply matrix factorization self-representation problem to achieve the goal to reduce the dimension of basis matrix. Here are some strengths of this article:

1. This paper introduce a novel problem of redundant data in self-representation problems and then propose a method to solve this problem.

2. Plenty of theoretical proof are given in the paper and appendix, the convergence analysis indeed increase the persuasiveness of the article.

3. The proposed method was compared with a variety of comparison algorithms on multiple data sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
However, there are still some weaknesses in this paper.

1. In the end of Introduction section, the second and third contribution points is not sufficient, as these constraints of regularization are not proposed in this article. 

2. In the methodology section, some formula calculations are confusing and not very convincing. Such as the multiplication in formula (6) and the optimization target in the optimization goal (formula 7). These issues will be described in detail in subsequent questions 1 and 2.

3. In the methodology section, the description of the algorithm is not complete enough. The specific process of selecting features according to the matrix U in Algorithm 1 has not been described in detail.

### Questions
1. In the section of methodology, the equation (6) is confusing and not so clear. It seems impossible to subtract the matrix XUV of shape m*m from the matrix X with the shape m*n? 

2. As the feature matrix B is fixed by the VBE method proposed in section 3.3, it is unclear why the basis coefficient matrix G in equation (7) is a parameter to be optimized. Why the matrix G can not be determined by equation (4) directly and reduce the number of parameters.

3. In section 3.1, subspace learning that introduces graph regularization seems to be existing methods. Should this part of the content be moved to related work?

### Summary
Authors of this paper propose graph regularized self-representation and sparse subspace learning (GRSSLFS) for unsupervised feature selection. The basis extension method is modified to select bases with highest variance score. These bases are used to build graph regularized self-representation learning and subspace learning.

### Strengths
The graph regularized self-presentation learning and subspace learning are combined in terms of a set of selected bases from input space with the highest variance score. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method comparing with baselines. The ablation study also shows the necessity of each component.

### Weaknesses
The subspace learning module is the key component, but its derivation from selected bases highly relies on the assumption that XU=B. This might not be hold if B is selected according to the proposed variance basis extension method. Moreover, the selection based on subspace learning module lacks of convincing explanation since G does not exactly represent X based on B as a fixed set of feature vectors.

### Questions
It is confusing to explain (4) as the self-representation problem if B is arbitrary basis matrix since they may not come from the input data matrix X.  Taking PCA for example, the columns of B are orthogonal, but they are not from the input feature space. Moreover, B defined as a square matrix of size m is inconsistent with the sleeted r bases in section 3.3.

In section 3.1, authors mentioned that two features have a similar structure in the feature space, and it is expected Bg_l and Bg_r have similar structure. What does the similar structure mean? How is the similarity measured? In other words, it is unclear how the matrix A is constructed. 

The derivation in section 3.2 depends on the assumption that XU=B. As B is a set of feature vectors selected from input data, it is unclear whether the assumption still holds or not. Similarly for Theorem 3.1, it is trivial to have if the assumption holds. 

The variance basis extension is to simply change the selection order of feature vectors in terms of variance score of feature vectors. It is possible that for each individual feature, the variance is high, but is it similar to say the largest amount of data dispersion? 

For completeness, authors should describe the derivation process on how equations (9)-(11) are obtained. Since all three equations are fractional, is it possible that any of the denominators can be zero? How is it handled?

In Algorithm 1, the selected features are derived from U. However, U is not directly related to the input X instead to B and G, unless BG=X. However, B is selected feature vectors from input space. It is unclear why the assumption can hold. So why is the selection rule proper?

The computation complexity is quite high since it is quadratic to both the number of samples and the number of features comparing with most of baseline methods.
The application to the PneumoniaMNIST dataset is quite interesting. However, the way of presenting the outcomes can be improved significantly.  For example, what is the interested region? how many selected features are in the interested region? How do other compared methods perform? The validation is not quantified. How many radiologists are involved in the evaluation?  What is the performance measured? These plots shown in Fig. 2 delivers less useful information except that more red points are accumulated in the center when the number of selected features increases.

### Summary

2. The results of the proposed method seem better than other ones.

### Weaknesses
1. Most of the compared methods are out-of-date, only one method used for comparison was publised in 2023, other methods are before 2020;
2. The motivation of the proposed method is not clear. In Eq.(8), the first three terms have been well explained, but the final regularization term has not been explained.
