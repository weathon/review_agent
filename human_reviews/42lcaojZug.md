## Abstract
The learning-based video compression method has made significant progress in recent years, exhibiting promising compression performance compared with traditional video codecs. However, prior works have primarily focused on advanced compression architectures while neglecting the rate control technique. Rate control can precisely control the coding bitrate with optimal compression performance, which is a critical technique in practical deployment. To address this issue, we present a fully neural network-based rate control system for learned video compression methods. Our system accurately encodes videos at a given bitrate while enhancing the rate-distortion performance. Specifically, we first design a rate allocation model to assign optimal bitrates to each frame based on their varying spatial and temporal characteristics. Then, we propose a deep learning-based rate implementation network to perform the rate-parameter mapping, precisely predicting coding parameters for a given rate. Our proposed rate control system can be easily integrated into existing learning-based video compression methods. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves accurate rate control on several baseline methods while also improving overall rate-distortion performance.

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This is a paper that describes a method to add adaptive rate control to a variable rate neural video codec.

IIUC it works as follows:

1. train a NVC with variable lambda support.
2. train a "rate implementation network" that can predict a lambda matching some target rate R_t.
3. train a "rate allocation network" that predicts R_t such that we get good rate distortion characteristics over a group of frames (Eq 5).

### Strengths
The authors present their idea well, and it was relatively easy to understand (although it would have been nice to have a high level summary of how the components are trained before going into the details in Sec. 3.4, eg., a list like what I wrote in "Summary" above).

The method is ablated on multiple baseline methods, and achieves significant gains throughout.

Various parts of the method are ablated and shown to be effective.

Overall, the paper has a clear simple idea that is easy to follow, and shows that it works well.

### Weaknesses
My only gripe is it is a bit hard to follow the details and notation, since a lot of symbols are introduced (for example, we have R_mg, R_tar, R_coded, R_t, \hat R_t, R_coded_m). Not all are wlel introduced (eg \hat R_t was only used in the figure before it appeared in the text).

I think the clarity of the text could be improved by either simplyfying the notation, or replacing some of the notation with a description.

### Questions
It was unclear to me why we need two stages to trainallocation and implementation. Could we not train them jointly? Basically one blackbox that takes as input the R_tar (target over group of frames) and predicts \lambda t such that \hat R_t is as desired.

### Summary
This paper proposes a rate control method for learning based video compression. The proposed method is plug-and-play and consists of a rate allocation network and a rate implementation network. Experiments on multiple baseline models show that this method can accurately control the output bitrate. In addition, benefiting from more reasonable rate allocation, this method can also bring certain performance improvements.

### Strengths
1. The most important contribution of this paper is to propose a framework for designing rate control models for learning based video compression. And it is proved that this framework design is better than the rate control strategy designed based on empirical mathematical models.
2.	This paper demonstrates the broad applicability of the framework and provides a reasonable training method.
3.	The paper is clearly and understandably presented.

### Weaknesses
1.	The ablation of specific module design is not very sufficient. Could you give an ablation to explain the impact of introducing frame information?
2.   It's better to show the performance impact of different miniGoPs in the experimental section.

### Questions
1. Why there is a quality fluctuation with a period of 4 in figure 7? Is this related to the hyperparameter settings of miniGoP?
2. In figure 7, compared to the method without rate allocation, the code rate fluctuation seems to be greater. It's better to further explain the reason for this phenomenon?

### Summary
The paper presents a new method for rate control for neural video compression. The method works by adding two new modules to standard learned video compression architectures. The first module is a "rate allocation" module, which attempts to get the average rate for a mini group of pictures to match the overall target rate specified by the user. The second module is a "rate implementation" module, which outputs frame-dependent lambda parameters for controlling the trade-off between rate and distortion. In numerical experiments the paper shows that the new rate control module effectively alters the rate for a suite of learned video compression methods from previous papers. Furthermore, the rate control scheme actually yields an improvement in BD-rate performance for all the methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a new method for rate control, which is a notable open problem in the field of learned compression.
2. The proposed rate control method allows some adaptability between frames so the overall codec can hit the target rate.
3. The proposed rate control method outperforms previous hand-crafted rate control methods applied to learned video compression. About a 10% compression gain is observed for most models.
4. The proposed rate control method can be applied to existing neural codecs. The paper demonstrates its application to four relevant methods from the last few years.
5. The paper is clearly presented and is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the paper does not seem to consider all relevant literature, particularly the ELF-VC method for rate control with one-hot coded label maps (Rippel, 2021). ELF-VC is a number of years old at this point and fairly well cited, but it is not referenced in the present paper. The Rippel method would use integer-based quality levels, which is essentially identical to the standard in traditional video codecs. The present method allows specific rate targeting, which is more advanced, but still I think previous methods for rate control should be considered.

### Questions
1. Did you consider simple one-hot label maps as an alternative rate control mechanism? Even classical codecs are typically controlled by "quality level" parameters rather than target rates, so the rate targeting mechanism in the present work is non-standard.
2. Why does the hyperbolic model accuracy improve as the frame index increases?
3. Does the rate control method work out-of-domain?

### Summary
This paper proposes a learnt architecture for rate control in video compression. This is achieved by the rate control module to automatically assign the weights for consecutive frames and then allocate bit-rates according to the budget. Then, a bit-rate implementation network is proposed to output the hyper-parameter \lambda to achieve the RD trade-off, in which the allocated bit-rate can be truly consumed. Since the bit-rate allocation and implementation modules are learnt by two stages, the proposed method is the plug-and-play method to control the bit-rates for different learnt video compression codecs. The experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The learnt rate control module has been proposed in this paper, which is able to control the bit-rate in a plug-and-play style.
2. The bit-rate implementation network also contributes to the rate control of learnt video compression method.
3. The experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed plug-and-play method, against 4 learnt video compression methods.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper claims that the proposed method is the first fully neural network for rate control in learnt video compression. Please elaborate more on this, given that many learnt methods available to achieve the rate control for learnt video compression, e.g., [1]. 
2. The proposed method is trained in separate stages, which are with limited contributions by my side. It is the fact that many rate control methods aim to fit closed-form mathematical models, e.g., R-\lambda, R-\rho and R-Q models. The proposed bit-rate allocation module essentially can be regarded to learn to implicitly fit the R-\lambda model. If so, the comparison with closed-form models should also be reported, for example, against HEVC and VTM as also mentioned in the paper.
3. I am surprised by the reported experimental results, whereby the RD performances could be further improved by adding rate control scheme. The target bit-rates were obtained by optimizing R+\lambda D with constant \lambda, which means the achieved D now should be the lowest distortion given the target bit-rate R and constant \lambda. The proposed method controls the bit-rates by adjusting \lambda, which in my opinion is supposed to perform inferior to the non-rate-control method. Why adding rate control can further improve the RD performance?
