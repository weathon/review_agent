## Abstract
Diffusion models achieve great success in generating diverse and high-fidelity images. The performance improvements come with low generation speed per image, which hinders the application diffusion models in real-time scenarios. While some certain predictions benefit from the full computation of the model in each sample iteration, not every iteration requires the same amount of computation, potentially leading to computation waste. In this work, we propose DeeDiff, an early exiting framework that adaptively allocates computation resources in each sampling step to improve the generation efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a timestep-aware uncertainty estimation module (UEM) for diffusion models which is attached to each intermediate layer to estimate the prediction uncertainty of each layer. The uncertainty is regarded as the signal to decide if the inference terminates. Moreover, we propose uncertainty-aware layer-wise loss to fill the performance gap between full models and early-exited models. With such loss strategy, our model is able to obtain comparable results as full-layer models. Extensive experiments of class-conditional, unconditional, and text-guided generation on several datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency trade-off compared with existing early exiting methods on diffusion models. More importantly, our method even brings extra benefits to baseline models and obtains better performance on CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A datasets.  Full code and model are released for reproduction.

### Summary
This study presents an early-exit method designed to speed up the inference process in diffusion probability models. At the heart of this approach is an uncertainty estimation module, which quantifies uncertainty in terms of prediction error. The model is designed to terminate the inference process at the layer once the uncertainty surpasses a pre-set threshold. To enhance performance and minimize the discrepancy between predictions made through early exit and those using the full model, the paper introduces an uncertainty-aware, layer-wise loss for training the diffusion model. Empirical evaluations conducted on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-256, and MS-COCO-256 have yielded encouraging results.

### Strengths
1. The concept of an early exit strategy presents a practical and effective approach to accelerating diffusion models. This idea is notably complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as efficient sampling.
2. The paper thoroughly investigates its hypotheses through extensive experiments on several well-known benchmarks, including ImageNet and COCO.
3. The manuscript is commendably well-written, featuring clear illustrations and well-defined formulations.

### Weaknesses
This is a solid work, but I still have some concerns about the novelty and fairness.

1. There is notable prior research in the area of early exiting within diffusion models, such as the study presented at the ICML-23 workshop [1]. This context suggests that the novelty of the current paper might be somewhat constrained, though it undoubtedly contributes to the ongoing discourse in the field.
2. Regarding the comparisons made in Table 1, I would like to express some reservations about their fairness. For instance, the adaptation methods of BERxiT and CALM for diffusion models aren't entirely clear. Also, there are some setting difference between the proposed method and S-Pruning [2], which uses a 100-step DDIM and a smaller UNet (6.1G MACs). But the proposed method employs a 1000-step Euler-Maruyama SDE sampler with a larger network (11.97 GFLOPS). Besides, It would be greatly appreciated if the authors could clarify whether the GFLOPS mentioned are synonymous with Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs). A detailed explanation of how GFLOPS are calculated would be helpful, particularly since many popular libraries, such as PyTorch-opcounter [3] computes MACs by default.
3. The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware layer-wise loss, enhancing the DDPM objective by prioritizing steps with small uncertainty. However, given that diffusion models typically show lower prediction errors in earlier steps, as illustrated in Figure 3, does this mean that the proposed loss method just simply focuses more on these initial steps? Also, I'd like to gently point out a possible minor error in Figure 3, where step 0 is actually the final step [4] rather than initial step.
4. The citation format can be improved. There are several citation issues such as "Ho et al. Ho et al. (2020)" (Bellow Eqn 3),  " S-PruningFang et al. (2023)" (The baseline subsection in 4.1).

### Summary
The paper proposes DeeDiff to accelerate diffusion model generation. Specifically, DeeDiff employs an early exiting strategy where the output can be directly derived from the early layers at different timesteps based on the uncertainty estimation module (UEM). Experiments are conducted on CIFAR, ImageNet, and MS-COCO with FID score to show its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The paper makes an pioneering investigation of early exiting with Diffusion Model which is of novelty.
2. The proposed method is effective with reported FID closer to the full-size model at around 40% FLOPs reduction, outperforming the other early exiting methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiment results are not convincing. 
    - the paper claims that their method reduces the inference time by up to 40%, while the results section only presents the FLOPs reduction. It is obvious that run-time speedup can not be directly represented by the theoretical FLOPs reduction, and thus the claim is falseful. In fact, with these overheads, it is hard to know how much actual speedup this method can bring.
    - the most noticeable capability of a diffusion model, text-guided generation, is not well evaluated. Only FID score is shown, while not a single visual figure is shown. Also, the image-text alignment is not evaluated which is another widely-used metric to assess diffusion model's quality.
2. The presentation lacks clarity.
    - in Figure 4, I have 0 idea what it is about. What does the level of grayness mean? Where are the uncertainty maps from? It makes me hard to understand the analysis.
    - the methodology presented in Section 3.2 is also not clear to me. Since there are 2 dependent indices, $t$ and $i$, it is worthwhile to mention the dependency for the matrices of $w_t$, $b_t$, and $g_i$. Specifically, is $g_i$ first learned and then fixed afterwards for learning $w_t$ and $b_t$? It looks to me $g_i$ shall be fixed first to ensure a low $\hat{u}_{i,t}$ or otherwise the learning seems incorrect to me. It would be good to present a flow-chart/figure to understand the learning scheme for these parameters as well.

### Summary
This paper proposes a early exiting framework for accelerating diffusion models.  The authors propose a timestep-aware uncertainty estimation module given the multistep sampling, and an uncertainty-ware layer-wise to fill the performance gap.

### Strengths
The authors extend the early exiting approaches to the diffusion models, which considers the feature of multistep sampling of diffusion models. The proposed method shows promising results in accelerating diffusion models.

### Weaknesses
1.	The training cost. It seems the costs brought by the UEM loss and the layer-wise loss are high. It seems the method needs to backward at each layer. It’d be better to clarify the extra costs brought by the proposed method. Besides, discusssion about the scalability might also be important, i.e., is the method suitable for large diffusion models such as stable diffusion.
2.	Maybe the comparison to some heuristic settings is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aumoted exiting mechanism. For example, exit at a fixed layer for all inputs.

### Summary
Taking the spirit of early existing techniques in transformers, the paper proposes to extend it to diffusion models. To enable early existing, the paper introduces an uncertainty estimation module (UEM) to characterize the sampling uncertainty at each layer, and an uncertainty-weighted loss to better integrate the UEM in the network. Empirically the proposed DeeDiff framework improves the sample efficiency across datasets.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces an uncertainty estimation module and layer-wise loss in order to enable the early existing in diffusion models.

- Experimentally, the proposed method improved over the baseline across datasets in terms of sample efficiency.

### Weaknesses
- Learning the targeted error $\hat{u}_{i,t}$ in Eq.10 appears to be a very challenging task. I am skeptical that the simplistic one-layer neural network presented in Eq.8 cannot capture the per-sample uncertainty. My guess is that the UEM may only learn a sample-independent value. In this case, the UEM module is effectively a simple pruning technique. Could the authors provide a more empirical analysis of the UEM module?

- (continuing on the point above) I'm not surprised that the model trained with the layer-wise loss (Ours w/o EE) can provide better performance if the UEM module is actually doing the simple pruning. On these simple datasets considered in this paper (CIFAR-10, CelebA), people often observe performance gain after shrinking the architecture. For example, in EDM [1] Table 7, reduce the number of layers in the original config. B to config. C-F improves the performance. 

- I don't think "Ours w/o EE" can improve over the baseline in more complicated datasets like ImageNet. Could you also report "Ours w/o EE" on ImageNet-256 and MS-COCO-256? I would imagine the layer-wise loss ("Ours w/o EE") could hurt the overall performance when the network capacity falls short.

- Could the authors provide some description of the BERTxiT and CALM, as well as how they are applied to diffusion models?

- Is the proposed approach limited to transformer architecture? It seems that the proposed method is only applicable to architecture with a constant feature dimensionality. The more popular UNet architecture has a varying feature dimensionality. 

- The notation is a bit unclear: Could you clarify what $g_i$ and $L_{i,t}$ are? To my understanding. $L_{i,t}$ is the output features of the $i$-th layer. It's unclear to me what's the operator $g_i$ on top of $L_{i,t}$.

- Overall, the reviewer feels like the proposed method is simply a layer-wise pruning method, with the error $u_{i,t}$ as the guidance. One simple baseline is to retrain a **smaller** diffusion model from scratch, that uses similar GFLOPs with "Ours" in Table 1, and see how it performs.

### Questions
- Could the authors provide more details for Fig 1? Could you clarify which time's MSE you are reporting? Is this 13-layer Transformer trained with the proposed Layer-wise loss?

- From Fig. 4, it seems that the uncertainty map $u_{i,t}$ is a feature map rather than a real number?

- Is the $u_{i,t}$ fixed in Eq.12? (the training in Eq.10 finishes before Eq.12).
