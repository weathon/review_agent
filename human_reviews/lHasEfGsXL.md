- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have recently attracted much attention and exhibited satisfactory performance due to their superiority in high-order correlation modeling. 
However, it is noticed that the high-order modeling capability of hypergraph also brings increased computation complexity, which hinders its practical industrial deployment.
In practice, we find that one key barrier to the efficient deployment of HGNNs is the high-order structural dependencies during inference.
In this paper, we propose to bridge the gap between the HGNNs and inference-efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) to eliminate the hypergraph dependency of HGNNs and thus reduce computational complexity as well as improve inference speed. 
Specifically, we introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN$^+$ for fast inference with low complexity. LightHGNN directly distills the knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs via soft labels, and LightHGNN$^+$ further explicitly injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing.
Experiments on eight hypergraph datasets demonstrate that even without hypergraph dependency, the proposed LightHGNNs can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and outperform vanilla MLPs by $16.3$ on average. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets further show the average best performance of our LightHGNNs compared with all other methods.
Experiments on synthetic hypergraphs with 5.5w vertices indicate LightHGNNs can run $100\times$ faster than HGNNs, showcasing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.

### Summary
This paper extends graph knowledge distillation to hypergraphs and achieves significant improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, experiments on synthetic hypergraphs indicate LightHGNNs can run 100× faster than HGNNs, showing their ability for latency-sensitive deployments.

### Strengths
- This is the first work to explore the knowledge distillation on hypergraphs.
- The experiments in the paper are adequate, especially the results on the inference efficiency.
- The paper is well-written and presented.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of comparison with SOTA GNN-to-MLP KD methods such as NOSMOG [1].
- From the results in Tables 1 and 2, it seems that LightHGNN only achieves comparable rather than (significantly) better results than HGNN. Can the authors explain more about this?
- I read subsections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 carefully and realized that the reliability quantification and sampling (which I understand to be the core design of this paper) seem to be very similar to RKD. In my opinion, it's okay to extend designs of previous work to hypergraphs, but it's better to add proper citations and clarify which parts are similar and which parts are the main contributions of this paper.
- Most of the datasets used in this paper are small, and the authors are encouraged to demonstrate effectiveness on more large-scale datasets.
- Can the authors explain more about how the proposed method captures high-order correlations? I think more discussions on the differences between hypergraph KD and general graph KD can greatly enhance the readability and contribution of the paper.

### Summary
In this study, the authors introduce LightHGNN and LightHGNN+, two models aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Hypergraph Neural Networks. 

These models bridge the gap with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), eliminating hypergraph dependencies and significantly improving computational efficiency. 

Experimental results demonstrate that LightHGNNs achieve competitive or superior performance, showcasing their effectiveness and speed in hypergraph-based inference.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-structured and the proposed methods including reliable hyperedge quantification and sampling strategy are clearly explained, with the appendix giving additional relevant details.
2. Clearly labelled figures and visualisations, such as Figures 2, 3, S1, S2, enhance the comprehension of the presented concepts.
3. The efficacy of LightHGNN in knowledge distillation is demonstrated across three settings: transductive, inductive, and production.
4. The proposed methods showcase inventive problem-solving abilities by filling gaps in existing approaches, particularly in the domain of knowledge distillation for hypergraphs.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper only evaluates a single baseline model for hypergraphs, Hypergraph Neural Network [Feng et al., 2019], without exploring knowledge distillation in more recent advanced methods that compute hyperedge embeddings [e.g., Wang et al. (2023), Chien et al. (2022)].
2. Additional experiments, particularly investigating deep LightHGNN$^{+}$ models with varying hidden layers (e.g., 2, 3, ..., 10), are necessary to substantiate the assertion that LightHGNN$^{+}$ effectively combats over-smoothing.
3. The datasets utilised in this research, as outlined in Table S2, are relatively small in size, which diminishes the persuasiveness of knowledge distillation due to the absence of large-scale data.

### Questions
1. What criteria were considered while selecting the baseline Hypergraph Neural Network? 
2. How does this restricted choice impact the overall diversity and representation of neural models applied to hypergraphs?
3. Were there any specific metrics or criteria that would be considered as indicators of effective combating of over-smoothing in the context of deep LightHGNN$^{+}$ models with varying hidden layers, e.g., 2, 3, ..., 10?
4. In the event that the experiments confirm the effectiveness of deep LightHGNN$^{+}$ models in combating over-smoothing, what implications might this have for the broader research community?
5. How might findings on over-smoothing resistance inform future research directions or practical applications in the context of knowledge distillation from hypergraph neural networks?
6. Given the small size of the datasets, what steps were taken to ensure that the findings and conclusions drawn from these datasets can be generalised to larger, real-world scenarios, e.g., (hyper)graphs that cannot fit into GPU memory?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method called LightHGNN to enhance the efficiency of Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs). The proposed LightHGNN bridges the gap between HGNNs and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to eliminate the dependency on hypergraph structure during inference, reducing computational complexity and improving inference speed. LightHGNN distills knowledge from teacher HGNNs to student MLPs using soft labels. Additionally, LightHGNN+ injects reliable high-order correlations into the student MLPs to achieve topology-aware distillation and resistance to over-smoothing. Experimental results show that LightHGNNs achieve competitive or better performance than HGNNs, even without hypergraph dependency.

### Strengths
The idea of using hyperedge quantification and sampling is interesting.

The paper is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The idea of using distillation to improve the efficiency of neural networks is not new, even in the field of Graph Neural Networks. This work is an implementation of this idea to Hypergraph Neural Networks. Though the author claims that some special designs should be considered as the technical contributions of this paper, the general novelty of this paper is borderline.

### Questions
1. Though the  LightHGNN and  LightHGNN+ models are distilled from the HGNN model, their performance is sometimes even better than the original teacher HGNN. May the author explain why this happens?

2. The author claims that LightHGNN+ is able to capture the topology information, it is expected that  LightHGNN+ should thus perform better than  LightHGNN. However, there is not general superiority of  LightHGNN+ over  LightHGNN. May the author explain why?

### Summary
The authors demonstrate that a Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN), which is specifically designed for hypergraph-structured data, can be effectively distilled into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). To this end, the authors extend a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) distillation technique (Wu et al. 2023) to accommodate hypergraphs.

### Strengths
S1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.

S2. It seems that the authors are the first to distill hypergraph neural networks into MLPs, resulting in a significant improvement in speed with only little sacrifice in accuracy.

S3. The proposed method is a logical extension of (Wu et al. 2023)

### Weaknesses
W1. First and most importantly, (a) the importance of reliability-based sampling and (b) the effectiveness of the proposed methodology of measuring the reliability need to be demonstrated empirically and/or theoretically. To achieve this, a comparison should be made between the proposed method and alternative approaches, including (a) utilizing all hyperedges without reliability-based sampling and (b) relying on node reliability (Wu et al. 2023).

W2. The empirical results are limited to HGNN, which is one of the most basic hypergraph neural networks. The authors need to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed distillation method across a broader range of hypergraph neural networks , including more advanced ones (e.g., UNIGCN2 and AllSet).

W3. Furthermore, there is scope to explore the generalizability of the proposed method across a wider range of scenarios by incorporating additional downstream tasks (e.g., hyperedge prediction) and diverse datasets. Currently, the most hypergraphs are obtained from bibliographic data.
