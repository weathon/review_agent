- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 5, 8, 3, 8, 5

## Abstract
The advent of large pre-trained models has brought about a paradigm shift in both visual representation learning and natural language processing. However, clustering unlabeled images, as a fundamental and classic machine learning problem, still lacks an effective solution, particularly for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel image clustering pipeline that leverages the powerful feature representation of large pre-trained models such as CLIP and cluster images effectively and efficiently at scale. We first developed a novel algorithm to estimate the number of clusters in a given dataset. We then show that the pre-trained features are significantly more structured by further optimizing the rate reduction objective. The resulting features may significantly improve the clustering accuracy, e.g., from 57\% to  66\% on ImageNet-1k. Furthermore, by leveraging CLIP's multimodality bridge between image and text, we develop a simple yet effective self-labeling algorithm that produces meaningful text labels for the clusters. Through extensive experiments, we show that our pipeline works well on standard datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k. It also extends to datasets without predefined labels, such as LAION-Aesthetics and WikiArts.

### Summary
The paper presents a unified approach for integrating feature learning with clustering processes. Its novel method for selecting the optimal number of clusters enhances the practicality of KNN and similar clustering methods for large-scale data, even when using computationally intensive models like CLIP. Additionally, it achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets.

### Strengths
1- SOTA results
2- I find that enhancing KNN methods – whether by improving their scalability, representation, or explainability – is valuable. 
3- Good visual analysis Fig 3 and 4.

### Weaknesses
1- The paper's flow is somewhat challenging to follow.
2- The acronym MLC is initially mentioned in the contributions section without prior definition, leading to initial confusion, though its relation to previous works becomes clearer later in the paper.
3- While the method appears to be a practical extension of MLC, its level of novelty and contribution to the field is not distinctly evident.

### Questions
1- The complexity added by Equation 4 to the optimization process isn't clear. Is it possible for there to be multiple optimal values for K?
2- Could a simpler method, like the elbow method, be used to determine K?
3- A brief explanation of what "more-structured representation" means in the context of related works would be helpful.

### Summary
The submission introduces a new image clustering pipeline named CPP, which leverages large pre-trained models like CLIP to efficiently and effectively cluster images, particularly on large-scale datasets. The authors propose to estimate the optimal number of clusters in a dataset and optimize the rate reduction objective using pre-trained features, resulting in a notable improvement in clustering accuracy (e.g., from 57% to 66% on ImageNet-1k). Furthermore, by utilizing CLIP's multimodal capabilities, a simple yet effective self-labeling algorithm is developed to generate meaningful text labels for the clusters. The pipeline demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various standard datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k, and extends its applicability to datasets without predefined labels like LAION-Aesthetics and WikiArts.

### Strengths
1. **Leveraging Large Pre-trained Models**: The integration of the powerful image encoder from CLIP into the clustering framework MLC significantly enhances the pipeline’s ability to process and analyze images, leading to state-of-the-art clustering performance on various datasets.

2. **Improvement in Clustering Accuracy**: Through the optimization of the rate reduction objective using pre-trained features, the pipeline achieves a noticeable improvement in clustering accuracy, as demonstrated on ImageNet-1k.

3. **Self-Labeling Algorithm**: The pipeline includes a simple yet effective self-labeling algorithm that leverages CLIP’s vision-text capabilities, resulting in semantically meaningful clusters that are comprehensible to humans.

### Weaknesses
1. **Limited Innovation in Methodology**: The main innovation of the proposed method seems to be centered around utilizing features extracted by CLIP for initialization, but there appears to be a lack of novelty in the algorithmic aspect of the approach.
2. **Concerns about Stability and Sensitivity**: As depicted in Fig.4, the vicinity of the extreme points in model selection appears quite flat, raising concerns about the algorithm's stability and its sensitivity to perturbations, such as the choice of hyperparameters and network architecture.
3. **Potential Information Leakage**: Given that CLIP has been trained on vast amounts of data, there is a suspicion of cluster/label information leakage in almost all of the experimental data (CIFAR and ImageNet) presented, which could potentially bias the quantitative results.
4. **Lack of Adequate Metrics for Text Labeling**: While the automated text annotation aspect of the pipeline is interesting, it seems to be lacking appropriate metrics to adequately evaluate and validate its performance.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel method that leverages the rate reduction principle to learn to do image clustering using pretrained models. A technique for automatically select the optimal number of clusters is also proposed based on the same principle. Finally, a self-labeling mechism is proposed to label the clusters with semantic labels.
Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a good performance, as well as give a good estimation of the optimal number of clusters.

### Strengths
1. This paper provides an alternative way of performing image clustering, which seems to be performing well and could be of interesting for the community.
2. The method enables automatic estimation of the optimal number of clusters in a dataset, from the result the method seems to perform pretty well.

### Weaknesses
1. The main experiments are done on somewhat small datasets like CIFAR, or coarse grained dataset like COCO, the paper would be stronger if it could include finer-grained dataset for clustering like iNaturalist.

### Questions
1. I would be interesting in how the method perform on fine-grained datasets.
2. It would be better if the paper could include results of using other variant of CLIP models, such OpenCLIP.

### Summary
This paper studies the image clustering problem in the age of large pre-trained models. Specifically, this paper develops a method to determine the cluster number in a given dataset. Then, this paper validates that the features from large pretrained models, such as CLIP, help achive better custering accuracy than the traditional feature pre-training. Moreover, this paper also develops a self-labeling method to produce text labels for the clusters. Experiments on many image datasets, including ImageNet-1k, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- This paper achieves state-of-the-art results on many image datasets, including ImageNet-1k.

### Weaknesses
Three main technique contributions are developed in this paper, including a method to determine the cluster number, a validation that the features from CLIP push the limits of image clustering, and a self-labeling method to annotate the text-labels for the clusters. I have three concerns about these three technique contributions:

- This paper seems did not discuss the existing methods to determine the cluster number and the difference among them. Do all the existing clustering methods not discuss how to determine the cluster number?
- The proposed clustering method is a simple combination between CLIP features and MLC optimization method. I realize it is meaningful to validate the superiority of CLIP features in image clustering, but the technique contribution itself is kind of subtle.
- A self-labeling method to annotate the text-labels for the clusters in *Algorithm 2* simply uses a cosine similarity metric to determine which texts are the closest ones given text candidates, which is a very simple solution. It does not meet my expectations that the proposed self-labeling method strongly relies on the pre-define text candidates. What if the text candidates are not given?
