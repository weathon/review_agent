# Robust Self-supervised Learning in Heterogeneous Graph Based on Feature-Topology Balancing

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
In recent years, graph neural network (GNN) based self-supervised learning in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has gathered considerable attention. Most of the past studies followed a message passing approach where the features of a central node are updated based on the features of its neighboring nodes. Since these methods depend on informative graph topology and node features, their performance significantly deteriorates when there is an issue in one factor. Moreover, since real-world HINs are highly noisy and validating the importance of attributes is challenging, it is rare to find cases where both the graph topology and node features are of good quality. To address this problem, we make the first model that can explicitly separate the graph topology and features in the heterogeneous graph by proposing the novel framework BFTNet (robust self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning using the Balance between node Features and graph Topology). BFTNet employs a knowledge graph embedding module focusing on global graph topology and a contrastive learning module dedicated to learning node features. Thanks to the novel structure that handles graph topology and node features separately, BFTNet can assign higher importance to one factor, thereby allowing it to effectively respond to skewed datasets in real-world situations. Moreover, BFTNet can improve performance by designing the optimal module suited for learning the topology and features, without sacrificing the performance of one modality to reflect the characteristics of the other modality. Lastly, BFTNet implemented a novel graph conversion scheme and representation fusion method to ensure that the representation of topology and features are effectively learned and integrated. The self-supervised learning performance of BFTNet is verified by extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets, and the robustness of BFTNet is demonstrated with the experiments on noisy datasets. The source code of BFTNet will be available in the final version.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper innovatively separates the learning of graph structure and node features, enhancing the model's capacity to distill rich information from both domains and optimize node embeddings. These advanced embeddings notably bolster performance in tasks like classification and clustering within IMDB, ACM, and MAG datasets. Crucially, the model demonstrates resilience when encountering unreliable information sources.

### Strengths
S1: The paper pioneers an approach that explicitly balances node feature and structure relevance in HIN learning under noisy conditions, addressing an authentic and ubiquitous challenge in real-world data scenarios. \
S2: Through empirical testing across diverse datasets, the proposed model not only registers substantial performance gains but also surpasses existing methods in robustness, validating its practical applicability. \
S3: The paper is commendable for its clarity, logical organization, and compelling presentation, making complex concepts accessible and the narrative persuasive. \
S4: The proposed model exhibits potential for scalability and adaptation to other types of networks or learning paradigms, making it a valuable reference point for future research endeavors. Its foundational concept is a launchpad for further explorations into HINs beyond the scope of the current study.

### Weaknesses
W1: The discussion on related works is sparse, especially considering that the balance between node features and graph structure isn't a novel concept in GNN research. A more detailed comparison with foundational works like [1] and [2] would better position and differentiate the paper's contributions within the field. \
W2: The paper introduces pivotal hyper-parameters alpha and beta without substantial exploration or practical guidelines for their optimization. This oversight diminishes the model's real-world utility. Incorporating a mechanism for their automatic adjustment, possibly based on mutual information or a related metric, could substantially augment the method's practicality. \
W3: The robustness assessment is limited, focusing on feature masking and edge-dropping. This narrow scope fails to fully stress-test the model's resilience. Expanding the range of adversarial challenges, including sophisticated strategies like MetaAttack [3], random feature corruption, or edge manipulation, would offer a more holistic robustness evaluation. \
W4: There is no substantial discussion on the model's computational demands. For real-world applications, particularly in larger, more complex networks, resource constraints are a vital consideration. The absence of this evaluation is a missed opportunity to understand the model's performance in resource-restricted environments.

### Summary
This work employs a knowledge graph embedding module focusing on global graph topology and a contrastive learning module dedicated to learning node features. Thanks to the novel structure that handles graph topology and node features separately, the proposed method assigns higher importance to one factor, thereby allowing it to effectively respond to skewed datasets in real-world situations. Moreover, the proposed method improves performance by designing the optimal module suited for learning the topology and features, without sacrificing the performance of one modality to reflect the characteristics of the other modality.

### Strengths
1. This work proposes to simultaneously capture the information in the graph topology and the information in the node features, which is reasonable.

2. Extensive comparison experiments and robustness experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method aims to separately learn the information in the graph topology and node features by the contrastive learning module and the knowledge graph embedding module, respectively. However, the knowledge graph embedding module seems also involves in the node features.

2. The novelty of the proposed method is relatively low. The contrastive learning module is the same as the InfoNCE loss in previous methods. Moreover, directly align the topology-based representations and feature representations seems not very reasonable.

3. The proposed method lacks theoretical analysis. For example. Why the proposed method can outperform the previous methods, are there any theoretical supports?

4. Does the proposed framework in this paper really enable topological maps and node features to complement each other, and are there any case studies to validate this?

5. The writing of the proposed method needs more improvements, and the manuscripts needs more proofreading. For example, 
in page 6, "six Self-supervised heterogeneous models" should be "six self-supervised heterogeneous models".
It's best not to take a direct screenshot of the framework figure.

6. Too few comparison methods, especially lack of 2023 updates.

7. This work was not provided in code, making it difficult to measure its reproducibility.

Based on the above comments, I think that the work does not meet the ICLR thresholds.

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework called BFTNet for robust self-supervised learning in heterogeneous graphs. The framework separates the graph topology and node features, allowing it to effectively handle skewed datasets and improve performance without compromising either modality. The proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating its robustness even in noisy environments.

### Strengths
1. This paper highlights a novel graph conversion scheme as well as representation fusion methods employed within BFTNet that ensure effective learning integration between topology and features.
2. This paper addresses key challenges in self-supervised learning on complex heterogeneous graphs.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper does not discuss potential scalability issues or computational complexity associated with implementing BFTNet on large-scale heterogeneous graphs.
2. Limited discussion on the interpretability and explainability of the BFTNet framework. While it is mentioned that BFTNet separates graph topology and node features, allowing for improved performance, there is no in-depth analysis or explanation provided regarding how this separation enhances interpretability or facilitates understanding of the underlying relationships within heterogeneous graphs. This lack of clarity may hinder researchers' ability to fully comprehend and utilize the insights gained from using BFTNet in their own studies.
3. In Experiments, It appears that this paper achieves dominant performance over baselines. However it does not directly point out how to get the results. Is it the maximum value or the average value? Besides, although it is stated that source code for implementing BFTNet will be made available in future versions, at present it remains unavailable, which limits reproducibility.
4. This paper uses masking node features and dropping edges to verify robustness. However, these two ways are too simple. More test, such as Meta attack [1], is needed.
