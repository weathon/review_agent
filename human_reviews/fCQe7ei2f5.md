## Abstract
Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have become increasingly popular for unsupervised tasks such as dimensionality reduction and missing data recovery due to their flexibility and non-linear nature. An importance-weighted version \cite{salimbeni2019deep} of the Bayesian GPLVMs has  been proposed to obtain a lower variational bound. However, this version of the approach is primarily limited to analyzing simple data structures, as the generation of an effective proposal distribution can become quite challenging in high-dimensional spaces or with complex data sets. In this work, we propose an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach to address these issues. By transforming the posterior into a sequence of intermediate distributions using annealing, we combine the strengths of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and VI to explore a wider range of posterior distributions and gradually approach the target distribution. We further propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Experimental results on both toy and image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of lower variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence.

### Summary
The traditional algorithm for learning Bayesian GPLVMs is limited to simple data structure and faces challenges for high-dimensional data. Compared with variational inference (VI), importance-weighted sampling (IS) provides a more directed way of estimating and maximizing the marginal log-likelihood. To increase the effectiveness of this estimator, this paper proposes a sequence of bridge proposal distributions for sampling the latent variable $H$, and develops the corresponding stochastic gradient annealed algorithm. Results on the toy datasets show outstanding performance of AIS compared to other baseline methods. Besides, the new model and algorithm is able to learn the model with missing data and get a better prediction for the unseen data.

### Strengths
* The introduction of a sequence of bridge distribution for the proposal distribution is interesting and effective for increasing the performance of the model
* Maths are introduced step-by-step, which is clear and intuitive.
* Algorithms are presented in a clear way.
* Tables in these paper are good, showing the better performance of the newly propsosed ULA-AIS method compared with other two baselines.

### Weaknesses
* The notation $\tilde p(X, H)$ is a bit confusing since this is actually an estimator of the marginal $p(X)$, but it looks like a joint distribution.
* The claim in the introduction "the dimension of the additional latent variable is limited to one" from the reference paper is only for deep GP. The latent of GPLVM has no such strong drawback.
* Typo: undajusted.
* No definition of the abbreviation: LV-GP or LVGP, MH, HMC.
* Overall, the experiments are okay and the results are good. However, the experiments are not that adequate to fully convince me the validatiy of the new methods with the other two baseline methods. For example, is it possible to compare them on a synthetic dataset that the data is really from GPLVM. By this, we will fully understand the new method improves the learning performance of GPLVM than other traditional solvers, rather than some other reasons.
* In summary, a detailed analysis on these seems to be necessary, since introducing a sequence of bridge distribution for the proposal distribution is delicate, complicated and needs to be thouroughly explained and clarified for readers.
* The quality of the experiment results can be improved, see questions.

### Questions
* Below Eq. 7, what is $q_k(H_{k-1})$? Should that be $q_{k-1}(H_{k-1})$?
* Is the inverse length-scale plot in Fig. 1 shows the result learned by ULA-AIS? Is it possible to also visualize the class label in the left plot, so that it can show us the latent recovery accuracy.
* For Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, what about the reconstruction results from the other two baseline methods? And what about the latent space recovered by the other two baseline methods?
* For Fig. 3 left, the bottom is the true data and the top row is the predicted? Figures in this paper are not explained clearly in their corresponding captions. Color usage, image order, method order, and etc sometimes make me confused.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The manuscript proposes an annealed importance sampling scheme to perform scalable variational inference in Gaussian process latent variable models. A set of experiments on small datasets and two image datasets compares two variational inference algorithms.

### Strengths
* The GPLVM is well-established and a widely used tool.
 * The proposed techniques to achieve efficient sampling is also established.
 * The manuscript comes with code and can hence be easily reproduced.

### Weaknesses
* Motivation
   - The paper does not convincingly motivate potential shortcomings of existing methods that should be overcome by the described approach.
 * Experiments
   - Proper comparison to other models needs to be improved: e.g. comparison to a standard GPLVM or some other simple density model (KDE) is missing.
   - Proper analysis of computational effort missing. Runtime analysis.
 * Typos
   - Abstract: "tighter" rather than "lower"?, VI is undefined
   - Intro: "in high-dimensional spaces"
   - Algorithm 1: "stepsizes" rather than "stepsides"
   - Section 3.1 last paragraph: "It is obvious that", "Therefore, the first three terms"
   - References: Capitalisation needs to be reviewed, e.g. Langevin, Eyring-Kramers, Gaussian, Bayes, Monte Carlo
   - Citations: Please properly distinguish between textual citation and parenthetical citations. In the manuscript, you only use textual citation.

### Questions
* How do you come to the conclusion that your method shows "more robust convergence" as claimed in the contributions at the end of the introduction section? Which experiment backs this claim? Figure 4 shows a strong peak shortly before 600 iterations and a strange decay at 350.
 * Is it fair to compare MSE and NELL after a fixed number of iterations? To me, one should either fix the computational budget or compare after convergence. What happens if you evaluate at 5000 iterations?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to enhance the learning process of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) through the integration of Annealed Importance Sampling within the framework of variational inference. This newly introduced inference methodology is anticipated to provide a more accurate and effective variational approximation, particularly in scenarios involving high-dimensional data. The experimental analysis conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach demonstrates notable improvements over conventional techniques, such as vanilla variational inference and importance-weighted VI.

Specifically, the results indicate that the proposed method achieves a significant reduction in the negative Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), a crucial measure of the model's performance. Moreover, the approach yields a notable enhancement in the expected log likelihood and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of reconstruction, indicating a substantial advancement in the model's ability to accurately represent and reconstruct complex datasets. The evaluation of these results was carried out on diverse datasets, including both digit and face datasets, further highlighting the applicability of the proposed method across various domains.

### Strengths
The paper's well-organized flow introduces GPLVM models, followed by a comprehensive exploration of variational inference methods, including vanilla and importance-weighted schemes. Its main contribution is the introduction of AIS variational inference using Langevin diffusion. This novel approach effectively addresses dimensionality reduction and prediction tasks in high-dimensional data spaces, showcasing its potential and effectiveness in advancing the field.

### Weaknesses
The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive empirical validation, particularly in terms of rigorous experimentation and benchmarking against diverse data sets. Including a broader range of experiments and datasets would provide a more holistic understanding of the proposed AIS-based variational inference methods and their applicability across various contexts.

A more explicit discussion on the assumptions and constraints underlying the AIS variational inference approach would provide a clearer understanding of its potential constraints and practical applicability. This would help in contextualizing the scope and generalizability of the proposed method.

There are several typos in the paper (but not limited to):
(p4) the fisrt three term ==> the first three terms
(p4) jointly optimizes ==> jointly optimize

Addressing these potential weaknesses would not only strengthen the overall credibility of the paper but also provide a more comprehensive and balanced perspective for readers and researchers in the field.

### Questions
For experiments with Oilflow dataset, with only three runs, do you think the standard deviation reliable? 
How many runs for the data reported in Table 2?

### Summary
The paper proposes an Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) approach for Variational Learning of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods in analyzing complex data structures and high-dimensional spaces. The authors introduce a transition density and use a Langevin diffusion to approximate the posterior density. They also propose the usage of the reparameterization trick to simplify gradient computation and suggest employing stochastic gradient descent for sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of variational bounds, log-likelihoods, and convergence robustness.

### Strengths
1. The authors present their contribution alongside a very throrough theoretical discussion. The amount of details provided in the derivation of the proposed method is impressive and it shows the amount of work put forth by the authors.

2. The article is quite well written, and although at some points can be quite dense and difficult to follow, this stems from the amount of information that is trying to be condensed in just a few pages. While this is a double-edge sword and certainly improvements could be made, I think the effort made by the authors is quite clear.

3. The AIS approach allows for the analysis of complex data structures and high-dimensional spaces, which were challenging with previous methods. This increases the applicability and usefulness of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) in various domains by combining Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and Variational Inference (VI). This enables a wider range of posterior distribution exploration, leading to better understanding and modelling capabilities.

4. The authors propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the ELBO, which leads to a simpler gradient computation and therefore an easier process to optimize model parameters during training.

5. In the experiments performed, the authors show that the proposed method outperforms previous models in different aspects related to its tighter variational bounds, higher log-likelihoods, and more robust convergence. This indicates that their proposed approach is effective at capturing underlying patterns in data.

### Weaknesses
1. The usage of annealing techniques as well as MC samplers can mean strong computational demands, especially in high dimensional settings and in complex models. , particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data or complex models. Several experiments are conducted in related settings, and scalability results are only reported in terms of iterations while no information on the hardware used is provided. I expect the authors to provide this information in the final version of the draft.

2. On the same line as the previous point, I expect the authors to release some version of the code used to produce these results. This is not mentioned in the text and I deem reproducibility to be considered an important factor.

3. The selection of hyperparameter values appears to play a crucial role in the performance of the presented method. Finding optimal values for parameters such as step size ($\eta$) or the selected number of bridging densities ($K$) may prove to be expensive and quite important in the final results. Moreover, even though it appears to be more restricted due to their usage, the choice for the evolution of $\beta_k$ coefficients, while contained in $\[0,1\]$ needs to be properly crafted as well.

4. The proposed approach introduces additional complexity compared to traditional methods for Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models. This may make it more challenging to implement and understand, especially for researchers or practitioners with limited experience in this area.

### Minor:

* Considering the information conveyed in the text, I think the article is quite well written. However, at some points, I think it could be managed so that the discussion flows better. I suggest the authors summarize further the introduction in favour of section 2 so that further details can be provided about the required background since currently it is only touched on lightly and some ideas are pivotal here. On this same line, I suggest the authors include further references in the part of the text surrounding Eqs. 2,3 and 4, especially when mentioning something deemed to be "the classical MF-ELBO" or a "typical approximation". These are small points, but I deem them relevant nonetheless.
  
* There seem to be some small typos throughout the text such as "fisrt" on page 4 or using "d" instead of "D" for dimensions on page 7 (e.g. "2d projections" instead of "2D"). I do not consider these important corrections at all since the text is very clean, I only suggest doing a final pass to fix these tiny mishaps.

### Questions
1. How does the current method scale with the amount of data present in terms of running time? What are the computational requirements to run experiments such as the ones presented in the article? 
   
2. How sensitive is the method to different choices of reparameterizations?

3. Can you provide more insights into how the proposed annealing process affects the exploration of posterior distributions? What are some potential trade-offs or considerations when choosing an appropriate annealing schedule?
   
4. The paper mentions that experimental results demonstrate improved performance on toy datasets and image datasets, but what about other types of data or real-world applications? Are there any known limitations or challenges when applying this approach to different domains? How about running experiments for bigger datasets such as Imagenet?
