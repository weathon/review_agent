## Abstract
Unsupervised pretraining, which learns a useful representation using a large amount of unlabeled data to facilitate the learning of downstream tasks, is a critical component of modern large-scale machine learning systems. Despite its tremendous empirical success, the rigorous theoretical understanding of why unsupervised pretraining generally helps remains rather limited---most existing results are restricted to particular methods or approaches for unsupervised pretraining with specialized structural assumptions. This paper studies a generic framework,
where the unsupervised representation learning task is specified by an abstract class of latent variable models $\Phi$ and the downstream task is specified by a class of prediction functions $\Psi$. We consider a natural approach of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for unsupervised pretraining and Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for learning downstream tasks. We prove that, under a mild ``informative'' condition, our algorithm achieves an excess risk of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_\Phi/m} + \sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_\Psi/n})$ for downstream tasks, where $\mathcal{C}\_\Phi, \mathcal{C}\_\Psi$ are complexity measures of function classes $\Phi, \Psi$, and $m, n$ are the number of unlabeled and labeled data respectively. Comparing to the baseline of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_{\Phi \circ \Psi}/n})$ achieved by performing supervised learning using only the labeled data, our result rigorously shows the benefit of unsupervised pretraining when $m \gg n$ and $\mathcal{C}\_{\Phi\circ \Psi} > \mathcal{C}\_\Psi$. This paper further shows that our generic framework covers a wide range of approaches for unsupervised pretraining, including factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning.

### Summary
This paper sets out to provide a theoretical foundation for the benefits of pretraining on unsupervised data in the context of a broader downstream task. The central premise is that an unknown distribution, denoted as $p_{\phi^*}$ and belonging to a known distribution family $\phi^*\in\Phi$, generates pairs of data points $(x,z)$, where $x$ represents the input vector, and $z$ is a latent variable. Labels, or $y$ values, are stochastically determined solely by $z$ through an unknown distribution $p_{\psi^*}$ from a known distribution family $\psi^*\in\Psi$. Consequently, the pretraining procedure utilizes only observations of $x_j$s and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to acquire knowledge of $p(z|x)$, while the fine-tuning stage leverages labeled pairs $(x_i,y_i)$ to learn a straightforward classifier, $p(y|z)$.

Notably, the authors introduce the concept of "informativeness" as a means to theoretically elucidate the learnability of $p(z|x)$ solely from observations of $x_j$s. The paper then goes on to present a set of generalization bounds that, while somewhat expected, offer a fresh perspective. These bounds are demonstrated in three distinct scenarios: 1) Factor models, 2) Gaussian Mixture Models, and 3) Contrastive Learning.

The mathematical analysis in this paper appears rigorous and well-founded, and the presented bounds seem to be a novel contribution. However, my skepticism arises regarding the extent to which this paper advances the theoretical understanding of pretraining, as discussed in the "Weaknesses" section. It's noteworthy that the improved generalization bounds are primarily a result of the significant assumptions made about the data generation process. In simpler terms, the authors first assumed the efficacy of pretraining, and then substantiated their own assumption.

Nonetheless, I believe that this paper could be a valuable addition to the Machine Learning Theory (MLT) community and might meet the standards for acceptance at ICLR. Therefore, my current inclination is toward a weak acceptance. However, I remain open to reconsidering my evaluation if the authors can more effectively emphasize the significance of their work.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-structured and exceptionally clear, making it easy to read. The problem formulation and subsequent results are presented with great clarity. The mathematical derivations appear sound, and the results are in line with expectations.

- The introduction of the concept of $\kappa$-informativeness, which guarantees the learnability of $p(x,z)$ using only observations from $x$, is both innovative and intriguing.

- The authors have skillfully and rigorously framed their problem and have effectively demonstrated their results in three distinct theoretical scenarios: 1) Factor models, 2) Gaussian Mixture Models, and 3) Contrastive Learning.

### Weaknesses
The authors present an analysis of the excess risk associated with a two-stage learning process: first pretraining on a large volume of unlabeled data ($m\gg n$), followed by fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset. Their findings reveal that this excess risk is notably smaller compared to training solely on the initial set of $n$ labeled samples. While the presented bounds are mathematically rigorous and insightful, they do not significantly advance our theoretical understanding of the concept of pretraining per se. In essence, the generalization bounds align with conventional expectations: For a limited $n$ and assuming $m\rightarrow\infty$, the training of a small linear head generlizes far better than training the whole NN, therefore, one would naturally expect:
$\sqrt{\mathrm{complexity}(head)/n}+\sqrt{\mathrm{complexity}(body)/m}\ll \sqrt{\mathrm{complexity}(head+body)/n}.$ 

The authors, in my opinion, do not definitively establish the "advantage" of pretraining, despite the paper's title. In my opinion, the efficacy of unsupervised pretraining primarily stems from its remarkable capacity to mitigate bias, rather than reducing the excess risk. However, the effect of bias is not present in this analysis. The authors postulate the existence of a latent variable, denoted as $z$, which imparts conditional independence between $x$ and $y$. This assumption underpins the essence of pretraining, but the underlying reasons for its practical effectiveness remain elusive. Additionally, the authors rely on the presumption that the "true" joint distribution of $x$ and $z$ adheres to a known class of probability distributions, typically those produced by sufficiently large neural networks, which can be learned using a generic estimator such as MLE. The question of why these assumptions hold in practice and whether they can be theoretically justified remains a mystery, and this study does not provide a resolution to this critical issue.

Due to the aforementioned ungrounded assumptions, particularly in the context of theoretical rigor, the proofs and associated mathematical methodologies in this paper lack enough mathematical sophistication. The derived bounds rely on the application of well-established generalization guarantees pertaining to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).

In light of these concerns, I would suggest to rephrase both the title and abstract of the paper to accurately reflect the highlighted issues.

### Questions
For me, Theorem 5.3 is of independent interest. In your work, the data generation model is assumed to belong to a known distribution family, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model. This setting bears a resemblance to Ashtiani et al. (2018)'s work, where they provided slightly improved bounds for learning Gaussian mixture models, albeit not within the context of pretraining.

Following Ashtiani et al., and adopting the notations used in the present work, the error for the downstream classification task can be bounded as follows:


$\hat{\mathrm{Error}}\leq \mathrm{Error}_{optimal} + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{Kd/m})$

without the term $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K/n})$ which appears in Theorem 5.3 of the present paper. Instead, Ashtiani et al. would require $n\ge\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K)$ (with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hiding poly-logarithmic factors).

However, as previously mentioned, their focus is not on pretraining, and they pursue a fundamentally different approach. Still, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide further insights into the parallels between these works and offer a comparative analysis of the bounds.

### Summary
The paper introduces an algorithm that under a specified "informative" condition significantly improves the baseline complexity achieved by conventional supervised learning, especially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data (m) compared to labeled data (n). The authors present a versatile framework to analyze various unsupervised pretraining models, emphasizing its applicability across different setups like factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning. The primary contributions are:

Excess Risk Bound: The authors present an upper bound on the excess risk associated with an algorithm (Algorithm 1). The risk is expressed in terms of various parameters, including the Rademacher complexity—a measure that quantifies the function class's capacity to fit random noise.

Weakly Informative Models: The paper introduces the concept of models that are $\kappa^{-1}$-weakly-informative. These models, while not being fully informative, are shown to have certain desirable properties. The authors provide a relaxed assumption (Assumption 3.6) which broadens the class of examples by considering both the Total Variation (TV) and Hellinger distances to quantify the discrepancy between the model's outputs and the true distribution.

Performance Guarantees: Crucially, the authors demonstrate that the bounds provided on excess risk remain valid even under the $\kappa^{-1}$-weakly-informative assumption (Theorem 3.7). This insight is significant as it indicates that despite the potential shortcomings of weakly informative models, one can still establish robust performance guarantees for them.

### Strengths
**Originality:** 
The paper's introduction of assumption 3.2 showcases a unique approach in how it lays out its foundational groundwork. This can be seen as a new definition or problem formulation, adding to the originality of the work.

**Quality:** 
The research stands out in its rigor and the depth of its theoretical contributions. The introduction and use of explicit models that unravel all hidden parameters, particularly $\kappa$, underline the paper's commitment to thoroughness and depth.

**Clarity:** 
One of the standout features of this paper is its clarity. The authors smoothly introduce assumption 3.2 via a preceding thought experiment. This structured approach enhances comprehensibility, ensuring that readers are well-prepped before delving into more complex concepts. Furthermore, the theorems provided give a clear indication of the magnitude of parameters involved, aiding readers in understanding the practical implications and boundaries of the proposed methods.

**Significance:** 
The paper's structured and well-organized approach to presenting the setup, theorem, and explicit topic application is commendable. Such an approach not only amplifies the paper's readability but also underscores its significance in serving as a potential benchmark for future works in the domain. By ensuring that readers can seamlessly transition through the content, the authors have amplified the paper's potential impact on its audience.

### Weaknesses
### Weaknesses:

**Over-reliance on Assumption 3.2:** 
The primary weakness of this paper stems from assumption 3.2, which appears to be an overly robust condition. The core challenge of the paper lies in discerning the (constraint) relationship between (x, s) and (x, z). By introducing a new parameter, $\kappa$, to simply constrain this relationship, the paper sidesteps the intricacy of this challenge. While the existence of such a parameter in the three sub-cases presented in the paper is addressed, its presence in more complex scenarios remains questionable. The use of such a strong assumption might detract from the general applicability of the results.

**Potential Pitfalls with Transformation Assumption:** 
A significant concern arises from the implications of assumption 3.2. Based on the assumption, it can be inferred that given
$$\mathbb{P}\_{\phi}(x, s) = \mathbb{P}\_{\phi^*}(x, s),$$
there exists a transformation $T_1$ such that
$$\mathbb{P}\_{T\_1 \circ \phi}(x, z) = \mathbb{P}\_{\phi^*}(x, z).$$

However, when considering mixed uniform distributions over specific cubical sets, these assumptions are immediately invalidated. This limitation highlights potential scenarios where the stated assumption may not be practically applicable.

**Recommendations for Improvement:** 
It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more thorough justification or relaxation of assumption 3.2, possibly exploring weaker conditions that achieve similar results.

### Questions
**Real-world Relevance**: How do the assumptions and theorems presented in the paper translate to real-world applications? Are there any practical scenarios where these findings could be directly applied?

### Summary
This paper provides a generalization of and subsequent analysis for unsupervised pretraining. The provided framework is able to capture a wide variety of unsupervised pretraining methods, of which factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning are more closely analyzed. The main result is a proof that the excess risk of the provided unsupervised algorithm scales by at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{C_\Phi/m} + \sqrt{C_\Psi/n})$, which compares favorably to a baseline supervised learning excess risk under certain regimes.

### Strengths
The presentation is clear. The generic framework provided for unsupervised learning is able to capture a wide variety of unsupervised methods. The theoretical results are able to demonstrate some advantage compared to a baseline supervised learning method.

### Weaknesses
Practical applications are unclear due to assumptions made (such as bounded loss) and the large complexity terms in the bounds. Idealized versions of MLE and ERM are used.

### Questions
The truncation bounds used for the square loss seem very unnatural. Could you explain the use of those particular bounds?

All of the examples are in relatively simple settings (linear functions, separated Gaussian mixtures). Is this due to the way the bounds scale with model/distribution complexity?

Could you explain how you derive the excess risk for the baseline supervised algorithm?

### Summary
This paper develops a framework for understanding the advantages of unsupervised pretraining. The paper factorizes the learning task into two parts: unsupervised pretraining by MLE and supervised learning for downstream tasks via ERM. This paper derives its risk bound via an informative assumption justified by a zero-informative counter-example that any unsupervised pretraining gives no further information. Based on that assumption, the core result is an excess risk bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\text{Complexity of pretraining class}/\text{Unsupervised pretraining samples}} + \sqrt{\text{Complexity of downstream class}/\text{Supervised learning samples}})$. This result prevails the risk guarantee of sole supervised learning when provided with abundant unsupervised pretraining samples. The authors also extend their results with three concrete examples.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

2. This paper provides a general framework for analyzing the benefits of unsupervised pretraining. The "MLE+ERM" approach covers most examples in unsupervised pretraining. The authors also justify the ERM approach by constructing an MLE counter-example.

3. The main result is impressive and natural. Breaking supervised learning's statistical learning bound into two parts is critical to understanding the advantage of unsupervised pretraining.

### Weaknesses
1. The main assumption (Assumption 3.2) is not fully justified. The zero-informative counter-example is solid, but justifying the informative condition by showing "if some example is zero-informative, then the unsupervised pretraining could be useless" is a tautology. In short, the paper's conclusion of the superiority of unsupervised pretraining is built on the presumption of believing the pretraining to be useful. 

2. This paper shows three instances for its framework: factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning. But the last needs more careful handling since it is usually considered a self-supervised learning task. 

3. The contribution of this paper is mainly on the modeling part, while the proof techniques seem standard,

### Questions
1. I wonder if the authors could comment more on justifying Assumption 3.2. I don't mean that "Assumption 3.2 is incorrect"; rather I just want a bit more demonstration on the mechanics behind this informative condition. For example, the authors compute three examples' informative conditions, but are those constants essential to the problem? Any theoretical results (for example, lower bounds of $\Omega(\kappa)$) or empirical ones will do.

2. The third example, contrastive learning (Section 6), seems to differ from the mainstream contrastive learning modeling. A common approach is to assume access to positive pairs $(x_i, x_i^+)$ from the same latent class and negative pairs $(x_i, x_i^-)$, while this paper models it in a somewhat "reverse" way: each sample of the pair $(x, x^\prime)$ is i.i.d. (which is often not satisfied in practice; see HaoChen et al. 2021), and the positive/negative signs are logistically distributed according to their latent similarity. I am not sure if this model is representative of a standard contrastive learning model, and it would be great if the authors could provide more explanations.
