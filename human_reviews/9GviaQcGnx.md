# Constrained Parameter Regularization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 8

## Abstract
In this work, we present constrained parameter regularization (CPR), an alternative to traditional weight decay. Instead of applying a constant penalty uniformly to all parameters, we enforce an upper bound on a statistical measure (e.g., the L2-norm) of parameter groups. Consequently, learning becomes a constraint optimization problem, which we address by an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method. This formulation permits varying regularization strengths for each parameter group, eliminating the need for explicit penalty coefficients for regularization terms. CPR only requires two hyperparameters and incurs no measurable runtime overhead. Additionally, we propose a simple but efficient mechanism to adapt the upper bounds during the optimization. We provide empirical evidence of CPR's efficacy in experiments on the ``grokking'' phenomenon, computer vision, and language modeling tasks. Our results demonstrate that CPR counteracts the effects of grokking and consistently matches or outperforms traditional weight decay.

### Summary
The paper proposes a constrained parameter regularization (CPR) technique that dynamically adjusts its regularization strength on parameters based on the violation of the constraints. The authors address the optimization of CPR by an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method and provide a simple mechanism to adapt the upper bounds during the optimization. The experimental results speak in favor of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper studies a very important field as the performance of modern NNs are often bottlenecked by the underlying optimization and many tricks boil down to easing the optimization difficulty. I found the topic significant and interesting. 
- The design of adjusting the regularization strength dynamically is very interesting and novel.
- The performance of the proposed method looks good in terms of both the average and the best performance. The method is also robust against different design choices of $\kappa$.

### Weaknesses
- Although it is a very interesting paper, I feel like the analysis is not good enough. There are many interesting aspects that could be further explored IMHO. For example:
1. If $\lambda$ is used to accumulate constraint violations, shouldn't it be $\lambda_{t+1}=\lambda_t + \mu(R(\theta_t) - \kappa)^+$? 
2. Have the authors considered adjusting $\lambda$ in a non-linear way? For example $\lambda_{t+1}=\lambda_t + \mu f((R(\theta_t) - \kappa))^+$, where $f$ is a non-linear function. Maybe it leads to faster convergence if tuned properly?
3. Should $\lambda$ have a self decay factor? Similar to a diverging behavior with large learning rates, when a feasible point $\theta_{t}$ is found at a very large $\lambda_t$. In the next iteration, $\theta_{t+1}$ may overshoot in the opposite direction and becomes infeasible again because $\lambda_t$ has not yet become small enough.

- The experimental setting is not very clear to me. What is the percentage of correct labels in the Object Detection experiment? Is the "Object Detection" actually classification on CIFAR100? As "Object Detection" is a well-established field itself, I found the terms very confusing. 

- How significant is the performance difference between CPR and weight decay? As the absolute performance difference is not huge, it would be great if the standard deviation of different runs of the same setting can be provided. 

- Maybe I missed it, but how about a baseline of weight decay factor dependent on the magnitude of the parameters, e.g. larger weights leads to a larger decay coefficient (linear or non-linear dependence)? I wonder how well this could achieve the goal of the proposed method.


Minor:
- Equation 6 should have $\kappa^j$ rather than $\kappa$ 
- The authors claim that the method is not sensitive to $\mu$, but it would still be great to see the analysis on it.
- Better to use consistent notations. E.g. in Figure E1, fix -> Kappa-K, dependent -> Kappa_kI0, warm started ->Kappa_Is
- Larger scale evaluation, e.g. on image-net, would be strongly advised.

### Summary
Summary： The paper proposes an alternative to traditional weight decay, which does not uniformly apply a constant penalty to all parameters. Instead, it enforces an upper bound on statistical measures for parameter groups and addresses this issue through adjustments to an enhanced Lagrangian method. It also allows for different regularization strengths for each parameter group, without the need to explicitly set penalty coefficients for regularization terms.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1） The authors introduce a constrained parameter regularization that does not uniformly 
apply a constant penalty to all parameters.
2） The authors provide an open-source implementation of CPR, which can be easily adjusted 
by replacing the optimizer class.

### Weaknesses
1） The authors should provide a clearer exposition of the problem statement and research 
motivation in the abstract.
2） In the related work section, the authors should provide a more comprehensive review of 
prior research.
3） The experimental results conducted by the authors did not show a significant 
improvement in optimization performance, and they did not provide additional 
experimental results or comparisons related to existing work.
4） While applying different regularization strengths to each parameter group may seem 
intriguing, the authors have not discussed the necessity and potential advantages of this 
approach compared to traditional methods.

### Summary
The paper proposed constrained parameter regularization as an alternative to L2 / weight decay regularization. The paper provided a computationally efficient method, explored different constraints initialization, and delivered experiments on various tasks.

### Strengths
1) The methods allow different constraints for different parameter groups which is not possible to achieve with a traditional approach.
2) No computational overhead and the code is open-source.
3) The approach seems to be effective on different empirical tasks e.g. grokking, object detection, and medical image tasks.

### Weaknesses
1) It’s difficult to find a good value of the upper bound for each group of the parameters.
2) The accuracy gain for the language model is quite small, so it’s not clear to say that AdaCPR is better than AdamW on this task.
3) See questions

### Questions
1) “We can also close the gap between training and validation performance by increasing the weight decay regularization but this comes at the price of unstable training” . Shouldn’t we compare the AdamAdaCPR with AdamW with a bigger regularization parameter? Since our concern here is the grokking effect. 

2) There are large performance drops in Table 3 when the number of warm-start steps increases from 3k to 4k. This increment is not large compared to the total number of training steps is 25k. Does this imply that CPR with Kappa-I_s is highly sensitive to the warm-start parameter?
