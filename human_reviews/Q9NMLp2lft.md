- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)

## Abstract
We propose a novel variant of neural networks, Generalized Convolutional Neural Networks, GConvNets, characterized by structured neurons. In contrast to conventional neural networks such as ConvNets, which predominantly employ 'scalar' neurons, GConvNets utilize structured 'tensor' neurons. In other words, we generalize ConvNets by substituting each scalar neuron in ConvNets with a tensor neuron in GConvNets,  while preserving the weight-sharing mechanism. These structured neurons manifest as tensors with adaptable shapes and dimensions across different layers. To ensure their practical applicability, we have developed a mechanism that enables seamless handling of hybrid structured tensor neurons as they transition from one layer to the next.  We conducted a comparative analysis between GConvNets and the currently popular ConvNets, which include ResNets, MobileNets, EfficientNets, RegNets, among others, using datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet. The experimental results demonstrate that GConvNets exhibit superior efficiency in terms of parameter usage.

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes to use tensors instead of scalars from the beginning.  The authors create a compact network with structured neurons. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

### Strengths
In contrast to the basic operation of ConvNets where linear combinations of scalars is used, the authors proposed to replace scalars to tensors.  The idea is novel and the experimental results show advantage of the proposed methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The main concerns lies in the contribution. The authors merely replace scalars to tensors in the linear combination operation, and the contribution is limited.

2. The motivation is not clear and not convincing.

3. The writing and presentation can be improved.

4. More experiments should be conducted. For example,  different models' experimental results on the same network structures should be compared.

### Questions
Since the proposed method replace scalars to tensors, the parameter number should increase. I'm confusing why the parameter number decreases? How is your model improve performance?

### Summary
Generalized Convolutional Neural Networks (GConvNets) are a proposed variant of neural networks with 'tensor' neurons instead of conventional 'scalar' neurons, allowing for adaptable tensor shapes and dimensions across different layers, while maintaining the weight-sharing feature.

### Strengths
Generalized Convolutional Neural Networks (GConvNets) are a proposed variant of neural networks with 'tensor' neurons instead of conventional 'scalar' neurons, allowing for adaptable tensor shapes and dimensions across different layers, while maintaining the weight-sharing feature.

### Weaknesses
1. Obvious mistakes. E.g. "ConvNets are continually growing in size. A notable example is ChatGPT". This lowers the quality and trustworthy of the paper.
2. 'Generalized CNN' seems to be overclaiming.
3. The core idea in Fig.2 is confusing. Based on understanding from the very limited information, it is just a tensor rewriting of the convolution and not novel.
4. why many figures/Eqn. from other works capsule and transformer network. They seem to have very little connection to the work presented here/

### Questions
1. Is it necessary to include Eqn. of transformers/attention in the related work?
2. " In contrast to conventional neural networks such as ConvNets, which predominantly employ ‘scalar’ neurons, GConvNets utilize structured ‘tensor’ neurons." I do not think this is a correct statement. Otherwise, explain 'scalar' defination.

### Summary
The paper proposes a generalization of ConvNets using tensor processing and names the architecture GConvNets. GConvNets employ tensor operations per neuron compared to scalar operation employed by traditional ConvNets. The paper offers numerical studies on various datasets, comparing against various models. The paper claims that the superior performance of GConvNets is due to its ability to better capture spatial features from inputs and overcome over-parameterization. The paper is well written and has a decent flow. Please see below for detailed strengths and questions on the work.

### Strengths
The paper proposes an interesting idea of generalizing ConvNets using tensor processing. Experimental studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing methods on classification performance and parameter efficiency. More interestingly, the paper claims that the plain convolutions are a spacial case of the proposed tensor processing.

### Weaknesses
Please see below.

### Questions
Please fix the following typos in the paper. I would encourage the authors to go over the paper thoroughly and fix any other typos.
1. Sentence after (1) needs to be modified. Currently it reads "Where $di$ is the length is $K$", which is not comprehendible. 
2. Equation 2 contains a typo -- stt1. 
3. The paper claims that the GConvNets perform better than ConvNets because they are able to better capture spatial features and are less vulnerable to overfitting -- although not vital, it would be great to see visualizations of feature maps to show how diffrent the features of GConvNets are, compared to ConvNets.
4. The paper mentions other works on parameter reduction in CNNs, including pruning, distillation, etc. but fails to cite relevant works or include them in comparisons. Could the authors cite relevant works in the section 1.1 and possible include comparisons with some of these methods (time permitting)?
5. Although the paper shows the #Params in the studies, it would be nice to see inference times also.

### Summary
The paper presents a variant of neural networks, GConvNets for image classification. The major contribution is to use the so called  Generalized Convolutional to replace ordinary convolution. It employs high-rank tensors as the structured neurons and utilize the tensor product as the fundamental operations within the network. It uses parameter sharing within each layer, similar to ordinary convolution. Experiments on several image classification datasets show promising results of the GConvNet.

### Strengths
First, the idea is novel to me. Second, the results seem to be strong, though only on small datasets. The proposed network achieved high accuracy with much fewer parameters than existing methods including well-known ones such as EfficientNet and ConvNext.

### Weaknesses
First, the proposed method is not clearly described. I guess many readers in the AI community are not very much familiar with the tensor product with high ranks, and I'm one of them. Frankly speaking, I searched internet and still didn't get good answer that could match the description and examples well in the paper. It is strange that the paper spends much space for describing the well-known CapsuleNet and Transformer but does not describe the definition of the core of the proposed method clearly -- tensor product. 

Second, the reason why the proposed method works well is not well explained. Throughout the paper, it is stressed that it is the "structured neurons" that bring the advantage of representation. CapsuleNet and Transformers are adopted as an analogy to explain this advantage. To me, this does not make much sense because the high rank tensor operations have little to do with the structures of the two models. BTW, it is hard to say Transformers have structured neurons. 

Third, the efficiency is not reported in the results tables. In sec 4.4 it is stated that the proposed method works very slow. This is expected because the time complexity of tensor product is high. If efficiency is not resolved, the method is hardly to be recognized by the AI community. 

In summary, the proposed method is a starting point of a potentially good work, but it is not ready to be published yet.
