## Abstract
Deep visual graph matching (GM) is a challenging task in combinatorial learning that involves finding a permutation matrix that indicates the correspondence between keypoints from a pair of images and their associated keypoint positions. 
Nevertheless, recent empirical studies have demonstrated that visual GM is susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can severely impair the matching quality and jeopardize the reliability of downstream applications.
To the best of our knowledge, certifying robustness for deep visual GM remains an open challenge, which entails addressing two main difficulties: how to handle the paired inputs and the large permutation output space, and how to balance the trade-off between certified robustness and matching performance. 

In this paper, we propose a method, Certified Robustness based on Optimal Smoothing Range Search (CR-OSRS), which provides a robustness guarantee for deep visual GM, inspired by the random smoothing technique. Unlike the conventional random smoothing methods that use isotropic Gaussian distributions, we build the smoothed model with a joint Gaussian distribution, which can capture the structural information between keypoints and mitigate the performance degradation caused by smoothing. We design a global optimization algorithm to search the optimal joint Gaussian distribution that helps achieve a larger certified space and higher matching performance. Considering the large permutation output space, we partition the output space based on similarity, which can reduce the computational complexity and certification difficulty arising from the diversity of the output matrix. Furthermore, we apply data augmentation and a similarity-based regularization term to enhance the smoothed model performance during the training phase. Since the certified space we obtain is high-dimensional and multivariable, it is challenging to evaluate directly and quantitatively, so we propose two methods (sampling and marginal radii) to measure it. Experimental results on GM datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art $\ell_{2}$ certified robustness. The source codes will be made publicly available.

### Summary
This paper proposes a certified robustness method of visual graph matching (GM) against adversarial perturbations on image pixels and keypoint positions. The method, named CR-OSRS, uses a joint Gaussian distribution to construct a smoothed model and searches for the optimal smoothing range that balances the trade-off between certified robustness and matching performance. The paper also introduces a data augmentation technique and a regularization term to improve the model performance during training. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of the proposed method on two GM datasets and four GM solvers.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a principled method that leverages the correlation between keypoints to construct a joint smoothing distribution and uses global optimization to find the optimal smoothing range.
- The paper provides rigorous theoretical analysis and proofs for the certified robustness guarantee, as well as two methods to quantify the certified space.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments on two GM datasets and four GM solvers, and demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over the baseline method.

### Weaknesses
- The paper lacks sufficient details regarding the implementation of the optimization algorithm for determining the optimal smoothing range, specifically the step 2 in Algorithm 1. Clarity is needed on the efficiency and scalability of this algorithm, especially in the context of larger-scale problems.
- The literature review on graph matching and its robustness omits references to recent works on noisy correspondence in graph matching [2], which is closely related to the issue of adversarial attacks.
- It is advisable to conduct a comparison between the proposed method and other existing techniques for robust GM, such as ASAR[1] and COMMON [2]. Specifically, COMMON addresses robust graph matching by considering noisy correspondence during training, while ASAR takes adversarial attacks into account during training. Evaluating these methods alongside CR-OSRS would provide more comprehensive experimental insights. Furthermore, reporting the certified accuracy and average certified radius for these models is encouraged.
- Since the author outlines four challenges in the Introduction, it would be beneficial to emphasize these points within the Method section, using C1 to C4.

### Questions
- Could you provide more details on the global optimization algorithm used to determine the optimal smoothing range? What is the computational complexity, and how scalable is this algorithm?
- The choice of baseline methods and datasets in your evaluation appears somewhat dated (prior to 2021). Would it be possible to include the recent and popular Spair-71k [3] graph matching dataset in your experiments to provide more up-to-date and comprehensive results?

The primary focus of the rebuttal should be on addressing the concerns mentioned in the "Weaknesses" section, particularly by providing further experiments involving different methods and a larger dataset.

### Summary
This work introduces a novel certified robustness algorithm for visual graph matching problem. To achieve a larger certified space as well as better trade-offs between certified robustness and matching performance, the authors propose to search the optimal joint Gaussian distribution for random smoothing with a subspace defined by a similarity threshold. The authors also provide theoretical analysis that the matching matrix can be bounded within the subspace. Extensive comparisons with various baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. The proposed algorithm is well motivated by the theoretical analysis.
3. The results are promising compared with other baselines.

### Weaknesses
My major concerns mainly lie in the ablation studies:

1. In Eq. 10, the authors mentioned that a constraint on b is imposed in the optimization. However, how this constraint works is not well explained. The effectiveness of this constraint is not evaluated in the experiments.
2. The authors introduced a regularization in Eq. 11, however, the ablation study of the variant without this regularization is missing.

### Questions
1. Please provide more details of the constraint in Eq. 10 as well as ablation studies.
2. Please provide the ablation study of the regularization in Eq. 11.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of robustness certification in visual graph matching, a problem lying between traditional regression models and combinatorial optimization. Two key technical innovations are introduced: using pairs of graph data as inputs and adding constraints to the output space. The authors propose an Optimal Smoothing Range Search approach, inspired by random smoothing techniques, to enhance robustness. Practical techniques such as output space partitioning based on similarity, data augmentation, and a similarity-based regularization term are also presented. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an intriguing and essential problem, as existing certification methods are primarily geared toward image recognition, leaving structured prediction, especially combinatorial optimization, less explored. While graph matching is a well-studied problem in recent machine learning literature, certification in this context has been notably absent.

2. The novel techniques, particularly the global optimization search algorithm, stand out as a reasonable and innovative approach, well-suited to the new problem setting examined in this paper.

3. The paper introduces two new methods for measuring the certified space, offering valuable tools for quantitative analysis.

4. The paper achieves a commendable balance between matching accuracy and robustness certification, as evidenced by extensive experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The presentation can be improved for better clarity, as it involves multiple areas ranging from graph matching (combinatorial optimization), robustness certification, visual recognition, etc.
2. the paper lacks some discussion for enlarging its potential impact to other combinatorial tasks or any limitation and difficulty to extend its adaption to other tasks.

### Questions
1. Have you explored the possibility of extending your approach to address problems beyond graph matching? Given the ubiquity of combinatorial optimization on graphs, a discussion on a potentially more general framework could be beneficial.

2. Can you add a table or figure to summarize and compare related methods from multiple aspects for better accessibility of readers?

### Summary
This paper focuses on certifying the robustness of deep visual graph matching and introduces a novel certification method, CR-OSRS. Initially, the method constructs a joint Gaussian distribution and employs a global optimization algorithm to find the optimal distribution. Additionally, during training, the authors enhance model performance through data augmentation with joint Gaussian noise and an output similarity-based regularization term. Finally, two methods, sampling and marginal radii, are proposed for measuring the certified space for quantitative analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that CR-OSRS offers robustness guarantees for visual GM, outperforming direct application of RS.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides detailed insights into the four challenges faced by RS and proposing corresponding solutions for each challenge.
2. The introduction of the novel certification method, CR-OSRS, is substantiated with thorough proofs. Moreover, the paper introduces two quantitative metrics, sampling and marginal radii, to measure certified robustness.
3. The experimental results validating the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation and similarity-based regularization are compelling.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 2 shows that, without employing data augmentation and similarity-based regularization, the performance of CR-OSRS is comparable to RS-GM.
2. Could acceleration be achieved by incorporating entropy regularization into the optimization process?
3. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide an analysis of the computational complexity of this method.
4. The author wants to express too much content in the article, resulting in insufficient details and incomplete content in the main text.
5. The experimental part needs to be reorganized and further improved.

Details comments
1) It is recommended to swap the positions of Sections 4.3 and 4.4. According to the diagram, 4.3 is the training section, and 4.4 aims to measure certified space. Both 4.1 and 4.2 belong to the robustness and testing sections. Therefore, putting these parts together feels more reasonable.
2) The author should emphasize "The article is a general and robust method that can be applied to various GM methods, and we only use NGMv2 as an example." at the beginning of the article, rather than just showing in the title of Method Figure 1. This can better highlight the characteristics and contribution of the method. 
3) The experimental part needs to be reorganized and further improved. The experimental section has a lot of content, but the experimental content listed in the main text does not highlight the superiority of the method well, so it needs to be reorganized. Based on the characteristics of the article, the experimental suggestions in the main text should include the following: 1. Robustness comparison and accuracy analysis with other empirical robustness algorithms for the same type of perturbations, rather than just focusing on the RS method, to clarify the superiority of the method. (You should supplement this part.) 2. Suggest using ablation experiments as the second part to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. 3. Parameter analysis, elucidating the method's dependence on parameters. 4. Consider its applications on six basic algorithms as an extension part. Afterwards, based on the importance, select the important ones to place in the main text, and show the rest in the appendix.
4) In P16, the proof of claim 2, it should be P(I \in B) not P(I \in A).
5) In Table 2 of appendix, the Summary of main existing literature in learning GM can list the related types of perturbations.
6) In Formula 8, please clarify the meaning of lower p (lower bound of unilateral confidence), and the reason and meaning of setting as 1/2.

### Questions
1. Can this paper conduct a comparative analysis with [1]?
2. The author proposes a universal robustness framework, and in the experimental part, except RS, other empirical robustness algorithms for the same type of perturbations should be compared to evaluate the advantages of this authentication robustness method.
3. Some details need to be rechecked and explained, as shown in the following.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel method named Certified Robustness based on Optimal Smoothing Range Search (CR-OSRS) to enhance robustness in deep visual graph matching, which is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This method employs a joint Gaussian distribution for random smoothing, improving structural keypoint matching and balancing robustness with performance. CR-OSRS uses global optimization and similarity-based output space partitioning to manage computational complexity and enhance performance. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experimental results.

### Strengths
-The paper proposes CR-OSRS, a method inspired by RS, to build a smoothed model with a joint Gaussian distribution specifically for visual GM application to capture the structural information between keypoints.

-The paper introduces a global optimization algorithm designed to find the optimal parameters for the joint Gaussian distribution, aimed at achieving a larger certified space.

-Applying data augmentation and a similarity-based regularization term during training helps improve the performance of the smoothed model.

### Weaknesses
-The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the base model and the smoothed model to support the claim of mitigating performance degradation due to smoothing.

-The improvement in CA is achieved not solely by CR-OSRS but largely through retraining the base model with data augmentation and a regularization term. These additional techniques contribute to the model reaching a similar level of CA at the same radius for RS-GM, too.

-It's unclear how CR-OSRS performs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, particularly those that may not follow the assumptions made in the method's design. E.g, inserting outliers. These outliers could be points that are randomly inserted, or strategically placed by an adversary which can significantly alter the structural information between keypoints.

-The experiments are conducted on a limited number of testing samples for the Pascal VOC and Spair71k datasets. And limited testing samples can affect the generalizability of the results and may not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness across diverse conditions.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel certification method addressing the Visual Graph Matching problem. The authors highlight various challenges associated with applying original randomized smoothing techniques to visual GM. To address these challenges, they design a smoothed model utilizing a joint Gaussian distribution to capture keypoint correlations. Additionally, they implement a similarity threshold to reduce the permutation count. Moreover, they introduce two methods, sampling and marginal radii, to gauge the certified space for paired robustness. The paper offers both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The authors tackle several challenges to achieve certified robustness for visual graph matching.

2. The derivation for the certified robustness appears to be sound.

3. The experimental results demonstrate a clear advantage in terms of robustness.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors focus on the certified robustness against attacks on keypoint positions in the main content. The investigation of the attacks on node/edge features is limited in this paper. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify this point.

2. One main contribution of this work is to use the joint Gaussian distribution to build a smoothed model. However, the authors do not clearly elaborate on why they designed $\Sigma$ in this manner. The authors should consider conducting a study on the impact of different construction choices of the joint Gaussian distribution.

3. The authors should compare with more smoothing methods, such as [1] and [2], to demonstrate the advantage of their algorithm.

4. The authors do not demonstrate the matching accuracy of the GM solvers without smoothing. Performance degradation caused by smoothing remains unknown. Therefore, it's hard to tell the significance of the performance improvement in this work, especially considering that the improvement shown in the current numerical results appears to be limited.

5. The presentation of experimental results is unclear, especially when compared with the RS-GM method. The authors could differentiate between different methods by using different line types or thicknesses.

6. In Fig.3(b), the improvement of robustness from s=0.9 to s=0.6 is limited. The authors could test more points between s=1.0 and s=0.9 to demonstrate the results more clearly.

### Questions
1. The current design appears strange to me as it seems that for two different nodes $u$ and $v$, the correlation $\Sigma(u,v)$ can be either 0 or $\sigma \cdot b$ depending on their order among all nodes. Is there any reason to design in this way?

2. Since it is no longer a classification problem, why is low bound of the probability in Eq.(7) to be 1/2?

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach to attain certifiable robustness for deep graph
matching (GM) against adversarial inputs. Existing approaches based on
randomized smoothing do not work for GM because of the large output
permutation space. The authors proposed an alternative method called
Certified Robustness based on Optimal Smoothing Range Search (CR-OSRS).
The main idea is to develop a new notion of robustness for permutation
outputs (based on similarity (5)) and to perturb the input keypoint
positions by a joint Gaussian distribution (instead of an isotropic
Gaussian distribution). Methods to choose the joint Gaussian
distribution and to measure the certified space are also developed.

### Strengths
1. Robustness of Deep GM is difficult due to the large output permuation
space. This work seems to be the first that aims to attain certifiable
robustness for Deep GM.

### Weaknesses
1. I wish the presentation of proposed method is more clear. Right now
both the new robustness notion and the proposed method lack clarity.

### Questions
1. The main result appears to be Theorem 4.1, which states that, for
perturbation $(\delta_1, \delta_2)$ of keypoint positions within (9),
the proposed method guarantees that $g_0(...+\delta1, +\delta2)=1$. However, what is the
significance of $g_0(...)=1$? At best, it states that, with another
random perturbation $(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2)$, the probability that the
output of $f$ is too far from the corresponding core output is higher
than 1/2.  However, it is unclear to me how this claim can connect to
the desirable robustness property, i.e., the output of the deep GM is
robust against the perturbation $(\delta_1, \delta_2)$. Without a clear
explanation of this connection, it is difficult for the reader to
understand the meaning and significance of Theorem 4.1. 

2. The construction of $B_1$ and $B_2$ in Section 4.2 also needs better
explanation. I understand that there are non-zero off-diagonal elements
$\sigma \times b$ right adjacent to the main diagonal.  While this does
create correlation between the perturbation of different keypoints, I am lost
why this is a good choice and what purpose it aims to serve. In
particular, these off-diagonal elements correspond to pairs of indices
$(i,i+1)$. However, with arbitrary indexing of the keypoints, $i$ and
$i+1$ may correspond to two keypoints that are far away. Thus, I don't
understand why adding correlation between such a pair of keypoints is a
good idea. 

Related to this point, equation (10), which is the objective for
optimizing $B_1$ and $B_2$, also needs more explanation. 

3. In Algorithm 2 on page 18 (for optimizing (10)), is Line 11 a
gradient step? How is the gradient calculated?
