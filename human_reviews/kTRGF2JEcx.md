# Instructing Large Language Models to Identify and Ignore Irrelevant Conditions

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
Math word problem (MWP) solving requires generating a reasoning path based on a given problem description that often contains irrelevant conditions. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods elicited multi-step reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to solve MWPs. However, they were seriously confused by the irrelevant conditions, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named I$^3$C that instructs LLMs to identify and ignore irrelevant conditions. It identifies a set of irrelevant condition candidates that have a weak semantic relevance with the question. Then it prompts LLMs to verify the irrelevant conditions. Lastly it instructs the LLMs with the verification on relevant and irrelevant conditions to avoid confusion and improve reasoning paths. Moreover, we propose to select (problem, reasoning paths)-pairs as demonstrations to enhance I$^3$C with few-shot reasoning. We develop I$^3$C-Select that selects the most confusing problems based on the semantic relevance measurement. We conduct extensive experiments on six MWP datasets. I$^3$C can be combined with any CoT prompting methods to improve the performance of solving MWPs. Notably, I$^3$C-Select achieves an accuracy of $93.7$ and $90.9$ on GSM-IC2-1K and GSM-ICM-1K, respectively, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art few-shot prompting method Auto-CoT by $+19.4$ and $+25.7$.

### Summary
For math word problems, many existing works use the naive or chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to generate outputs based on the given question and conditions. However, some conditions are irrelevant to solving the question, and, inspired by this, the authors propose to identify and ignore irrelevant conditions, by 1) firstly calculating similarities across conditions and between conditions and the question, and then 2) further prompting the LLM to determine whether conditions with low similarities are indeed irrelevant to solving the question. After that, the authors prompt the LLMs to ignore the identified irrelevant conditions. The authors validate their proposed method, namely I$^3$C, which is coupled with other prompting methods, and show that the proposed I$^3$C significantly increases their performance on multiple math word problem datasets.

### Strengths
* The proposed method to identify and ignore irrelevant conditions in math world problems is simple and easy to adopt but also very powerful.
* The proposed method can be easily coupled with existing prompting methods but also consistently improves their performance.

### Weaknesses
* The paper (Complexity-Based Prompting for Multi-Step Reasoning) discussed in Line 163 is a good baseline to compare. Similar to the idea of this work regarding I$^3$C-Select that aims to use complex examples as demonstrations, the discussed paper also aims to incorporate complex examples as demonstrations. 
* The effectiveness of the embedding similarity-based and the LLM-based methods for identifying irrelevant conditions should be analyzed more. The authors may conduct an ablation study on it (using either of them, for analyzing each module's contribution to filtering).
* The computational costs in using the proposed I$^3$C with existing prompting methods may be significantly increased, compared to using prompting methods only, since it further verifies the relevance of each candidate condition with LLMs, especially when the number of candidate conditions is large. Further, in Figure 2 which shows the efficiency of the proposed model against the self-consistency model, it may be more reasonable to include the efficiency of the prompting methods without the proposed I$^3$C and then compare them. 
* It is a bit unclear why including the examples, whose conditions are semantically very different from the question and other conditions, as the demonstrations of the prompt can improve the performance substantially. If the purpose is to incorporate examples with higher reasoning complexity as explained in Line 163, the authors may select or compare other strategies (e.g., using examples that the model fails to solve).

### Questions
* What is the ratio of the conditions identified as irrelevant (Lines 150-151)? I think it should be also reported in the paper. 
* The authors may include the results of the self-consistency model in their main tables (Tables 1 and 2). 
* In Table 2, why does the performance of the proposed I$^3$C significantly drop when combined with Auto-CoT on 3-step reasoning problems?
* I would like to suggest putting Tables and Figures according to the order they are mentioned in the text.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of instructing large language models to ignore irrelevant information when solving math world problems. This paper proposes an approach called I3C. The approach first finds irrelevant condition candidates using similarity scores (measured by SimCSE) between each condition and the question. And then use LLMs to get feedback on whether the candidates are irrelevant. Finally, the approach incorporates the feedback from LLMs to build an instruction and augments CoT prompting so as to better ignore irrelevant conditions. In addition to the I3C approach, authors also consider selecting confusing examples to construct prompts. The authors perform experiments on several math-word-problem datasets. Adding the I3C instruction improves CoT prompting methods on datasets containing irrelevant conditions.

### Strengths
The proposed approach that uses similarity to identify irrelevant conditions and uses LLMs to further verify is intuitive.

The paper presents experiments covering multiple datasets and base CoT prompting techniques. The results suggest the effectiveness of adding I3C instructions on top of base prompting techniques across multiple settings involving irrelevant conditions.

### Weaknesses
Overall I feel the paper is presented in a way that emphasizes the settings which favor the proposed approach a lot. 

---

1.The proposed approach requires extra time and computation overhead of verifying irrelevant conditions. I believe it would be useful to discuss this overhead, at least token overhead in more detail in the main experiments.

Currently, the paper provides a very brief analysis in Figure 2, comparing zeroCoT+I3c against ZeroCoT+Consistency. I believe more detailed analysis should be provided covering more datasets (especially, on GSM, see point 2) and more approaches (especially on Instruct-CoT, see point 3). In particular, based on Figure 2, it seems like the cost Zero-COT + I3C roughly equals to 5 self-consistent sampling. I think at least the comparison should be made between Instruct-COT + 5 sample SC and Instruct-CoT + I3C on GSM.

In a more principled way, it is good if all the comparisons can be provided on an equal-computation-basis, (e.g., providing the comparison between Instruct-CoT + consistency with Instruct-CoT+I3C in the main table)

---

2.The paper does not thoroughly discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a setting where there aren’t many distractors. The chosen datasets are limited in complexity and may favor the proposed approach.

In particular, most of the datasets contain synthetically injected irrelevant conditions (these are somewhat an adversarial setting). The only more natural dataset is GSM, which is also limited in complexity. I believe it would be useful to include experiments on more complex and more natural datasets like AQUA and MATH to investigate how the approach generalizes to more common settings.

---

3.The choice of baselines may inflate the gain. IIUC, many of the baselines can be upgraded to include the instructions from Shi et al., 2023.

---

4.The paper only considers CoT prompting and does not test on a wide range of executor-augmented prompting techniques like PAL (Gao et al., 2023). SatLM (Ye et al., 2023). These approaches show significant improvements over base CoT prompting techniques on math-world problems.

---

5.The paper mainly tests on text-davinci-003, it is unsure how it will generalize to more advanced models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, which could possibly be better at ignoring irrelevant conditions.

---

6.While the paper proposes I3C-select, it provides little comparison to other example-selection approaches like Complexity-CoT (Fu et al., 2022) and compositional examples (Ye et al., 2023).

### Summary
This issue was demonstrated previously by [1]: LLMs can get distracted by irrelevant conditions in math word problems (MWPs). They curated a dataset of MWPs with synthetically added irrelevant conditions.

The paper proposes an approach to make the prompts for MWP solving LLMs robust to irrelevant conditions. They propose 2 solutions: the I3C (Identify and Ignore Irrelevant Conditions) prompt and I3C-Select in-context demonstration selection.

I3C:
1. A SimCSE sentence similarity model is used to identify sentences in the context that are different from other sentences and the query in embedding space. They hypothesize that irrelevant conditions will have low cosine similarity with other sentences in the problem
2. Based on this filter, they use the LLM to verify that every flagged sentence is indeed irrelevant to the query. They do this with the prompt: *"Q. Is condition c relevant to the process of solving problem q?"*
3. The output from the verifier for every condition is concatenated to form a prompt *I*
4. Finally, the I3C prompt asks the LLM: *"I. Q: q. A: Let’s think step by step”.*

I3C-Select:
PAst work has demonstrated that selecting demonstrations for in-context learning has a significant impact on downstream performance. I3C-Select chooses the MWPs with the lowest average inter-sentence embedding similarity (most irrelevant conditions) as in-context demonstrations.

Results:
Over several MWP datasets including the synthetic datasets with added irrelevant information, I3C and I3C-Select show significant improvement over baselines.

### Strengths
1. The proposed I3C and I3C-Select condition (using average inter-sentence similarity with SimCSE) for identifying challenging demonstrations is simple and intuitive given the task of interest
    - The improved prompting shows consistent improvements over competitive baselines for LLM prompting (concerns regarding I3C-Select baselines raised later)
2. The I3C prompt demonstrates that "soft" filtering by describing irrelevant conditions in the prompt works better than hard filtering of irrelevant condition
3. The paper provides reasonable ablations and analysis to support their results (some concerns raised in later sections)
    - Experiments show the stability of results when using weaker LLMs
    - Analysis of the effect of the cosine matching hyperparameter and quality of SimCSE-based filtering
4. The paper is well-written with appropriate descriptions of datasets and baselines

### Weaknesses
1. I3C-Select not compared to in-context example selection baselines
    - Authors mention complexity-based prompting [1] as a motivation for I3C-Select. They demonstrate that I3C-Select leads to performance improvements over randomly chosen demonstrations. However, they do not compare against the suggested baseline approach in [1]. I feel that this is a necessary comparison to demonstrate the utility of I3C-Select over other example selection baselines
2. (I3C-Select - I3C) is not ablated
    - I3C-Select uses the I3C prompt (including the condition filtering) by default. (I3C-Select - I3C) would demonstrate the utility of I3C-Select as a standalone demonstration selection procedure. This would look like using (I3C-Select + CoT)
3. Unclear description of the efficiency analysis of I3C (more questions in the next section)

### Questions
1. Regarding the weaknesses raised above, can the authors clarify their stance on I3C-Select? Is I3C-Select to be considered an additional benefit from running the SimCSE-based filtering of I3C, OR is it meant to be a stand-alone procedure for selecting demonstrations?
2. Efficiency comparison: Does the run-time and token-cost analysis of I3C vs Self-consistency consider the cost of (1) running SimCSE for every new problem and (2) running the LLM as a verifier? Judging by Fig 4(b), a significant portion of the problem needs LLM verification for the most challenging datasets.
3. For Fig 4(b), what is the average number of verification calls per MWP made to the LLM (for theta=0.5)?

### Summary
The paper addresses an important bottleneck in the performance of LLMs on math word problems (MWPs): irrelevant conditions in problem statements that can confuse the model and lead to incorrect reasoning paths. The proposed solution, I3C, is a prompting method that involves the LLM self-identifying the potentially irrelevant conditions in the question. These irrelevant conditions are then used in the instruction to "caution" the model against using them in final calculations. Empirical results on multiple MWP datasets show that I3C strongly outperforms existing baselines.

### Strengths
- Relevance of the Problem: The paper tackles a critical issue in applying LLMs to MWPs.

- Empirical Support: The authors present strong empirical evidence to support their claims (pending some clarifications, as expanded in weaknesses).

### Weaknesses
- Incremental Contribution: The main contribution of this work is of limited novelty (showing that an instruction to ignore irrelevant details)

- Model Relevance: The model used (text-davinci-003) is in Legacy mode now and generally vastly underperforms the newer models. Experiments with the more recent (and significantly cheaper) gpt-3.5-turbo might be more compelling.

- Methodological Concern: The authors mention that to create I3C-Select, "it first calculates the confusion score of solved problems." Does this mean problems from the test set that have already been worked out are used? If so, this is a significant design flaw, as the baselines have access to a drastically smaller dataset.

- Presentation and Clarity: The writing and tense usage could be more consistent. For example, Figure 1 states, "LLMs were confused by irrelevant conditions in complex math word problems and gave wrong answers." Section 3.2 presents an elaborate setup for identifying potentially confusing conditions, but ultimately, the LLM is used to decide on relevance.
