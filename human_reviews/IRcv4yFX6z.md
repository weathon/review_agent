## Abstract
Large vision and language models learned directly through image-text associations often lack detailed visual substantiation, whereas image segmentation tasks are treated separately from recognition, supervisedly learned without interconnections.

Our key observation is that,  while an image can be recognized in multiple ways, each has a consistent part-and-whole visual organization.  Segmentation thus should be treated not as an end task to be mastered through supervised learning, but as an internal process that evolves with and supports the ultimate goal of recognition. 

We propose to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, 
{\it train} and {\it adapt} the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives.  We learn hierarchical segmentation {\it for free} alongside recognition,  automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition. 

Enhancing the Vision Transformer (ViT) with adaptive segment tokens and graph pooling, our model surpasses ViT in unsupervised part-whole discovery, semantic segmentation, image classification, and efficiency.  Notably, our model (trained on {\it unlabeled} 1M ImageNet images) outperforms SAM (trained on 11M images and 1 billion masks) by absolute 8\% in mIoU on PartImageNet object segmentation.

### Summary
This paper introduces CAST (Concurrently Adaptive Segmentation Tokens).
This builds on existing work where superpixels are used as tokens in a
vision transformer. The new contribution is that graph pooling is used to
adaptively cluster segments to create a hierarchy, allowing segmentation (and
classification) at a coarse and fine-grained level. 

SEEDS is used to define superpixels via over-segmentation. A CNN produces
initial features on the original pixel regular grid. The mean of CNN features
under a superpixel define the feature-token for that superpixel. Positional
encodings are created in a similar way.

Superpixels are used as leafs of a tree, which is adaptively defined by graph
pooling. This tree has L layers, and starting from the leafs, the next layer is
defined by first assuming that there are C coarser segments at the next level,
and then for each token the network predicts a probability for which coarser
segment each finer segment should be assigned to. The argmax of the probability
is the assignment. The number of coarser segments is defined adaptively via the
Farthest Point Sampling algorithm.


Results are reported on:

* PartImageNet, where CAST is compared to a baseline ViT and SAM-B, where is shows a significant performance improvement over the baseline in most cases and also with lower computational costs.

* DensePose Human part segmentation, and is comparable to the HSG baseline.

* Pascal VOC Segmentation - where CAST and ViT are trained on COCO. Ablation studies are
  done here. CAST outperforms the baseline in all reported cases.

* Pascal VOC classification - where CAST is compared to ViT and Swin using a linear probing evaluation.

### Strengths
The algorithm design is well motivated.  

The technique is tested against strong baselines, and shows benefits in both quality and computational metrics. 

Design choices are ablated.

Additional details and failure cases are given in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
The tone is a bit to strong and unscientific at times. Value judgements are
placed on things, instead of performing comparisons and reporting results. I
recommend rewording in certain areas:

> We assert that our design is the proper approach for true vision transformer, distinct from the text-inspired ViT.

There is no "proper" approach. You can assert it might be a more natural choice in some circumstances, but in the instance where superpixel segmentation fails, then this is very much not the correct approach.

> CAST not only discovers the hierarchy but also enhances flat semantic segmentation, indicating its superiority in learning dense representations compared to ViT.

Superiority is too strong. It might be ok, but given the overstated tone in the rest of the paper, I think: "indicating that it learns richer dense representations" might be a better wording. 

> Sec. 4.4. We conducted an ablation study on our design choices, confirming that CAST is better
than previous token pooling approaches for ViT (Marin et al., 2021; Sarfraz et al., 2019).

It's not confirmed. You made a measurement that contributed evidence towards
the idea. Confirming is something that someone who replicates your work will
do. I recommend changing the word "confirmed" to measured in most places.

### Questions
> The resulting input segment features are defined as Z0 = [Xclass; Xs] + Epos

I've seen people simply adding positional encodings to the token features directly rather than concatenating them as additional feature channels. I must have missed the work that introduced / ablated this decision. Is there a reference you can point me to on this?


> We initiate the next-level coarse regions by sampling centroids from segment tokens Zl−1 at level l − 1 and compute Pl based on token similarity, with C representing the sampled centroid indices.

Are these centroids in position space or feature space?


> All models are self-supervisedly trained on IN-100 and evaluated using linear probing.

Is there a reference for this? I'm not familiar with this and it seems like a traditional imagenet-style classification benchmark would be a better comparison where there was a defined groundtruth.

### Summary
This work addresses image classification and hierarchical image segmentation. No pixel-wise ground truth is provided in training for segmentation, so the proposed ViT-based approach, CAST, is trained by self-supervision and supervised image classification. CAST replaces the fix-grid patches with superpixels, and uses a graph pooling to aggregate features to sampled cluster centroids. The resulting graph-pooled superpixel tokens are aimed at better incorporating the local-global hierarchical semantics, and can produce image segmentation. CAST is evaluated on multiple datasets, and outperforms SOTA.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written and easy to follow. The experiments are comprehensive, and the reported results are promising.

The motivation for using the superpixel token to replace the fixed-grid patch token in ViT is clear and interesting. As the initial superpixels are estimated based on low-level visual cues, the graph-pooled superpixel tokens incorporate appearance and shape details, as well as local-global hierarchical relationships. This seems to help give sharper segmentation masks than in related work.

### Weaknesses
Overall novelty seems limited. The proposed graph-pooling for aggregating fine-level tokens into coarse-level tokens is similar to the Multi-stage Token Aggregation in TCFormer (Zeng et al 2022) and the Token Merging in ToMe (Bolya et al 2023). A comparison of CAST with these two methods is missing.

The method increases complexity relative to using the fixed-grid of patches, since it requires estimation of superpixels and sampling the clusters. Performance seems to be critically dependent on the quality of superpixels and the cluster sampling methods. The paper poorly tests performance wrt varying quality of superpixels and cluster sampling. It is unsatisfying that these two components are not learnable, and that they are not end-to-end integrated with the rest of CAST.

### Questions
What is the "MLP ratio" in section 4.4 and Table 6.c? Above equation 3, it shows f(a,b) = a + MLP(b), but there is no coefficient there.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel method that adopts superpixel as the token for vision transformer. The superpixel tokens are hierarchically grouped together in each layer via graph pooling. This gives rise to a hierarchical segmentation result  using only image classification label. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- Using superpixel tokens is more appropriate for vision transformers. The proposed method delivers a hierarchical segmentation result using only image-level annotation.  I really appreciate the concept of using hierarchical segmentations as the tokens in different layers. In particular, the proposed method starts with a finest segmentation given by superpixels, and learns automatically the hierarchical segmentation. In my opinion, using different regions in hierarchical segmentation is a more natural and powerful way of image tokenization. 
- The experimental results are quite convincing. The generated hierarchical segmentation is visually impressive. As depicted in Table 1 and 3, the proposed method significantly outperforms some baseline methods (e.g., the powerful segment anything model), while being also efficient.

### Weaknesses
- The runtime analysis is missing. Compared with the vanilla ViT, the proposed method involves superpixel generation and graph pooling. Does this require much more extra runtime?
- Ablation study of using different superpixel methods. Is this proposed method sensitive to the finest segmentation ?

### Questions
Does this require much more extra runtime compared with classical ViT.
Is this proposed method sensitive to the finest segmentation ?

### Summary
This paper presents CAST - a variant of ViTs that does hierarchical segmentation of inputs and tokens as part of its pipeline. The method is simple - input pixels are partitioned into super-pixels (in contrast to simple patches for ViTs) a convolutional network is applied over the input image and the resulting features are pooled across the superpixels (average pooling) to create the initial set of tokens. 
From here the method works by passing the set of tokens through ViT blocks and between them graph pooling layers which group tokens into a coarser set of tokens by sampling centroids and measuring similarity between tokens and centroids. 

The method is trained with a self supervised objective (MoCo, read out from the last layer) and demonstrated to work well in a variety of contexts.

### Strengths
I think this is an interesting paper with good motivation and a simple and effective implementation of core ideas.

* While simple, the use of super pixels and feature pooling to replace the awkward patch based embeddings of ViTs is a nice and original idea.
* The method is quite elegant and naturally lends itself to several use cases which are demonstrated in the paper in a convincing manner (mostly)
* Paper is well presented and well executed and was quite easy to follow.
* A highly applicable method which should be easy to use in several contexts so significant to the community.

### Weaknesses
I have some (relatively minor) concerns about parts of this work:

* The major thing which I find missing is more in-depth discussion of the role of super-pixels here - I feel the ablation table is missing one critical row which is a ViT with a super-pixel (+conv net) embedding layer instead of patch extraction. This is also a possible explanation to the results in Table 5. There is a chance that super-pixels are the source of most of the improvements in the paper (quantitatively, at least, clearly there would be no clear hierarchical structure in this case) and this is not discussed enough.

* The positional embedding pooling is a bit odd - super pixels can be with quite arbitrary shapes and there is a chance the resulting average PE over the super pixels would bare little connection to the actual "position" of the super pixel. Can the authors comment on that?

* While the authors claim there's a top-down element here (and arguably there is through training) I would argue it is not truly top-down at inference. The super pixels and segmentations do not depend and will not change based on what the top layers infer - the network has top-down pathway to inform them (other than gradients in training). This is of course fine, but it should be discussed.

I hope to see a discussion about the points above and I would be happy to raise my score if these are discussed and addressed to.

### Questions
More minor questions:

* How do segmentations are extracted from ViTs in the paper? it's not clear to me how the results in, say, Figure 4, were generated for ViT-S.

* Is the PE added to the CLS token as well?
