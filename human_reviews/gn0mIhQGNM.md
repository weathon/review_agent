- Decision: Accept (spotlight)

## Abstract
With evolving data regulations, machine unlearning (MU) has become an important tool for fostering trust and safety in today's AI models. However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often suffer limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' for MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting data points). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach that can effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation tasks. As highlighted below, For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Saliency.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a method called Saliency Unlearning (SalUn) that aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MU in both image classification and generation tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-structured and self-contained.
2. The experiments are thorough, comparing SalUn with multiple baselines in different scenarios.
3. The paper broadly investigates previous methods, discusses their limitations, and proposes a versatile method to alleviate them.

### Weaknesses
1. The quality of many generated images is bad. 
2. The unlearning of the generation task is only conducted with one version of the Latent Diffusion Model. Considering that many personalized models trained with Dreambooth or more powerful models like SDXL, DALLE, and Imagen are available, they should be further tested to verify their universal effectiveness. Also, the generation of images should be repeated with different seeds to avoid cherry-picking.

### Questions
I have to say, although relevant, I have limited knowledge about machine unlearning, and I will consider the opinions of other reviewers to make further decisions.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach called "Saliency Unlearning" (SalUn) in the context of machine unlearning (MU) to improve the accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability of unlearning data from AI models. SalUn focuses on specific model weights, similar to input saliency in model explanation, and effectively erases the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation. SalUn outperforms existing methods and achieves high unlearning accuracy, even in challenging scenarios like random data forgetting and harmful image prevention.

### Strengths
- Machine unlearning is critical, especially now that large models trained on the whole internet are available to everyone
- The proposed method is simple, intuitive, and extremely effective according to the experiments in the paper
- Image generation is a great benchmark for these models, kudos to the authors for including experiments with diffusion models
- The paper is well written, and the figures are intuitive. The whole thing feels polished and appropriate for the venue.

### Weaknesses
- It would have been better to disregard classification experiments and have language generation experiments instead. This would also elucidate possible challenges when trying to unlearn sequential knowledge where the classification of each slot (token) depends on previous tokens as well. This might impact the proposed method, since it is harder to pinpoint the weights that caused the unwanted behavior. Also, the random labeling approach for estimating saliency would also be suboptimal, because many tokens like articles and prepositions might be used in harmful as well as harmless sentences.
- Experiments with zero-shot classification (CLIP) would have also been preferable wrt pure classification
- There are many methods for weight saliency estimation, it would have been nice if the authors had ablated this component using different estimation methods. See continual learning literature.
- Limitations of the proposed method should also be addressed

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel concept of 'saliency unlearning' (SalUn) to address the challenges of machine unlearning (MU) in the context of data protection and trustworthy machine learning. The paper critiques the instability and adaptability issues of current MU methods and proposes a weight saliency-based approach to enhance MU performance in both image classification and generation tasks. The authors provide experimental comparisons with existing MU methods, demonstrating SalUn's effectiveness, especially in preventing harmful content generation in diffusion models. The paper is well-structured, with comprehensive experiments validating the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ SalUn introduces a novel gradient-based weight saliency approach, a significant departure from existing MU methods.
+ Demonstrates SalUn's practical utility in preventing the generation of harmful content, an important aspect for the deployment of generative models.

### Weaknesses
- The authors could enhance the paper by providing a more thorough analysis of the potential limitations or scenarios where the SalUn method may not perform optimally.

### Questions
1. Can the authors elaborate on how SalUn would handle incremental unlearning scenarios where data points are continuously added and removed?
2. What are the computational costs associated with SalUn compared to traditional retraining methods, especially for very large datasets?
3. Include a discussion on the potential limitations of SalUn, such as scenarios where it may fail or be less effective, to provide a balanced view.

### Summary
Inspired by modular ML approaches such as weight sparsity, this work introduces a Machine Unlearning (MU) approach for image classification and generation that creates weight saliency maps to identify weights that need to be unlearned and weights to keep unchanged. The map coefficients are set to 1 when the magnitude of gradient of the forgetting loss is higher than a threshold (set heuristically to the median of the gradient of the forgetting loss). A first assessment of classical MU approaches on CIFAR10 motivates the need for a better approach, then the experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach SAGUN on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, ImageNette using 4 relevant metrics for machine unlearning. Authors also provide quantitative and qualitative evaluation of their approach applied to reduce the number of nudity image generation, showing large improvements over the previous works on generative machine unlearning ESD and FMN.

### Strengths
* Clearly written and motivated work.
* Significance: the task is very relevant: machine unlearning for generative models, a very important topic to prevent harmful content generation, was lacking an effective solution. 
* The approach is simple, effective, modular, and original to my knowledge. 
* The experimental section presents extensive results, qualitative and quantitative.

### Weaknesses
* The main table of numerical results is on CIFAR10, with close to 100% RA accuracy, so makes it difficult to compare approaches results. The gap with concurrent approaches reduces a bit on CIFAR100. It would be interesting to see a comparison on a dataset with larger images to make sure the approach scales effectively.  
* Some choices lack justifications, for instance, in the motivation figure, IU is picked as an example, and in the approach section, the forgetting loss is using the Gradient Ascent (GA) one. We see later that Table A1 presents results with the combination of different approaches.
* There are not many parameters to tune, but I did not see an ablation on the choice of alpha in (7). What are the results with alpha =0? How was the number of steps chosen in the different cases?
* No code available.

### Questions
For my main concerns, see the Weakness section.

Specific asks for Fig 6: 
a) given the small size of the figure, one of the image is looking like a nudity example, it is only with a high zoom that one can see the person is not actually naked. I would suggest to also mask this image (P6, ESD).
b) I would suggest blurring the faces of identifiable persons here as it does not bring anything more to the scientific content of the paper.
Similarly, in the text, I don't think giving an example of a nudity prompt is necessary. 

Minor comments: 
 
* The approaches behind the two generative unlearning previous works could be discussed a bit more in the related work section.
* Maybe consider citing the Gradient surgery paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04550.pdf in the related work section. 

* Remove the "as we can see" (multiple occurrences) to save space
* Maybe revise sentence "existing MU methods tend to either over-forget, resulting in poor generation quality ... (e.g. GA, RL) or under-forget: I don't see the causality link here, with very similar results of the GA and RL for both sets of classes. 
* Page 8 : "which contradicts the results obtained by retrain.." -> I did not understand why it did contradict the Retrain results, maybe add a little detail here.
