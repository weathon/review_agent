## Abstract
We aim at exploiting additional auxiliary labels from an independent (auxiliary) task to boost the primary task performance which we focus on, while preserving a single task inference cost of the primary task. While most existing auxiliary learning methods are optimization-based relying on loss weights/gradients manipulation, our method is architecture-based with a flexible asymmetric structure for the primary and auxiliary tasks, which produces different networks for training and inference. Specifically, starting from two single task networks/branches (each representing a task), we propose a novel method with evolving networks where only primary-to-auxiliary links exist as the cross-task connections after convergence. These connections can be removed during the primary task inference, resulting in a single-task inference cost. We achieve this by formulating a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) problem, where we initialize bi-directional connections in the search space and guide the NAS optimization converging to an architecture with only the single-side primary-to-auxiliary connections. Moreover, our method can be incorporated with optimization-based auxiliary learning approaches. Extensive experiments with six tasks on NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy datasets using VGG, ResNet, and ViT backbones validate the promising performance. The codes are available at https://github.com/ethanygao/Aux-NAS.

### Summary
This paper aims to harness the auxiliary tasks to enhance the performance of the primary task, while maintaining a single task inference cost for the primary task. The authors achieve this by designing an asymmetric network and further develops two algorithms: the first algorithm directly uses the asymmetric primary-to-auxiliary architecture, where the auxiliary tasks can be directly removed during the inference; the second algorithm initiates with an architecture with bi-directional connections, and subsequently exploits a tailored L1 constrained NAS optimization to prune all the auxiliary-to-primary connections, thereby enabling to remove the auxiliary task during inference. The proposed soft-parameter sharing architecture-based method can be integrate with existing optimization-based methods. The author validates their method with extensive experiments on 6 tasks with 3 CNN and transformer architectures.

### Strengths
1. This paper formulates the auxiliary learning problem through a task-oriented adaptive feature fusion approach without the need of explicitly identifying the task similarity. Mathematically, such architecture-based method can be seamlessly integrated with a variety of multi-task/auxiliary optimization methods such as loss re-weighting and gradient manipulation. The paper is well written and easy to understand, with an extensive literature review in Table 1 clearly demonstrating the contribution of the proposed method.
2. The evolving and asymmetric network design, coupled with a tailored NAS algorithm, ensures the converged network comprises only the primary-to-auxiliary connections, thereby guaranteeing a single-task inference cost for the learned architecture.
3. Beyond the benefits in the single-task inference cost, the authors also show (in Sect. 4.2.4 and the supplementary) that the training complexity exhibits a linear scalability to multiple auxiliary tasks.
4. The experiments are extensively performed on 6 highly diverse tasks with 3 base net architectures including CNN and transformers. The authors also checked the performance when the primary and the auxiliary tasks possess different architectures in the supplementary. The results of all those experiments are promising.

### Weaknesses
1. Is it possible to use Normalization and Activation operations other than BatchNorm and ReLU in Eqs. 13 and 14?
2. In Fig. 3, should the cut-off dash line be between the 1x1 conv and the add operations?
3. I suggest the authors to move the supplementary material into the Appendix of the main text for better readability.

### Summary
This paper introduces a learnable and flexible asymmetric network architecture designed for general-purpose auxiliary learning, where the auxiliary task plays a pivotal role in supporting the primary task's training process, and can be freely removed during the inference. As a result, the proposed method achieves a multi-task level performance while keeping a single-tasks level inference cost. The authors implement their design as adaptive layerwise feature fusion of multiple single-task branches, where the full network converges to an asymmetric architecture with only primary-to-auxiliary connections existed, enabling the removal of the auxiliary task during the inference. Two algorithms are developed to achieve this, where the more advanced one exploits a specifically designed NAS pruning to achieve an asymmetric architecture after convergence. The experiments are extensive across 6 tasks with 3 network backbone architectures, which sufficiently demonstrate the promising performance.

### Strengths
1.	This paper tackles the general-purpose auxiliary learning towards a multi-task level performance and a single-tasks level inference cost. The proposed method can be applied to various tasks and network backbones mathematically and also validated experimentally.
2.	The proposed method can also be freely combined with various multi-task or auxiliary task optimization methods listed in Table 1, which was also validated by the experiments.
3.	The single-task level inference cost is assured through the resultant converged asymmetric network architecture. Furthermore, the training cost exhibits a linear increase when incorporating additional auxiliary tasks, which is enabled by the supernet architecture for NAS that only encompasses the connections between the primary task and each of auxiliary tasks. 
4.	Table 1 present a very clear and comprehensive taxonomy about the position of the proposed method among the area of multi-task learning and the auxiliary task learning.
5.	The experiments are extensive, validating the generalization on 6 diverse tasks within 3 datasets, and 3 network backbones including both CNNs and Transformers.

### Weaknesses
This paper is well written, and I do not see major weakness, but the clarification of the following minor issues would further improve the paper: 
1.	I appreciate that the authors provide the full NAS objective in Eq. 10, but the details about how it is optimized need to be further elaborated. If I understand correctly, the model weight w and the architecture weight alpha should be updated iteratively?
2.	I suggest indicating the network backbone in the legends of Tables 3 and 4, as there are several tables in a similar shape that only differ from backbones.
3.	It is suggested to replace the figures with vector images for a better resolution. The paper, in its current version, used a lot of v-spacing; it is also advised to remove them for better readability.

### Questions
The author claimed that they implement the tailored version of PCGrad and AdaShare specifically for the auxiliary task learning, i.e., PCGrad-Aux and AdaShare-Aux. What are the details of those auxiliary task learning variants?

### Summary
The paper introduces a new framework for auxiliary learning, in which the goal is to improve the performance on a task of interest (i.e., primary task) by utilizing auxiliary information. In particular, the proposed method aims to tackle auxiliary learning problems without introducing computational or parameter overhead during inference. To this end, the paper borrows inspiration from multi-task learning and neural architecture search to design an asymmetric network architectures, where the connections from primary-task network layers and auxiliary-task network-layers are directed (from primary to auxiliary), such that computations or parts of networks for auxiliary information can be removed during inference.

### Strengths
- The proposed method successfully tackles auxiliary learning without inducing extra computational overhead during inference, by utilizing NAS to design a network that has asymmetric connections directed from primary-task network parts to auxiliary-task network parts.

- The proposed method is flexible in that it can be combined with different auxiliary learning methods

- The paper is clearly written; easy to read and follow.

### Weaknesses
- Is there a need to initialize search space to include all bi-directional connections? why not start from networks with only primary-to-auxiliary connections right away?

- Lack of ablation studies related with the question above: the performance change as the search space only contains primary-to-auxiliary connections.

- Missing details: Are all auxiliary-to-primary connections are pruned at the end of training?

- Missing details: What is the final architecture produced by NAS? How consistent is the final performance across different random seeds and trials?

### Summary
This paper presents an architecture based take on auxiliary learning. They recognize that the asymmetry between the auxiliary and primary tasks can be exploited by learning architectures with constraints that favor transfer of information from the auxiliary to the primary, but in an indirect way so as to minimize the possibility / effect of negative transfer.

### Strengths
1. The idea is novel and interesting.  I think the use of joint training, followed by the slow trimming of the aux-to-prim connections via L1 regularization is a clever way of more intimately introducing the auxiliary task  but remove it later to avoid needing it during inference.
2. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow
3. This has interesting implications for Auxiliary learning based architecture search -- since what was searched for in this paper were connections, there are expansions on this that can focus on other parts of the architecture space.

### Weaknesses
1. Method might be a bit too complex / cumbersome to be practically implemented widely -- especially given the size of the gains.
2. Method also significantly increases memory / compute overhead at training time
3. The experimental results have no error-bars. It's thus hard to judge the significance of the results

### Nitpicks
1. The introduction has *a lot* of italicized text, many of which I think are unnecessary and distracting.

### Summary
The paper studies how to harness additional auxiliary labels from an auxiliary task to elevate the performance of the main task without escalating the inference cost. To do so, the authors propose to employ individual networks for different tasks and only regularize the main task with the auxiliary task’s gradient. It’s understandable that this act allows the network trained on the auxiliary task to be completely pruned during inference. Furthermore, the authors propose to search for the most appropriate structure that satisfies the previously mentioned constraint with NAS. The paper accentuates its methodology's compatibility with prevailing optimization-based auxiliary learning techniques. The empirical validation, evident from experiments on NYU v2, CityScapes, and Taskonomy datasets using well-known backbones like VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B, demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Strengths
++ The paper is well-written with clearly motivated arguments and insights. The auxiliary learning task is also meaningful when we only seek to boost one task with another and aim at quick inference. 

++ Table 1 provides a comprehensive understanding and meticulous survey of the field. The authors offer an exhaustive overview of both Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and Auxiliary Learning (AL) methods. Authors have incorporated a wide range of references from multiple years, indicating a holistic survey of both seminal works and recent advancements. The inclusion of their method alongside existing techniques also provides clarity on its positioning within the broader research landscape. 

++ The proposed method is backbone- and task-agnostic that is applicable to multiple backbones and tasks.

### Weaknesses
-- I am not very familiar with auxiliary learning. However, I do think one baseline might be meaningful, which is to share a single backbone while projecting the gradient of the auxiliary task to the orthogonal direction of the main task on all (or selective) layers. This baseline also has no inference lag while exploiting the auxiliary objective signals. 

-- The authors use NAS to search for suitable architectures to optimize the main task's objective. However, distinct backbones are used for each task, and their weights can vary significantly. I'm uncertain why "stitching" two backbones with different weights and objectives is logical. Are there any supporting theories or references?

-- The authors claim that their method achieves "promising performance." However, based on Tables 3 and 4, it appears that the performance gain of the proposed method is only marginal. Considering the additional training costs in the NAS search and optimization, I am not sure whether the loss in training efficiency is worth it.
