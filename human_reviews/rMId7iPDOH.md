# Stylist: Style-Driven Feature Ranking for Robust Novelty Detection

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Novelty detection aims at finding samples that differ in some form from the distribution of seen samples. But not all changes are created equal. Data can suffer a multitude of distribution shifts, and we might want to detect only some types of relevant changes. Similar to works in out-of-distribution generalization, we propose to use the formalization of separating into semantic or content changes, that are relevant to our task, and style changes, that are irrelevant. Within this formalization, we define the robust novelty detection as the task of finding semantic changes while being robust to style distributional shifts. Leveraging pretrained, large-scale model representations, we introduce Stylist, a novel method that focuses on dropping environment-biased features. First, we compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution distances between environments. Next, we show that our selection manages to remove features responsible for spurious correlations and improve novelty detection performance. For evaluation, we adapt domain generalization datasets to our task and analyze the methods' behaviors. We additionally built a large synthetic dataset where we have control over the spurious correlations degree. We prove that our selection mechanism improves novelty detection algorithms across multiple datasets, containing both stylistic and content shifts.

### Summary
Novelty detection is a nuanced problem, as one cannot distinguish between novel styles to be generalized and novel contents to be filtered. To distinguish these two cases, this paper considers a multi-environment setup in which the user is aware of multiple datasets with the same content but different styles. Given a pre-trained backbone, the paper introduces a feature selection method called Stylist, which selects the more env-invariant features by computing perturbations across environments. By focusing solely on the env-invariant features, Stylist improves upon previous feature-based novelty detection methods.

### Strengths
Distinguishing novel styles and contents is an important problem in the literature on uncertainty and robustness. Prior works have mostly focused on a single task, either generalizing to novel styles (i.e., domain generalization) or filtering novel contents (i.e., novelty detection). Bridging the gap between both fields is an important research direction.

### Weaknesses
**Limited scope**

The paper addresses a minor tweak of an existing problem. In doing so, it proposes an intuitive method that can be integrated with existing techniques, resulting in a clear improvement over the baseline.
While tackling a niche problem can be an easy way to write a paper, I believe that in representative venues like ICLR, the focus should be on addressing the core of the problem rather than opting for low-hanging fruit.

The authors could explore more impactful problems. For example, a single scalar uncertainty metric fails to differentiate between novel styles and contents. The proposed Stylist can be viewed as introducing a two-dimensional uncertainty to address this limitation.
Building on this concept, the authors might consider developing a unified framework that addresses both domain generalization and novelty detection in real-world situations.

**Comparison with invariant learning**

The paper aims to select domain-invariant features in a post-hoc manner. However, features can also be trained to be invariant using methods such as IRM.
A comparison between the proposed post-hoc feature selection and invariant learning is necessary, considering both domain generalization (tables in IRM) and novelty detection (tables in this paper).

---
**CLIP should be the default backbone choice**

In the methods section, the paper states, "our approach leverages pretrained embeddings with extensive coverage across various content and style categories."
However, the paper uses ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet for the main results, which does not align with the statement.

The paper should primarily consider models like CLIP, which are trained on diverse datasets and known to be robust to domain shifts.
The paper presents the CLIP results in Table 2, and the performance gap is significantly lower than that of the (domain-variant) ResNet.
Thus, the overall benefits of the proposed method may be exaggerated, and it would be more appropriate to conduct the main results using the less domain-variant models like CLIP.

---
**Hyperparameter selection**

The OOD detection competitors considered in the paper apply simple methods, such as OCSVM or kNN, on top of a fixed representation.
Given that this paper refines the representation, it is unsurprising that the proposed method enhances the original representation when appropriate hyperparameters are selected.

Furthermore, how were the hyperparameters selected? It seems they were chosen for optimal performance in the reported table.
However, (1) hyperparameters should not be spoiled by the test cases, and (2) the OOD detection method should be robust to unseen samples.
The correct approach is to select hyperparameters in a validation domain and evaluate their performance on novel test domains.

---
**Dataset contribution is marginal**

(1) The necessity of COCOShift95 over prior works is unclear.\
The paper introduces a new benchmark called COCOShift95, where objects are cut and shifted to different backgrounds.
Consequently, this benchmark is artificial and does not demand substantial effort, unlike previous works such as fMoW and DomainNet, which require considerable effort to collect realistic images.
What new insights can be gained from COCOShift95, aside from adding yet another column to the table?

(2) The cut and paste strategy has been considered in prior works.\
The approach of creating an artificial dataset through cut and paste has been proposed in previous works, such as Waterbirds and Background Challenge.
Additionally, why not use more natural benchmarks, such as MetaShift, which also include multi-domain images from COCO?
Therefore, the technical contribution of the proposed dataset collection strategy is also not convincing.

---
**Nitpicks**

- "+0.0" should not be highlighted in green in Table 3. It exaggerates the benefit of the proposed method.
- "Stylist" seems to be too ambiguous as a name for the feature selection method in multi-domain novelty detection.

### Questions
1. Why posthoc feature selection instead of using an invariant backbone like IRM or CLIP?
2. Were the hyperparameters chosen from the val set? Are they generalizable to unseen domains?

### Summary
This paper considers a robust novelty detection problem of finding semantic changes while being robust to style distributional shifts. The authors propose a feature selection method, which ranks the features by evaluating the differences of features across domains to achieve invariance, thereby removing the influence of spurious correlations. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposal is validated where the feature selection improves the subsequent novel detection algorithms under distribution shift.

### Strengths
1. The problem presented is important and highly relevant to the machine learning community. The proposal is straightforward and technologically feasible. 
2. The proposed feature selection can be combined with different novel detection algorithms and improve their robustness when facing distribution shifts. The authors also demonstrate that the proposal can effectively select environment-invariant features.
3. The overall presentation is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
Important references are missing. There have been some works on how to achieve novelty detection in the case of domain shift, which is the same as this paper. For example:
1. Open domain generalization with domain-augmented meta-learning. CVPR 2021
2. Open-set learning under covariate shift. ML 2022
3. Open-Set Single Domain Generalization. ICLR 2022  
These works all consider open-set learning/novelty detection under distribution shift. Moreover, the ML'22 and ICLR’22 works could improve cross-domain generalization without the requirement of multiple domains.  

The previous works mainly focus on improving model robustness from the perspective of representation learning, while the current work assumes that the representation has already been well learned and mainly focuses on feature selection. 

How does the author consider the sufficiency of representation capacity? Can we assume that the representation has been sufficiently learned after thorough across-domain representation learning? Will it still learn spurious correlations? Comparison with these works, especially the specific clarification of the applicable scope for this work, will further improve this manuscript.

### Questions
1. Differences with existing work and the rationale behind the assumptions made in the current work. [See weakness part]
2. In practice, how to determine the proportion of selected features? As shown in Figure 3. An inappropriate number of selected features can lead to a drop in ROC-AUC.

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of detecting novel environments in machine learning models, which is important for ensuring their robustness and reliability. The authors note that existing methods for novelty detection often rely on the assumption that the training and testing data come from the same distribution, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. They also point out that previous work has focused on either semantic or style changes, but not both, and that there is a need for a method that can separate these two types of changes and detect novel environments based on semantic changes while ignoring style changes.

To address this problem, the authors propose a novel method called Stylist, which leverages pretrained embeddings to separate semantic and style changes and rank features based on their relevance for detecting novel environments. The authors note that their approach is different from previous work in that it focuses on feature ranking rather than domain adaptation or anomaly detection. They also highlight the importance of identifying environment-biased features that contain spurious correlations and should be ignored for novelty detection.

The authors' contributions include a formalization of the problem of detecting novel environments based on semantic and style changes, a feature ranking approach that focuses on dropping environment-biased features, and an evaluation of their method on several benchmark datasets. They also provide insights into the impact of pretrained feature extractors and the potential applications of their method beyond novelty detection.

### Strengths
1. One of the strengths of Stylist is its ability to identify environment-biased features that contain spurious correlations and should be ignored for novelty detection. This is an important contribution, as spurious correlations can lead to false positives and negatively impact the reliability of machine learning models. By removing these features, Stylist can improve the generalization performance of novelty detection algorithms and make them more robust to changes in the environment.

2. Another strength of Stylist is its potential for interpretability. By ranking features based on their relevance for detecting novel environments, Stylist can provide insights into which features are important for the task at hand and which ones are not. This can be useful for understanding the behavior of machine learning models and for identifying areas for improvement.

### Weaknesses
1.  While the authors' approach of leveraging pretrained embeddings to separate semantic and style changes is innovative, the overall contribution of the paper may not be novel enough to warrant publication in a top-tier conference or journal. The authors could strengthen their contribution by providing more evidence of the novelty of their approach and by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods for novelty detection.

2.  While the authors have provided some results on synthetic and real-world datasets, the evaluation of their method could be more comprehensive. Specifically, the authors could provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the number of trials, to ensure that their results are reproducible. Additionally, the authors could compare their method with other state-of-the-art methods for novelty detection to better understand its strengths and weaknesses.

3. The paper focuses on the problem of detecting novel environments based on semantic and style changes, but it does not address other important aspects of novelty detection, such as temporal changes or changes in the data distribution over time. The authors could expand the scope of their work to address these other aspects of novelty detection and provide a more comprehensive solution to the problem.

### Questions
1. The authors mention that their method focuses on feature ranking rather than domain adaptation or anomaly detection, but it is not clear how this approach is fundamentally different from other methods. Could the authors provide more details on how their method differs from existing methods and what makes it unique?

2. The authors could provide more details on the experimental setup, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the number of trials, to ensure that their results are reproducible. Additionally, the authors could compare their method with other state-of-the-art methods for novelty detection to better understand its strengths and weaknesses. Could the authors provide more details on the experimental setup and the comparison with other methods?

### Summary
This paper focuses on novelty detection studies. Specifically, the authors want to improve the robustness of the novelty detection method to the spurious relations. To this end, the authors a new feature selection method called Stylist. The method ranks features according to the distance between different environments and selects features according to the rank.

### Strengths
1) The idea is technically sound. The proposal first rank features according to their distance between environments and remove features responsible for spurious correlations to improve the robustness.

### Weaknesses
1) It is not clear how to compute the Eq.(1) and Eq.(2). For example, how to construct different environments? How to split the features extracted from a pre-trained model into $N$ dimensions? It seems that if the pre-trained feature is very large, the computational cost is expensive.
2) In the experiments, the authors simply compare the proposal with the feature selection method and novelty detection method. However, there are some algorithms related to spurious relations that can be easily adapted to solve the novelty detection problem. Moreover, the adopted novelty detection methods are not SOTA. So, the experiment results are not convincing. More related methods should be discussed.
3) In my view, the spurious problems can be easily addressed with data augmentation. So I think maybe there exist easier methods to solve the problem in this paper.

### Questions
