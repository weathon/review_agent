# PolyFormer: Scalable Graph Transformer via Polynomial Attention

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Graph Transformers have demonstrated superior performance in graph representation learning. However, many current methods focus on attention mechanisms between node pairs, limiting their scalability and expressiveness on node-level tasks. While the recent NAGphormer attempts to address scalability by employing node tokens in conjunction with vanilla multi-head self-attention, these tokens, which are designed in the spatial domain, suffer from restricted expressiveness. On the other front, some approaches have explored encoding eigenvalues or eigenvectors in the spectral domain to boost expressiveness, but these methods incur significant computational overhead due to the requirement for eigendecomposition. To overcome these limitations, we first introduce node tokens using various polynomial bases in the spectral domain. Then, we propose a tailored polynomial attention mechanism, PolyAttn, which serves as a node-wise graph filter and offers powerful representation capabilities. Building on PolyAttn, we present PolyFormer, a graph Transformer model specifically engineered for node-level tasks, offering a desirable balance between scalability and expressiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods excel at learning arbitrary node-wise filters, showing superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, and handling graphs containing up to 100 million nodes.

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph transformer architecture that uses intra-node attention from polynomial bases computed from said nodes. The method, PolyFormer, achieves good empirical performance on a variety of artifical and real-world tasks. The method is computationally cheaper than existing graph transformer approaches, which also aids scalability.

### Strengths
- The method achieves good empirical performance on a wide variety of artifical and real-world graph datasets.
- The method is computationally cheaper than calculating inter-node attention (O(L^2) instead of O(N^2)) but does not appear to suffer vs methods that do inter-node attention.
- The polynomial basis decomposition is interesting. Specifically, the monomial basis can be interpreted as the number of hops away from a node and still gets reasonable performance

### Weaknesses
- My understanding is that this method uses intra-node attention, where attention is calculated for a set of tokens associated with *each node* and not between nodes. The only cross-node information is from the tokens when they are constructed with A and L. This does not seem like a very efficient way of passing information between nodes, as the cross-node information is hardcoded in the tokens.
- The experiments do not show a large improvement over baseline methods. For example, in Table 2, the ChebNetII baseline performs very well and is not that far off PolyAttn (Cheb). In fact, it outperforms PolyAttn (Mono) on some tasks. This is a bit disappointing since PolyAttn (Mono) is touted as being interpretable, but PolyAttn (Cheb) is the method that outperforms baselines.
- I may have missed this, but are there any experiments showing how PolyAttn scales to more than one PolyAttn layer?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new Graph Transformer called PolyFormer which contains two main steps. In the first step, PolyFormer constructs polynomial tokens for each node. In the second step, PolyFormer leverages a tailored polynomial attention mechanism to learn the final node representations from the constructed polynomial tokens. Empirical results seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of PolyFormer on the node classification task.

### Strengths
1.	This paper introduces different polynomial bases to construct the token sequence for each node.
2.	This paper develops a new attention mechanism to learn node representations from the token sequences.
3.	Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of this paper seems to be limited.
2. More challenging datasets need to be adopted in the experiment.
3. Some experimental settings are not reasonable.

### Questions
1. The proposed PolyFormer actually combines many existing techniques. The Polynomial Token could be regarded as an extension of Hop2Token[1] with different propagation strategies. Moreover, utilizing tanh() to compute the attention score and the node-shared attention bias also have been proposed and successfully implemented in previous works [2] and [3] respectively.
2. More challenging datasets need to be added into the experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PolyFormer, including Actor, Squirrel, Chameleon and ogb-products. The first three are challenging heterophilic datasets and the last one is the representative large-scale graph dataset. Note that, Squirrel and Chameleon should consider the filtered versions proposed in [4]. 
3. I notice that authors conduct the complexity comparison in Section 4.3. The authors keep the total number of parameters approximately same for each model. However, I think the settings of this comparison are not reasonable since it is not the true parameter setting for each model to achieve the best performance on the dataset. Compared to NAGphormer, the proposed PolyFormer introduces order-wise MLP to initialize the query and key matrix, which inevitably increase the training cost. I just wonder the truly training cost of each model on its optimal parameter setting.

### Summary
The paper introduces Polyformer, a novel graph neural network architecture designed to balance scalability and expressiveness for node-level prediction tasks on graphs. It innovatively introduces node tokens based on polynomial bases to efficiently capture node neighborhood information, which not only allows for minibatch training but also enhances scalability. Furthermore, the paper proposes a Polynomial Attention (PolyAttn) mechanism specifically designed for these polynomial node tokens. PolyAttn serves as a node-wise spectral filter, offering more expressive power than the node-unified filters used in previous works. The Polyformer architecture is built using these polynomial node tokens and the PolyAttn mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that Polyformer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, effectively handling graphs with up to 100 million nodes.

### Strengths
- Novel node token formulation using polynomial bases, enabling scalability.
- PolyAttn provides node-wise filtering and enhanced expressiveness.
- Strong experimental results demonstrating scalability and performance.

### Weaknesses
- The polynomial bases are somewhat limited to Monomial and Chebyshev. More advanced bases could be explored.
- Comparisons to very recent graph neural network methods are missing.

### Questions
- How does PolyAttn relate to self-attention in standard Transformers? Is it a specialized version?
- For large graphs, is recomputing the polynomial tokens for each minibatch really efficient?

### Summary
Overall, the research problem is interesting and the research topic of graph transformer is novel. Furthermore, the proposed method PolyFormer method is clearly presented with theoretical analysis, and the experimental results are promising. On the other side, some concerns are raised. Please refer to the following sections for details.

### Strengths
- The research problem is interesting. Trying to reduce the computational complexity and maintaining the effectiveness is pragmatic.

- The proposed method PolyFormer is easy to understand and complete with theoretical analysis.

- The experimental setting is extensive and results are competitive.

### Weaknesses
- The introduction of NAGphormer seems incorrect somehow. On the one hand, the authors mention that NAGphormer was designed based on spatial information and neglected spectral information. On the other hand, the authors mention that NAGphormer attempted to use spectral information but eigendecomposition is costly. It seems contradictory. Moreover, if PolyFormer uses the proposed Monomial Basis especially, it seems that PolyFormer and NAGphormer are under the same general framework. The reviewer would appreciate if the authors could address this concern during the rebuttal.

- The novelty is incremental compared with NAGphormer, PolyFormer adds MLP on each hop aggregation of NAGphormer, to some extent.

- Theorem 1 seems not informative somehow.

### Questions
Extending the first bullet point in the weaknesses section, could the authors explain why the proposed "polynomial token" with PolyAttn is a spectral method, not a spatial method, based on the polynomial type listed in Table 1? 

How to understand $h(\lambda)$ in Figure 1 with $\alpha$ in Eq. 8? Moreover, during the learning process, how to obtain and interpret the low-pass and high-pass?
