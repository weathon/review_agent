- Decision: Accept (poster)

## Abstract
Signal restoration is an important constrained optimization problem with significant applications in various domains. Although non-convex constrained optimization problems have been shown to perform better than convex counterparts in terms of reconstruction quality, convex constrained optimization problems have been preferably for its global optima guarantees. Despite the success of non-convex methods in a large number of applications, it is not an overstatement to say that there is little or no hope for non-convex problems to ensure global optima. In this paper, for the first time, we develop invex constrained optimization theory to mitigate the loss of guarantees for global optima in non-convex constrained inverse problems, where the invex function is a mapping where any critical point is a global minimizer. We also develop relevant theories to extend the global optima guarantee to a set of quasi-invex functions - the largest optimizable mappings. More specifically, we propose a family of invex/quasi-invex of functions for handling constrained inverse problems using the non-convex setting along with guarantees for their global optima. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is very promising and can aid in extending existing convex optimization algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers, and accelerated proximal gradient methods.

### Summary
This work uses the notion of invexity and quasi-invexity in non-convex constrained inverse problems to find global optima.  Through application of admissible functions they build some mathematical tools to show invexity or quasi-invexity of some functions mentioned in the paper. These are the functions which are later used as the loss function or the regularizer in equation (1). Multiple applications of their analysis are studied such as compressive image restoration, total variation filtering, and E-ADMM. Experimental results are provided to support their claims.

### Strengths
1- sound paper, 

2- well-established connection between invexity and various applications, 

3- interesting theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
1- In my opinion, the paper needs major revision in writing, organization, and presentation.

2- In many applications the computational complexity of signal recovery is very high (e.g. in image restoration, application of low-rank matrix recovery in sparse image recovery). This issue was not discussed.

3-The limitations are not mentioned.

4- Some points which might help improving the presentation of the paper

(a) The text is generic in some parts. E.g. in conclusion you mention that your results are very promising, but you do not specify in what sense.

(b) I think Table 3 does not need the second best results highlighted. 

(c)There are some"hard to read" sentence in the text. One example in the introduction is:

"The lack of approaches for guaranteeing the global minima in non-convex settings leaves any optimization-based algorithmic solution incomplete, non-unique, and hence cannot be categorically accepted as the best possible solution despite their improved performance over convex functions."

(d) The E-ADMM sounds like a new algorithm is proposed. Instead, you showed the convergence of the same ADMM under the assumption of invexity/quasi-invexity. The name "E-ADMM" causes confusion.

(e) (11) is referred to as equation. It is an optimization problem.

5- Background on applications in experiments 1,2,3 is not suggested. This is the case at the beginning of every section. Maybe having a separate related work section could help with organizing the paper. 

6- I appreciate the vast context of the paper (signal restoation in a general sense). I think in such cases when the topic entails many applications, you can limit your attention to the main pioneer works in the field. This helps the reader to follow references easier. When one faces 5,6 references on similar topic it might be discouraging or hard to choose references efficiently. I believe it is the writer’s task to present the most efficient references related to their work.

### Questions
1- Was there any computational difference when replacing $L_1$-norm and $L_2$-norm in your first experiment with the proposed functions? 

2- Theorems 5 and 6  prove that some previously known functions satisfy invexity/quasi invexity property. Is it only due to invexity/quasi-invexity that these functions have superior performance in applications listed in table 2? 

3- Do you have any experiments confirming the result in Theorem 7?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of nonconvex constrained optimization in which the objective and constraints are both assumed to be invex (or quasi-invex) functions. The main results are a list of new invex/quasi-invex regularizers and data fidelity loss functions which are constructed based on the concept of admissible functions. Several applications of the proposed invex/quasi-invex functions to compressive image restoration and total variation filtering are provided, along with an extended ADMM algorithm for global optimization. Numerical experiments on relevant tasks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models and algorithms.

### Strengths
The idea of using invex functions for both data fidelity and regularization terms for nonconvex image restoration sounds interesting. The proposed family of admissible functions seems useful for constructing invex loss functions with a unified treatment. The numerical results show some benefits of the proposed approach in a bunch of image restoration tasks.

### Weaknesses
The main concerns are in regard with the significance and correctness of technical contribution.

- As highlighted in Section 3, the authors mainly introduced a set of new invex /quasi-invex functions from the perspective of admissible functions. While these invexity-type functions are guaranteed to be globally minimal at any stationary point, a more challenging problem is how to find these points in a computationally efficient way. This challenge, however, is largely left unaddressed in the present study. The authors did mention an ADMM-style algorithm at the end of Section 4, but it is not quite clear how this algorithm could be exactly used for solving the considered problem formulation in Equation (1). 

- The statements and proof arguments for some of the results in Section 4 are unclear in many places. For example, the statement of Theorem 7 reads a bit confusing, mainly due to that: 1) the comments on extensions are included at the end of the statement, and 2) the quantities $\beta_k^g(x)$ and $v_f(x)$, which are functions of $x$, are claimed as universal constants. Moreover, according the last but one line of the proof of Theorem 7, the quantity $v_f(x)$ should also be dependent on the noise vector $\eta$. In regard with Theorem 8, the first claim that $h$ is convex seems only valid for a proper range of $\lambda$, which needs to be explicitly clarified in the theorem.

### Questions
- Q1. Can you explain in more details how the extended ADMM algorithm as developed in Section 4.3 might be used to solve the constrained invex problem (1) with global guarantees? 

- Q2. In Section 4.1, what is the exact invex problem formulation designed for compressive image restoration? Why the quantities $\beta_k^g(x)$ and $v_f(x)$ in Theorem 7 can be regarded as constants while they are obviously functions of $x$? Also can you say a bit more on the scales of these quantities in the considered problem setting?

### Summary
This paper studies the global optimality of a constrained nonconvex (particularly, invex/quasi-invex) optimization problem for signal restoration, which was found to provide an improved signal quality over the convex optimization-based signal restoration. The invexity property is interesting as it makes any critical point a global minimizer, while being quite nonconvex. This paper not only identifies the invexity of existing non-convex functions (for signal restoration) but also comes up with new invexity functions, based on a new definition of admissible function, yielding a global optimality guarantee. This paper then shows that the standard ADMM also works for constrained "invex" problems. Various experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of using nonconvex but invex functions for both fidelity and regularization terms.

### Strengths
- This identifies various nonconvex but invex constrained signal restoration problems with a global optimality guarantee, theoretically supporting the empirical success of using nonconvex functions in signal restoration.
- This paper provides a set of admissible functions that are invex/quasi-invex, making it easy to identify or construct invex/quasi-invex functions.

### Weaknesses
- The global optimality of quasi-invex function was mentioned in the beginning, but it is not clearly stated after all.
- (Pinilla, 2022a) studied unconstrained signal restoration with invex regularizers, and the contributions of this paper over (Pinilla, 2022a), such as quasi-invexity and the assumptions on the extended ADMM (see question below), are not clearly stated. So they do not seem significant. (The fact that this paper considers a constrained case seems a straightforward extension of (Pinilla, 2022a).) I will reconsider my score depending on the clarification of these contributions.

### Questions
- Are the invex functions considered in this paper prox-friendly? In other words, how is the proximal step of ADMM implemented?
- Does Theorem 9 assume either invexity or quasi-invexity? I was not able to see where such property is used in the proof. It seems the prox-regularity condition is used, which is only a sufficient condition for quasi-invexity. If I am misunderstanding, I suggest revising this part
so that everything is easier to follow.
