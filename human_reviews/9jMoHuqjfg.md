## Abstract
Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models capable of mapping random noise in high-dimensional spaces to a target manifold through iterative denoising. In this work, we present a novel perspective on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by framing it within the context of diffusion modeling. Analogous to the diffusion process, where Gaussian noise is used to create random trajectories that walk away from the data manifold, we construct trajectories that move away from potential goal states. We then learn a goal-conditioned policy analogous to the score function. This approach, which we call Merlin, can reach predefined or novel goals from an arbitrary initial state without learning a separate value function. We consider three choices for the noise model to replace Gaussian noise in diffusion - reverse play from the buffer, reverse dynamics model, and a novel non-parametric approach. We theoretically justify our approach and validate it on offline goal-reaching tasks. Empirical results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods, which suggests this perspective on diffusion for RL is a simple, scalable, and effective direction for sequential decision-making.

### Summary
This paper presents a new approach called Merlin for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, which is inspired from diffusion models. The authors introduce a new approach to construct a "forward process" by stitching trajectories if there are two states from different trajectories are close. The forward process outputs a augmented dataset, and authors propose to learn the corresponding backward process. They validate their method on offline goal-reaching tasks and show competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the paper proposes a new class of goal-conditioned RL algorithms,

### Strengths
1. I like the high level idea of this work which is inspired from diffusion models: constructing a simple forward process to enlarge the training set by injecting noise, and learning the reverse process. Specifically, they use the Nearest-neighbor Trajectory Stitching to generate more data. The algorithm is somewhat novel and might work well on some tasks. 

2. Competitive results: The authors validate their approach on offline goal-reaching tasks and show competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach and its potential for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1. Weak theoretical justification: diffusion models enjoy strong theoretical foundations, the forward and the backward process are proven to share the same marginal distribution. However, it is not clear to me whether the backward process of  Nearest-neighbor Trajectory Stitching still has similar theoretical guarantees.

2. Limited range of applications: Nearest-neighbor Trajectory Stitching seems to be designed for some specific applications. The generalizability remains unclear.

3. Misleading title: Diffusion models have a relatively clear definition now. While there are "forward" and "backward" processes in this paper, this algorithm does not fall into the class of diffusion models.

### Summary
This paper models the offline GCRL problem in offline data in a diffusion process-like paradigm called merlin. The authors consider three choices for the noise model to replace Gaussian noise in diffusion including reverse play from the buffer, reverse dynamics model, and a novel non-parametric trajectory stitching. This is an improved behavioural cloning paradigm without the need to learn an additional value function, which achieves excellent results in offline control tasks.

### Strengths
1.Novel perspective of framing goal-reaching as a diffusion process. 
2.Trajectory stitching technique seems useful for generating diverse state-goal pairs from offline data.
3.Strong empirical results on offline goal-reaching tasks compared to prior methods.

### Weaknesses
1.Although the paper seems to describe a feasible diffusion-like process to model the GCRL problem, I think merlin is essentially a variant of constrained GCSL. From this perspective, merlin has only limited novelty. Start with the cleanest method, merlin build policy upon $s, g, h$ instead of $s, g$ by GCSL. Although the merlin shows better results in the motivation example, I think it's because of the inclusion of a more stable time guide.
2.I observe that Merlin-NP and Merlin-P show better results in the experiments, but they can be considered as GCSL + temporal constraints + reverse dynamics model (Wang et al.) + trajectory stitching (a commonly used data augmentation method in OfflineRL). These other components can be easily combined with the universal GCRL approach, so the performance gains are no surprise. 
3.The approach seems sensitive to hyperparameters like time horizon and hindsight ratio. I'm not sure that good performance comes from hyperparameter tuning.

### Questions
1.What metric and distance threshold works best for the trajectory stitching? Is there a principled way to set this?
2.In appendix table 5, I have observed that there is not much difference in success rate between Merlin and DQL, GCSL and other methods, whereas there is a bigger difference using reward metric, why is that? Success rate should be a common metric for evaluating a GCRL algorithm.

Overall this paper proposes interesting ideas for offline goal-conditioned RL as diffusion process. The empirical results are strong but there are some open questions (see above weakness and questions). Addressing some of the weaknesses and questions raised would strengthen the paper further. I think the central problem is that the article overclaimed the design of the approach to solving the GCRL problem by a diffusion process and I vote reject for current version.

### Summary
The paper proposes a diffusion based method for goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning. It is assumed that a dataset of offline demonstrations is given (which also indicate a goal variable g). This dataset is then used to train a diffusion-model-based policy. The idea is to inverse-diffuse the current sample to eventually arrive at the goal point. Hence, the noising process is in state space, where the idea is that the goal state is continuously noised (generating a reversed trajectory).

### Strengths
- The problem setting is interesting
- The figures are nice and intuitively explain the ideas presented in the paper
- The analogies to behavior cloning are interesting
- Reduction in need for denoising steps is beneficial

### Weaknesses
- The introduction could be improved by making the exact problem setting more clear from the beginning
- The nearest neighbor based approach makes the assumtion that close states are connected/ can be accessd from each other, this should be discussed. This could also be evaluated by designing a more complex toy environment based on the environment in Figure 2.
- The related work description of Janner et all is not exactly correct, as it is not full trajectories that are noised but just trajectory segments
- A comparison to the related works such as [A] would be appreciated
- An ablation on trajectory stitching is only implicitly done (by defining different algorithms)
- A motivation for the goal-conditioned problem setting (instead of starting with just a single goal setting) would be beneficial  
 
-.

- The description of the method is rather confusing. First, it is explained that the trajectory is denoised, which would result in a denoising of states. However, in the following sections, suddenly the action is denoised (see section 4.1)
- Is the policy a diffusion model? It is mentioned that BC is performed at the end of section 5.2.
- The paper would definitely benefit from an algorithm description of the method
- It appears that the dataset extension through trajectory stitching is not performed for the baseline methods, which makes the comparison unfair
- The fact that methods based on inverse dynamics model approaches did not work weakens the method, as trajectoriy stitching has obv. downsides and likely only works in state spaces that resemble physical environments

### Summary
This presents a method for sequential decision making with diffusion. It frames sequential decision making as the reverse process in diffusion. In this case the initial state is “noise” and the final state is the result of denoising. For a particular goal state the policy will “denoise” the initial state. An additional contribution of this work is their “trajectory stitching method”. If there are states that are nearby to one another in two different trajectories then the dataset can be augmented by concatenation of trajectory segments (making sure to relabel the goal state for the swapped trajectories).

### Strengths
Interesting dataset augmentation technique that might improve performance on some control tasks.

### Weaknesses
The trajectory stitching method is only usable if distance between two states can be defined. What if states are observed via images? Additionally what if distance between states is not indicative of their relation to one another in a sequential process. What if there are discontinuities in states?

Transition from 3.2 to 4 is abrupt. No additional information on issues with offline reinforcement learning.

GCSL seems to be a very important concept which is used as a baseline algorithm in this paper. Yet there is no description of it in related work. How is GCSL different from GCRL?

Figure 7 is referenced in the main text but appears in the appendix.

### Questions
is the method applicable with partially observable states e.g., images?
