- Decision: Accept (spotlight)

## Abstract
Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning (ML), but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD.

In this paper, we propose "MMCC'' (matrix mechanism conditional composition), the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as $\epsilon\to0$. 
To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our "conditional composition theorem'' has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our algorithm also has practical empirical utility. We show that amplification leads to significant improvement in the privacy/utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL style algorithms for standard benchmark tasks.

### Summary
Given a set of workload queries, the matrix mechanism identifies a set of basis vectors, adds noise to these basis vectors, and then computes DP answers to workload queries via linear combinations of the perturbed basis vectors. This unique algorithm structure poses a challenge to quantifying the privacy amplification by subsampling in matrix mechanism -- each subsampled sensitive data is possibly reused multiple times in computing different basis vectors (in which case the final noise added to each query is correlated). Due to the lack of such privacy amplification results in prior works, the DP-FTRL algorithm (which uses matrix mechanism as a crucial component) in general does not exhibit better performance than the DP-SGD algorithm. 

- In this paper, the authors prove novel bounds for privacy amplification by subsampling for matrix mechanism. The proof decomposes the output distribution into the composition of multiple mixtures of Gaussian mechanisms, where each mixture component is the conditional distribution of the next basis vector given the participation histories of sensitive data and noisy observations in prior rounds.     
- By using this analysis, the authors improve the existing unamplified privacy guarantee for the binary-tree-FTRL algorithm under shuffling by a multiplicative factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log(n)})$ where $n$ is the size of the dataset. This improvement is supported by numerical experiments. 
- Finally, the authors show that this improved privacy analysis enables performance gain for the DP binary-tree-FTRL algorithm under small $\varepsilon$ under the CIFAR-10 dataset centralized setup.

### Strengths
- Novel bounds for privacy amplification by subsampling in matrix mechanisms. The proof involves several interesting new techniques, such as conditional composition and the analysis of the mixture of Gaussians mechanism. These techniques are of independent interest and may shed light on privacy amplification by subsampling/shuffling for other algorithms in the literature.

- Comparison with related works are discussed thoroughly, making it easy to follow the significance of the results.

### Weaknesses
- The computation cost for the privacy bounds seems high. Namely, the authors need to compute the privacy loss random variable for the product mixture of the Gaussians mechanism, which involves combinatorially many mixture components. Such procedures seem likely to suffer from high computation cost and numerical instability (especially under a small number of rounds or a small $\varepsilon$).

### Questions
- Could the authors discuss more about the computation cost and numerical stability of the proved privacy bound? See weakness for more details.

- Related to the above question, given an arbitrary pair of $\varepsilon, \delta$ values, how computationally feasible is it to compute the appropriate noise scale that ensures $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP of the proposed algorithm?

- In the proof of Lemma B.4, page 15, the third inequality from top $Pr_{x\sim M(D)}[x\geq t]\leq Pr_{x\sim M(D')}[x\geq t]$, is there a typo and $M(D')$ is meant to be $M'(D)$? I'd also like more clarifications regarding why this inequality suffices to show the MoG mechanism $\mathcal{M}$ is dominated by a MoG mechanism $\mathcal{M'}$. Specifically, how this inequality suffice to bound the term $-e^{\varepsilon}Pr_{x\sim M'(D')}[x\geq t]$ in the dominance term $H_{\varepsilon}(M'(D), M'(D'))$.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presented an algorithm for calculating tight privacy guarantees of a generic matrix mechanism. The paper opens with a conditional composition theorem which improves the analysis when the noises are correlated. Building on the first theorem, the paper then derives privacy guarantees for the matrix mechanism under uniform sampling. The paper also includes a case study where the algorithm is applied to the binary tree mechanism, backed by experimental evidence.

### Strengths
1. The theoretical results look novel and sound. The proposed algorithm is also demonstrated effectively in experiments. 
2. The conditional composition theorem could be potentially useful for analyzing general DP mechanisms that involves correlated noise.

### Weaknesses
This paper could be more easy to understand if the author could define the matrix mechanism formally in the beginning with some intuitive interpretation of each variable.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm to improve the privacy analysis for general matrix mechanisms, a major building block behind DP-FTRL. The paper first proposes a “conditional composition theorem”; then the paper characterizes "high-probability PLD" of matrix mechanisms through Mixture of Gaussian mechanisms.

### Strengths
This work is important for the further development of DP-FTRL. The idea of characterizing the worst-case of matrix mechanism through MoG is interesting. The experiment shows improved privacy-utility tradeoff for DP-FTRL.

### Weaknesses
I don't see major problem with this paper. 

However, I did not check the details of the proof (though the high-level idea in the maintext makes sense to me).

### Questions
Can the author comment about the novelty of Theorem 3.1? It seems to be a simple extension of Lemma A.1 in [1]?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of privacy amplification due to subsampling or shuffling for the matrix mechanism, which applies to famous algorithms such as binary-tree based algorithm or DP-FTRL. This problem should be interesting to the DP community.

### Strengths
This paper proposes MMCC, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification for general matrix algorithm. By this method, the paper shows an improved privacy amplification result for the binary-tree based algorithm. Furthermore, the conditional composition theorem, as a side product, should have broader utility. Finally, empirical results reveal a performance improvement due to the better accounting for FTRL.

### Weaknesses
Generally speaking, I do not have too much to complain about this paper. The paper considers an interesting question with some nice results. It also lists some reasonable future directions which may help further strengthen the paper. Some minor comments:

1. Although the new privacy amplification applies and improves DP-FTRL, I still believe this paper is more interesting to the DP theory community. Therefore, ICLR might not be the best fit for this paper.
2. As compared to other FFT-based accounting methods, this algorithm should be much more time-consuming. It remains an interesting question to reduce the running time for some specific use cases.
3. I would like to see the authors further improve the clarity of the paper. For now, the paper is not quite friendly to the readers who do not have full background on DP-FTRL or DP accounting. One specific suggestion is to explain how DP-FTRL and binary-tree based algorithm fit into the framework defined in section 1.2.
