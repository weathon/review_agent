## Abstract
Domain Generalizable ReID task has garnered much attention in recent years, as a more challenging task but more closely aligned with practical applications. Mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods has been studied for DG ReID to exploit the discrepancies and inherent correlations between diverse domains. However, most of DG ReID methods, including MoE-based methods, have to full fine-tune the large amount of parameters of backbones, classifier heads and experts. And in the set of DG ReID, the number of person IDs is particularly large which results in that parameters of classifier heads increases sharply. And make it difficult for MoE-based method to scale up to larger vision models. For this motivation, we propose a novel MoE-based DG ReID method, named mixture of do- main adapters (MoDA), to mitigate the issues men- tioned above. We apply adapter and CLIP to DG ReID in a parameter-efficient way. Extensive experiments verify that MoDA achieves competitive end even better results with state-of-the-art methods with much fewer tunable parameters.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the domain generalization problem of person reID. It proposes a mixture of domain adapters to perform parameter-efficient DG reID. The authors argue that the proposed method is parameter-efficient.

### Strengths
None

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method lacks novelty. As the author said, the proposed method is an integration of CLIP and adapter. The author just uses some hot techniques in the reid domain. I do not see any insight beyond CLIP and Adapter. I do not think this kind of paper can be accepted in any way.
2. The parameter-efficient setting may be meaningless in the DG setting; The number of tunable parameters is not a main concern in the DG reid domain. The author argue that, in the DG setting, the number of parameters of classifier heads is very large. As seen in Table 4, the sum of IDs is still very small. I have trained with 100,000 IDs, no problem exists. Also, I am not sure why you focus on this strange aspect. Fewer parameters do not mean a higher training speed and less VRAM used. I do not think the setting and the intuition of this paper is reasonable.
3. The writing is too poor; The writing of the whole paper is very poor. Also there are some typos: “blcok-aware —> block-aware”. A thorough proofreading is needed. 
4. Not good experiments; in Table 6, your experimental results are much lower than others. I see the tunable parameters are small. But I do not think it is meaningful. Also, have you compared yours with the prompting methods?

### Summary
In this work authors present a method that can handle the domain generalizable person re-identification. Inspired by the previous works in this area, authors designed a network in which they leverage the CLIP Re-ID model with a set of domain specific adapters as well as a domain generalizable adapter termed as Mixture of domain adapters (MoDA) that can efficiently scale up to larger backbones models. Another advantage of this approach is that the expert opinions are mixed even at intermediate stages so that the model can leverage finer information mixing.

### Strengths
The proposed approach is reasonable and clearly outlined. Despite sharing similarities with previous works, authors managed to design expert mixing strategy that results in a more parameter efficient architecture when scaling to larger backbone models for variety of source domains. Additionally, the proposed method achieves competitive results to that of state-of-the-art models when tested in equal environment under the same evaluation protocols.

### Weaknesses
There is no detailed discussion on the obtained results beside merely stating the method achieves better results. It is expected that some insight to be offered as why to the proposed method performs better or worse compared to certain methods. While it is important to know the method has a better accuracy, it is equally as important to know why and how that improvement occurs. Additionally, would be possible for authors to provide some failure cases and some future direction that the designed framework can be enhanced?

### Questions
Could authors provide some explanation on why the proposed method performs slightly better than META under protocol one but META performs better by a good margin under protocol 2?

### Summary
This study focuses on Domain Generalizable ReID (DG ReID) and introduces a new method called Mixture of Domain Adapters (MoDA) to overcome the problem that the model parameters are too large. The proposed MoDA method incorporates Global-Adapter, Export Adapter, Voting Network, and the CLIP technique for DG ReID, resulting in competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
1)	The authors exploit the Global-Adapter, Export Adapter, and Voting Network for DG ReID task.

### Weaknesses
1)	In Tables 1 and Table 2, the bolded font is misleading, and the performance of the ACL and META methods outperforms the proposed method. In particular, the model parameter of ACL is not much larger than that of the proposed method, but the performance of ACL is much higher than that of this paper. 
2)	As shown in Table 3, the Global-Adapter, Export-Adapter, and Voting Network proposed in this paper did not bring significant performance improvement, which makes me doubt the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. 
3)	Abbreviations that appear for the first time need to indicate the full name. For example, in the third line of the abstract, the DG ReID appears for the first time without giving a full description. 
4)	The GELU in Figure 2 is not given a full description, as well as in the text, which can confuse the reader. 
5)	The use of mathematical symbols is not rigorous enough. The i in Formula 1 represents both the image and the index, which is easy to cause ambiguity. 
6)	In Formula 3a, the definition of MA is not stated. 
7)	In Formula 5, the definition of d_p and d_a are not stated. 
8)	The font size in all the figures is too small. 
9)	English writing needs improvement. 
10)	Some grammatical errors. In the top line of section 3.2, “delineates” -> “delineate”

### Questions
Why does this paper not directly use images as the input to the model, but increase the optimization operation of text tokens? The implication of text tokens needs to give a more detailed analysis and experimental demonstration.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Mixture of Domain Adapters (MoDA) framework for DG ReID, which imports CLIP and adapter to achieve the parameter efficiency during the scaling up of MOE.

### Strengths
Although CLIP and adapter are not new, the voting network using of the CLIP-trained ID-specific tokens to save the inference time is a reasonable and interesting idea.

### Weaknesses
1. The improvements in Table.1/2 is slight. The performance is even lower than SOTA. As the advantage of the proposed MoDA is based on the tunable params. I suggest the author to provide a comparison with the same level of tunable params, to see whether the performance can beat other SOTAs.
2. In Eq.11, I do not get the meaning of the Γ+agg and Γ+expert. They are two hardest positive samples, NOT two distances as described, right?
3. What is the difference between "Mixture of Expert Adapters" and "w/o Global Adapter in Mixture of Experts and Global". Moreover, in my opinion, the "Mixture of Expert Adapters" contains no global adapter, what's the meaning of "w/o Global Adapter" in "Mixture of Expert Adapters"?
4. Where is Table.5 in Section4.4?
5. Many mistakes in the writing, such as "The expter branch" in Fig.3 title.

### Questions
I don't like the writing of this paper, but the idea is reasonable. So I prefer to borderline.

### Summary
The authors propose a novel MoE-based Domain Generalizable ReID method called "Mixture of Domain Adapters" (MoDA) to address the challenges faced by existing DG ReID methods. MoDA leverages Adapter-tuning and CLIP in a parameter-efficient manner to mitigate the need for extensive fine-tuning of backbone, classifier head, and expert parameters. Their approach aims to handle the large number of person IDs typically encountered in DG ReID, allowing for better scalability to larger vision models. Many experiments demonstrate that MoDA achieves competitive or even superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters.

### Strengths
The authors of this paper have frozen the weights of CLIP and integrated the "Mixture of Domain Adapters" (MoDA) module for fine-tuning. They applied this technique to ReID and achieved promising experimental results. The performance seems good.

### Weaknesses
This paper encompasses several technologies, including CLIP, PEFT (Adapter), MoE, etc., but none of these were introduced by the authors themselves. Instead, existing technologies were adapted for use in the Re-ID domain. The authors claim, "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to exploit CLIP to DG Person ReID and also the first one to attempt PEFT methods, such as adapter, for DG Person ReID." However, CLIP-ReID [1] and Clip-adapter [2] have already explored these aspects. Furthermore, AdaMix [3] and MixDA [4] have also applied MoE adapter techniques. Utilizing these technologies in the Re-ID field does not necessarily constitute a novel contribution or innovation. It is hoped that the authors can introduce more of their own design elements and emphasize improvements upon prior work.

Perhaps visualizing the relationship between MoE adapters and specific domain or person characteristics could be beneficial. For instance, in Re-ID tasks, conducting a visual analysis to understand when and under what circumstances certain adapters are activated and whether any patterns emerge could provide valuable insights.

In terms of writing, the paper reads more like a technical report combining elements MoE, CLIP, and Adapter based PEFT without a clear focus or coherence. It is suggested to start with a specific problem within DG Re-ID as the motivation, introduce the proposed solution, and emphasize the uniqueness of this approach. The method should not merely be a simple combination of existing techniques, and authors should highlight the distinctive contributions. 

There is room for improvement in the style of the figures and tables as well.
