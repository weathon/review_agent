- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) methods have obtained promising results with moderate model complexity. These approaches primarily focus on a lightweight architecture design, but neglect to further reduce network redundancy. While some model compression techniques try to achieve more lightweight SR models with neural architecture search, knowledge distillation, or channel pruning, they typically require considerable extra computational resources or neglect to prune weights. To address these issues, we propose a flexible meta pruning (FMP) for lightweight image SR, where the network channels and weights are pruned simultaneously. Specifically, we control the network sparsity via channel vectors and weight indicators. We feed them into a hypernetwork, whose parameters act as meta-data for the parameters of the SR backbone. Consequently, for each network layer, we conduct structured pruning with channel vectors, which control the output and input channels. Besides, we conduct unstructured pruning with weight indicators to influence the sparsity of kernel weights, resulting in flexible pruning. During pruning, the sparsity of both channel vectors and weight indicators are regularized. We optimize the channel vectors and weight indicators with proximal gradient and SGD. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate critical factors in the flexible channel and weight pruning for image SR, demonstrating the superiority of our FMP when applied to baseline architectures. Code and models will be released.

### Summary
The manuscript introduces a novel approach, Flexible Meta Pruning (FMP), designed for lightweight image super-resolution. FMP entails the incorporation of network channel vectors and weight tensors into a hypernetwork, facilitating simultaneous pruning and optimization through proximal gradient and SGD. Additionally, the manuscript substitutes the residual block in RLFN with a simplified version and introduces the Lightweight SR Baseline (LSRB). The application of FMP to LSRB demonstrates competitive performances with relatively low computational complexity in several super-resolution experiments.

### Strengths
(1)	The manuscript is presented clearly and well-structured, complemented by easily understandable figures and charts.
(2)	The concept of concurrently combining multiple pruning techniques is intuitive, and the proposed method is straightforward to comprehend and follow.
(3)	The manuscript includes rich ablation studies, and experimental results effectively showcases the superior visual performance achieved by the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
(1)	The manuscript's contribution seems to be incremental, primarily involving the addition of kernel weight pruning based on DHP [1]. While the primary distinction between the proposed method and DHP lies in kernel pruning, the results shown in Table 6 indicate that simultaneous channel and kernel pruning may not significantly show effectiveness over channel pruning alone.
(2)	Some of the experimental comparisons may be perceived as lacking in both fairness and completeness when it comes to demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. Notably, in Figure 1, the analysis exclusively focuses on showcasing the influence of FMP. However, it's important to note that the baseline models utilized for evaluating FMP and other comparative methods differ. This dissimilarity in the baseline models pose challenges when attempting to assess the precise impact of FMP. Besides, in subsection 4.2, the experimental comparisons fail to cover some classic lightweight SR models including RLFN and ELAN, which are also mentioned in Section 1 and Section 2
(3)	The manuscript does not sufficiently address the compatibility and generalizability of the proposed FMP method. Although FMP was developed for lightweight super-resolution, experiments have only been conducted on one model, LSRB. The suitability of applying FMP to other super-resolution models remains unexplained.

### Questions
(1)	What optimization method was employed for the FMP method outlined in the manuscript? While the introduction section mentions SGD and proximal gradient descent, the experimental setup section suggests the use of Adam for FMP. This inconsistency is expected to be clarified.
(2)	LSFB represents a lightweight network achieved by replacing residual blocks in RLFN with simplified versions, and FMP is a lightweight method. Table 3 indicates that LSFB+FMP exhibits higher model parameters and computational complexity compared to RLFN. Could you provide an explanation for this discrepancy? Furthermore, LSFB+FMP demonstrates increased inference speed, despite the primary goal of parameter optimization not being fast adaptation in meta-learning. The reasons behind the improved inference speed is expected to be addressed and analyzed.
(3)	FMP introduces kernel weight pruning in addition to DHP, and the results in Table 4 is intended to show that FMP outperformances DHP. However, the combination of multiple pruning techniques may not always lead to an improved result. Besides, it seems that the higher the prune ratio, the better for the performances of both DHP and FMP. Both appear to be counterintuitive to some extents. Therefore, more detailed analysis and explanation are necessary here.
(4)	Formula (6) is similar to formula (7) because it needs to calculate the norm as well. However, why not trying to choose the suitable norm through experiments in the same way adopted to determine the norm in formula (7)?
(5)	In ESA module of LSRB, spatial attention is used instead of convolution. Is this module involved in the proposed pruning method?

### Summary
This paper proposes a flexible meta pruning (FMP) for lightweight image super-resolution (SR). The basic idea of FMP is interesting and consists of structured and unstructured pruning simultaneously during the SR network training. The authors propose channel vectors and weight indicators to control channel and weight sparsity of SR network. A simple yet effective SR backbone (LSRB) is also designed. Extensive ablations show the effect of several key structures and methods, like LSRB, flexible pruning, pruning method. The main comparisons with others also show that the proposed FMP achieves good performance.

### Strengths
The idea about flexible meta pruning (FMP) is straightforward but effective. FMP conduct structured and unstructured pruning simultaneously in the SR training, which makes the pruning and SR reconstruction more optimized.

The authors propose channel vectors and weight indicators to control network sparsity and optimize them with proximal gradient and SGD respectively. Such different optimization methods make the differentiable and flexible pruning easily.

Extensive ablation studies are conducted to show the effect of each proposed key component, like effect of the baseline LSRB, pruning method, flexible vs. channel pruning.

The authors compare with recent related methods and achieve better performance with both quantitative and visual results. The authors provide PSNR/SSIM, visual results, and also model complexity analyses. Those results further support the claimed contributions.

The authors further discuss convergence criteria and compare with other model compression methods (e.g., NAS, KD, and channel pruning). In this comparison, the proposed FMP still show obvious gains over others.

The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The overall paper is well-organized.

The authors promise to release code, which makes the reproducibility easier and the experiments more solid.

### Weaknesses
The performance gains shown in Table 4 seem to be marginal. Did the results of DHP and FMP obtained by using same number of iterations or not? According to the paper, it seems that they may use different iterations based on the convergence criteria. If FMP uses less iterations and achieves similar or better results than DHP, then it makes sense. Please clarify this.

The authors mainly apply FMP to CNN based networks, like EDSR and LSRB. It is also important to apply this method to other structures, like Transformer-based methods. So that, we can see how well its generalization ability is.

When applying the proposed FMP to other SR methods, do people have to modify too much parts of the new models? It seems that FMP can also be used for other image restoration methods. If so, it is better to discuss in the paper.

More recent methods can be compared. For example, ICLR-2022-SRPN can also be discussed and compared.

### Questions
The performance is obviously better than others. Did the authors used self-ensemble during the test phase?

In practice, does FMP save more running time than channel or weight pruning? Or does FMP need specific hardware to reach obvious reduction of resource (e.g., GPU memory and running time)?

### Summary
This paper proposes a flexible mera pruning method named FMP, which combines the merits of both structural and unstructured pruning, leading to better trade-off between accuracy and latency.

### Strengths
1. The idea of combining the merits of structured and unstructured pruning is straightforward and promising.

2. The experiments show that the proposed method can surpass the competitors with fewer parameters and less latency.

3. The paper is well written and the idea is clearly illustrated.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors argue that unstructured pruning does not contribute to actual acceleration. However, the experiments in Table 1 do not include comparisons of latency.

2. Some leading lightweight methods are missed in Table 1, e.g. MegSR[1], VapSR[2], Omni-SR[3]. The authors are suggested to provide comparisons over varied model sizes to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, because we can not justify whether it can maintain its advantage among smaller models (~400 K params).

3. Table 4 compares only one pruning method because other methods use pretrained SR backbones. However, to better justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the authors can add more comparisons by also using a pretrained backbone. The pretrained backbone does not increase the inference cost and should not be viewed as a drawback of lightweight SR methods.

4. According to Table 3, the backbone used by FMP already brings some improvements. Thus comparisons in Table 7 may be not fair. The authors are suggested to provide the results of applying ASSLN to  LSRB.
