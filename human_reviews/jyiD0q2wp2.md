## Abstract
When observing a person's body, humans can extract the structured representation of the body called a parse graph, which includes the hierarchical decompositions from the entire body to parts and primitives and the context relations by horizontal links between the body parts. This ability helps humans better locate body structures at different levels. In order for the model to have this ability for human pose estimation (HPE), We design a hierarchical network to model the context relations and hierarchical structure in the parsing graph by convolutional neural networks. It overcomes the problem that most methods ignore context relations in the inference of hierarchical structure for HPE. Our network contains bottom-up and top-down stages. In the bottom-up stage, the structural features of the hierarchy are captured from primitives to parts and the entire body. Then in the top-down stage, with the context information of each body part, the structural features of the body parts are refined separately rather than together from the entire body to parts and primitives. Experiments show that our model enhances the reasonableness of predictions and achieves superior results on the COCO keypoint detection and MPII human pose datasets.

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the human pose estimation task and proposes a method to model the context relations and hierarchical structure in the parsing graph of body structure by using convolutional neural networks.

### Strengths
1. The writing is good and easy to follow.
2. The paper model the context relations and hierarchical structure in the body structure.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental results of this paper are rather poor, and it does not cite some of the recent methods: DARK[1], UDP[2], ViTPose[3], PCT[4].
2. The authors claim in the Introduction that it should be the first time that the context relations and hierarchical structure in the parse graph of body structure are explicitly modeled by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for HPE. However, many papers from 2018 have already made such attempts: [5,6,7] and the authors did not cite any of them.
3. This paper does not conduct any ablation study.

### Questions
I think bottom-up and top-down are two specific terms in the context of human pose estimation and using them in the description of your method may not be quite appropriate.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to capture both the visual features and body structure for human pose estimation. It first predicts heatmaps of primitives, parts and body at the bottom-up stage, then refine the outputs of different levels at the top-down stage. The estimation results are improved after refinement.

### Strengths
The structure of human body is explicitly exploited in the manner of bottom-up and top-down stages for the task of human pose estimation. The experiments on the COCO and MPII datasets show the superiority of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The contribution of this paper is somewhat incremental. The structure of human body has been widely used as a prior for the task of human pose estimation. The detailed comparison including theoretical analysis and experimental results should be provided to validate the superiority of the proposed method over the previous approaches (e.g., how to avoid the over-fitting problem as mentioned in the introduction section). 

The applied parse graph is critical to this work. The effect of different parse graphs and the effectiveness of the parse graph applied in this work should be evaluated in the experiments, which is missing in the current version.

The computational complexity of the proposed approach is expected to be compared with those of the existing methods. The proposed method can be regarded as a refinement module added to HRNet, so the model complexity is a concern.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes an new approach for 2D pose estimation with a parse graph. The proposed method, as the author states, is the first time that uses CNN to model the contextual relations and hierarchical structure while simultaneously employing both top-down and bottom-up approaches in the network.This work enhances the reasonableness of predictions and achieves superior results on the COCO keypoint detection and MPII human pose datasets.

### Strengths
1. The idea of representing the human body's structure using parse graphs is simple and intuitive.
2. The paper is well-written with good illustrations and visualizations of results for important cases

### Weaknesses
1. The innovation in this paper may not be entirely clear. It seems to me that proposed method is a combination of ideas from previous works. The paper could benefit from further clarifying the differences and new contributions compared to existing methods. 
2. The performance of the proposed method is not impressive and the experiments do not compare with SOTA methods, e.g., VitPose [1].

### Summary
The paper proposes a hierarchical network for human pose estimation based on the parse graph of body structure. The network consists of a top-down stage and a bottom-up stage, which work together to refine the pose estimation results. The top-down stage utilizes context information and prior fusion to improve the accuracy of the predictions, while the bottom-up stage generates coarse predictions based on the input image. Experiments are conducted on COCO and MPII. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed module.

### Strengths
1. Solving human pose estimation with graph-based representation is reasonable and important.
2. The paper provided the quantitative evaluation, ablation study, and qualitative evaluation.

### Weaknesses
**Weakness:**

1.	Overclaim. “As far as we know, this should be the first time that the context relations and hierarchical structure in the parse graph of body structure are explicitly modeled by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for HPE.” This statement is overclaimed. In fact, there are a number of papers exploiting hierarchical structure of the human body. For example, [a] proposes hierarchical graph grouping for a more challenging multi-person pose estimation problem. [b-h] are works that apply graphical model for single-person human pose modeling. Please discuss the relationship of these works and compare with them.
2.	The novelty of this paper is concerning, especially considering the missing discussion of the related works [a-h].
3.	Somewhat insufficient experimental validation.
a)	The experiments are conducted on COCO and MPII. The accuracy of MPII is near saturated (over 90 PCKh). Please consider using other challenging datasets, e.g. CrowdPose[i]. 
b)	State-of-the-art methods are not compared. It does not achieve the state-of-the-art performance. For example, ViTPose[j]. And most importantly, PGNN[i] is also a graph-based model which achieves 92.5 on MPII test, better than this submission (92.0) but not reported. 
c)	Computational efficiency: The paper may not address the computational complexity or efficiency of the proposed method, which could be a concern in practical applications. Please report the FLOPs and runtime speed, and compare it with other approaches (e.g. HRNet).
d)     The ablation study is conducted on MPII, where the performance gap is insignificant. Please consider using COCO for ablation study.

**Minor:**

1.	The paper requires careful proof reading.

2.	The format of the submission does not meet the standards of ICLR2024. Please use the template provided.

3.	There are repeated entries in the References. Please correct them. 

4.	Table1 & Table2, it is suggested noting “HRNet-W32” instead of “W-32” for the backbone for easier understanding.
