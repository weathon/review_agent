# Deep SE(3)-Equivariant Geometric Reasoning for Precise Placement Tasks

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Many robot manipulation tasks can be framed as geometric reasoning tasks, where an agent must be able to precisely manipulate an object into a position that satisfies the task from a set of initial conditions. Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack.  In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise placement predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel model for implementing the SE(3)-equivariance in robotic pick and place problems. Given a task involving placing an object relative to another object, the method first uses an equivariant network to calculate the desired distance between points on the two objects. The core innovation of the method is that given the desired distances from a point on object A to a set of points on object B, one can use multilateration to locate the desired location of this point relative to object B. Repeating this process for multiple points on object A, the relative pose between A and B could then be confirmed. The proposed method is evaluated against a number of baselines, where it demonstrates commendable performance, especially when the task requires high precision.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using multilateration to calculate the relative pose is a compelling aspect of this paper. It transforms the equivariant problem of calculating the desired relative pose into an invariant problem of calculating the desired relative distance, which could be useful to reduce the complexity of a model.
2. The paper is well-written with intuitive examples to illustrate the idea.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with the paper is that the experimental evaluation is not strong enough. In the main paper, the experiments are mainly conducted in the Mug Hanging domain. In the two other domains in Table 3 in the appendix, the proposed method’s performance is worse than the baselines. Though the authors discuss that the underperformance compared with TAX-Pose could be due to the lack of the implementation of the symmetry-breaking technique, the proposed method also lags behind NDF. Additionally, the performance of DON and NDF under 1cm and 3cm distance thresholds is not reported in either Table 1 or Table 3.

### Questions
1. As is mentioned in Weakness, my main comment is about the experiment section. The paper would be much stronger if there is an environment that actually requires high place precision (e.g., gear/kit assembly) rather than merely adjusting the precision requirement in the mug-hang task. Moreover, incorporating the performance of NDF under the 1cm and 3cm precision requirements in Tables 1 and 3 would likely strengthen the paper as well.
2. Does the proposed method have a faster runtime compared with the baselines? Does the proposed method have a higher sample efficiency? Since the idea of using multilateration reduces the equivariant problem into an invariant problem, I am curious about if there are benefits from this angle.

### Summary
This paper propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. The core technical contribution is to transform the optimization of two SE(3) fields into a differentiable multilateration problem.

### Strengths
- This paper proposes a method that tackles SE(3)-equivariant learning by estimating the  corresponding point pairs with differentiable multilateration. The method provides the community with some fresh new ideas.
- This paper is in general written in a clear way, and is easy to comprehend.

### Weaknesses
- Presentation
    - The problem statement section as well as some figures are directly borrowed from TAX-Pose. I think it severely damages the presentation of this paper.
- Performance
    - The result in Table 1 is margianl improvement compared with PAX-Pose, though the proposed method does exhibit some advantages in higher-precision settings.
- Real-world experiments
    - This method is evaluated with offline real-world trajectories collected by TAX-Pose. I won't accept this as real-world experiments.
    - In figure, the rotational error is 35 degrees. While the authors have made some explanations, I won't regard it as a satisfactory result.

### Questions
- Will there be genuine real-world experiments conducted in the future?

### Summary
The paper presents a system that is provably SE(3)-Equivariant for predicting task-specific object poses for relative placement tasks. It introduces a new cross-object representation called RelDist, an SE(3)-Invariant geometric reasoning framework, and employs multilateration and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract relative pose predictions. The study validates the representation’s performance through simulated high-precision tasks and real-world manipulation demonstrations, emphasizing its applicability to point cloud data.

### Strengths
The paper's originality lies in its novel representation for cross-object relationships and the formulation of a problem-solving approach that is SE(3)-Equivariant. The quality of the work is high, evidenced by the clear methodology and promising experimental results. The clarity of the presentation is commendable, with complex concepts and processes being explained with precision. The experiment results are supportive to the precision requirement of the tasks and explained by the algorithm design. Lastly, the significance of the work is underlined by its practical applications in robotics and potential to influence future research in the area.

### Weaknesses
Although the experimental results are positive and supportive to the claims on e.g., precision and the algorithm design, more tasks or scenarios could be evaluated. They can still be precise pick and place but should at least be different sets of objects, such as peg-in-hole.  The methodology looks pretty promising (equivariant + differentiable optimization process) and generic, as a submission to a ML conference, one would expect to see a more diverse evaluation of the approach.

Other weaknesses identified pertain to limitations in handling symmetric objects or multimodal placement tasks, as acknowledged by the authors. This could restrict the system's application in scenarios where multiple correct poses exist. Additionally, the requirement for segmented task-relevant objects can be a significant limitation in unstructured environments. The paper could be improved by exploring these aspects further, possibly by integrating generative models or unsupervised segmentation methods.

However, overall, I would still think the paper is slightly above the threshold, while a more complete evaluation could well strengthen the paper.

### Questions
- Could experimental results be further augmented with a more diverse set of tasks or scenarios? What could be the choices?
- How does the system handle noisy data or incomplete point clouds, common in real-world scenarios?
- Could the authors elaborate on potential strategies for overcoming the limitations related to symmetric objects or multimodal placements?
