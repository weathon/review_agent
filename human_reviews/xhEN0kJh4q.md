- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
Protein design, a grand challenge of the day, involves optimization on a fitness landscape, and leading methods adopt a model-based approach where a model is trained on a training set (protein sequences and fitness) and proposes candidates to explore next. These methods are challenged by sparsity of high-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the literature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the distribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not designed for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of “separation” in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome the problem. We demonstrate its advantage over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance and separation between low- and high-fitness samples. Our comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcases the generality of our approach in discrete and continuous design spaces. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/sabagh1994/PGVAE.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
1: You are unable to assess this paper and have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from different reviewers.

### Summary
Authors propose to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to model a protein engineering task. Obtained model would allow scientists from the area to better know where to look for promising compounds in such difficult search space. They argue that their approach is more effective and efficient than other normally attempted approaches, such as RL guided searches or evolutionary optimization. Authors provide some experimental assessments that include experiments with artificial datasets to properly evaluate their approach.

### Strengths
Unfortunately, Bioinformatics is far outside my scope areas. I can't really assess quality of the paper. For the untrained eye, everything seems to fit. The proposed approach seems correct for the task at hand (as far as I could understand it), but I'm completely unfamiliar with the related work, can't really say if this has been attempted before for this particular domain, or to what extent. All I can say is that presentation of the paper is good, and the artificial dataset experiments somewhat seem to validate what authors attempted to do.

### Weaknesses
As I already mentioned, I can't really assess the draft.
The only one thing that I'd like to bring forward, it's that for the given bioinformatics task described -as far as I could understand it- VAEs seem like a natural thing to try. I'm surprised nobody has done it before; but since I'm unfamiliar with the Related Work, surely there are things that I'm missing.

### Questions
I'm leaning a bit towards rejection of the paper, just for the reason I mentioned in the 'weaknesses' section, about novelty and contribution. 
But if other reviewers go with acceptance, I won't argue against.
AC has been alerted to seek another opinion if needed.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper identifies the scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions for model-based optimization for sequence-function landscapes, named separation, and proposes a new method using a variational auto-encoder to explicitly structure the latent space by property values of the sequences such that more desired samples are prioritized over the less desired ones and have higher probability of generation. Empirical studies on three real and semi-synthetic protein datasets show the robustness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1.	This paper identifies the problem of separation for model-based optimization for sequence-function landscapes.
2.	A robust method based on a variational auto-encoder is proposed to solve the separation and sparsity problems.
3.	Empirical studies are conducted on three real and semi-synthetic protein datasets to study the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1.	A clear description of the robustness concept needs to be provided for friendly reading.
2.	A description of the organization of this paper as well as a Conclusion session should be added.

### Questions
What is the maximum dimensionality examined in the experiments? How will the proposed method perform when increasing the dimensionality of an optimization problem?

### Summary
Note: I am not familiar with the field of protein design, so this review is largely from the perspective of generative modelling.

**Problem Setting**

We are considering the problem of protein design, in which data consists of sparse examples of high-fitness designs. Due to the nature of the optimization problem, it is desirable to learn a model that can judge the fitness of specific sequences.

**Novel Idea**

This work proposes the learning of a weighted VAE such that high-fitness samples are weighted in the probability distribution. The intuition is that exploration in VAE space is more likely to result in succesful generations with this bias in place. However, all samples can still be used in training the model.

The PPGVAE is structured so that designs with higher fitness are generated closer to the origin. This means they will be more likely to be sampled when using a normal distribution prior. This is implemented in the form of a constraint between the ratio of log probabilities vs. fitness, and this constraint is relaxed to a weighted penalty.

**Findings**

Experiments showcase that the PPGVAE model can correctly separate between two modes. The modes are defined as the probabilities represented by a two-mode Gaussian mixture model. On protein datasets, the method showcases that the PPGVAE can separate between low and high fitness examples, and that separated models lead to faster convergence when using MBO.

### Strengths
This paper presents a useful method for learning an exploration prior for model based optimization. In the area of protein design, there are sparse examples of high fitness designs, and many low fitness designs. A good prior should bias towards the space of high-fitness designs, while still making use of all examples. This work presents a simple and clean objective that learns a variational auto-encoder. The methodology is clear and theoretical justification is provided. It may provide significance in the specific problem domain, although the method itself is domain-agnostic.

### Weaknesses
The figures of the paper were confusing in terms of what message they were trying to convey. A more informative caption describing why the results are important would improve the clarity here.

The experiments do showcase the the proposed architecture helps in terms of separating high-fitness examples. It would be insightful to include some experiments on what happens if the VAE is simply trained on only the high-fitness examples and the low-fitness examples are dropped altogether. 

It is unclear the difference between the hard constraint and the soft constraint. Are these just different hyperparameters on the penalty? Or is it a true constraint using i.e. a Lagrange multiplier?

### Questions
See above for a list of questions.

Is the intent of this work to be applicable to other domains, or only protein design? If the answer yes, as implied by the title, it would be greatly strengthening to apply this method on more classical generative modelling tasks larger than MNIST.

### Summary
The paper addresses a crucial challenge in protein design, which involves optimization on a fitness landscape. The main concern in current model-based optimization methods is the sparsity of high-fitness samples in training datasets and the separation problem - wherein the desired optimum is situated in a region that is poorly represented and far from low-fitness areas. This paper pinpoints that existing tools do not efficiently handle this separation problem in the design space.

The authors introduce a new method using Property-Prioritized Generative Variational Auto-Encoder (PPGVAE). This VAE's latent space is structured by the fitness values of the samples, ensuring higher prioritization and generation probability for more desired sequences. This new method aims for better results with fewer optimization steps, which is particularly valuable for sequence design problems.
A comparative advantage of this approach over prior methods is demonstrated via extensive benchmarks on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets. 

The PPGVAE proves to be superior in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance between low- and high-fitness samples and the degree of their separation in the design space. The authors further extend the versatility of their method by testing it on continuous design spaces, showcasing its efficacy on physics-informed neural networks (PINN).

### Strengths
1. The paper recognizes the less-explored challenge of "separation" in protein design space, which is a significant departure from recent studies that have mostly focused on the sparsity of high-fitness samples. And The PPGVAE proposed in the paper is an effective approach to tackling the separation issue in model-based optimization.

2. The paper does not just present a theoretical model but comprehensively demonstrates its effectiveness through extensive benchmarking on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets. Beyond just protein datasets, the paper further validates the model on continuous design spaces, exemplified with physics-informed neural networks (PINN).

### Weaknesses
1. Limitation on the conducting experiments exclusively on the real protein dataset of AAV. While this might result in high accuracy and performance metrics within this context, the method may not readily translate to other proteins or protein datasets, especially if they possess distinct characteristics or functionalities.

### Questions
1. How easily can PPGVAE be extended to prioritize or balance multiple properties simultaneously? Would this require a significant alteration to the existing framework? 
2. Could you provide insights into the sensitivity of the model's performance to changes in the temperature in the relationship loss?
