## Abstract
One of challenge in reinforcement learning lies in the meticulous design of a reward function that quantifies the quality of each decision as a scalar value. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides an alternative approach, avoiding reward engineering by learning rewards based on human preferences among various trajectories. PbRL involves sampling informative trajectories, learning rewards from preferences, optimizing policy with learned rewards, and subsequently generating higher-quality trajectories for the next iteration, thereby creating a virtuous circle. Distinct problems lie in effective reward learning and aligning the policy with human preferences, both of which are essential for achieving efficient learning. Motivated by these considerations, we propose an efficient preference-based RL method, dubbed SEER. We leverage state-action pairs that are well-supported in the current replay memory to bootstrap an empirical Q function ($\widehat{Q}$), which is aligned with human preference. The empirical Q function helps SEER to sample more informative pairs for effective querying, and regularizes the neural Q function ($Q_\theta$) thus leading to a policy which is more consistent with human intent. Theoretically, we show that the empirical Q function is a lower-bound of the oracle Q under human preference. Our experimental results over several tasks demonstrate that the empirical Q function is beneficial for preference-based RL to learn a more aligned Q function, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

### Summary
It is known in PbRL that the inaccurate reward model compounding with overestimation bias on Q functions can lead to sub-optimal policies, and subsequently cause poor trajectory sampling and low feedback efficiency. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a non-parametric, graph-based model to learn a lower bound empirical Q-value, and then combined it with a SAC-style policy learning objective. Although the motivation is good, the proposed method suffers from a number of noticeable drawbacks. Please see the following strengths and weaknesses for detailed comments.

### Strengths
- The compounding issue of inaccurate reward and overestimation bias is an important problem in PbRL, and worth investigating.
- The idea of correcting overestimated Q values in online PbRL is interesting.
- The proposed method has shown reasonable performance and low variance in the test environments.

### Weaknesses
- One of the biggest problems of this paper is that its graph-structured non-parameterized model is only applicable to tasks with discrete states space, or tasks with states and actions that can be enumerated (like the image-based task considered in this paper, there are only finite possible image outcomes). For general continuous control tasks, this method is very impractical. This limits the technical contribution of this work.
- The reason to introduce the non-parametric model as claimed in this paper, is to avoid query unseen actions and avoid overestimation. If this is the case, then why not consider incorporating well-established techniques from offline RL on the replay buffer, like in [1]? Some in-sample learning offline RL methods such as IQL[2] (and a few other methods) can achieve exactly the same purpose but in a much simpler way. The only extra benefit of adopting a graph-based model is the ability to sample new trajectories from the graph, but this part is not carefully ablated, and we do not know whether the performance gains are primarily due to non-overestimated Q values or trajectory sampling.
- Most of the proposed method is to prevent the overestimation of Q values, and it is only weakly relevant to the PbRL problem. Of course, the inaccurate rewards in PbRL can cause the overestimation issue to have a greater impact, but I do not see too many technical designs that are specifically designed for the PbRL problem.
- As for Theorem 3.1, the authors only proved $\hat{Q}$ will lower bound and converge to $Q^*$ learned using Bellman optimality equation under tabular case. However, it says nothing about the property of the final Q-value learned using Eq.(5). There is no analysis on the final Q-value learned with the soft Bellman residual and the distribution-constrained loss, which makes the theoretical analysis insignificant.
- The evaluations are only conducted in two special test environments that are compatible with the graph-structured model. Common PbRL benchmarks like B-Pref are not evaluated. I suppose the proposed method simply cannot run on such continuous control tasks.

### Questions
- I suspect that there should be a trade-off weight hyperparameter on $L_{dc}$ in Eq.(5). As the bellman loss and the regularization term $L_{dc}$ need to be properly balanced to enable stable learning. Have you used a weight hyperparameter here? And if so, how is it tuned?
- The variances in PbRL methods are typically large, but the reported variance of the proposed method is surprisingly small. Why is that?
- The preferences in the experiments are collected from script teachers. How will the method perform if the preference labels come from humans, which contain more noise?

### Summary
This paper considers preference-based reinforcement learning and proposes a new policy learning algorithm which can fit into the current framework of PbRL. In each iteration, it first constructs an empirical estimation of the optimal policy and its corresponding distribution-constrained loss. Then it computes the Q function of the current policy via soft Bellman residual and the distribution-constrained loss. After that it applies soft improvement to the current policy with the estimated Q function. 

The authors prove that the empirical Q function is an asymptotical lower bound of the optimal Q function. They also conduct numerical experiments to validate the performance of PEBBLE with the proposed policy learning algorithm.

### Strengths
The proposed algorithm seems to achieve better performance with PEBBLE in the empirical tasks than SOTA.

### Weaknesses
(1) The proposed algorithm seems to only modify the existing framework of maximum entropy RL a little bit and not very novel.

(2) The paper only shows that empirical Q function is a lower bound of the ground-truth optimal Q function. I think the distribution-constrained loss is more reasonable if the authors can further show the empirical Q function is close to the ground-truth optimal Q function.

### Questions
Why do the authors use the KL divergence between $\hat{\pi}(s)$  and $\pi_{ soft(\theta)}(s)$ as the regularization term? A more intuitive choice would be the direct distance between $Q_{\theta}$ and $\hat{Q}$.

### Summary
The paper introduces SEER, an efficient framework for preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL). Traditional RL poses challenges in creating reward functions. SEER tackles this problem by learning rewards based on human preferences among various trajectories, creating a virtuous circle of learning. The main innovation lies in the empirical Q function derived from past trajectories, improving the sampling process and policy regularization. Experimental results demonstrate SEER's significant edge over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with limited human feedback.

### Strengths
1. Innovative Approach: SEER presents a novel method of leveraging historical trajectories to construct an empirical Q function. This Q function aids in bootstrapping and enhances policy learning.
2. Efficiency: On the domains tested, SEER appears to outperform baselines. 
3. Theoretical Underpinning: The paper provides a theoretical demonstration that the empirical Q function serves as a lower-bound of the oracle Q under human preference.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness with the paper is in the experimental evaluation. All of the other baselines test on the same broad suite of simulated robotics tasks. Since this paper follows from those papers and directly compares against them, those environments should definitely be included in the evaluation. 

Another weakness is with the presentation. There are a lot of grammar mistakes throughout, for example the first sentence in abstract should be “One of the challenges… “ also in abstract “optimizing policies”, also citation (III and Sadigh) should be Hejna III and Sadigh. I think related works could be improved a lot. For example, the main baseline methods are not well-described in this section.

### Questions
Evaluation: How well does SEER do on the benchmarks that are common in the literature? Is there a reason those benchmarks are not included? 
Generalizability: How adaptable is SEER across different domains or problems? Can it be seamlessly integrated into other existing RL algorithms?
Human Feedback: How does SEER handle potentially conflicting or inconsistent human preferences? Is there a mechanism to resolve such conflicts?

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel framework for preference-based reinforcement learning, asserting that their results enhance label efficiency. They provide experimental verification of this claim.

In my understanding, the proposed framework is roughly as follows. 

After unsupervised exploration without rewards, iterate 
* 1) Sample from trajectories based on the constructed graph and get the preference feedback  
* 2) Update rewards from a pair of trajectories and preferences.
* 3) Update a graph and an empirical Q-function with updated rewards  (in a conservative way) 
* 4) Learn a soft Q-function and an associated policy by using soft Bellman loss + regularization based on a policy corresponding to an optimal policy from the empirical conservative Q-function in Step 3.

### Strengths
The framework appears to be novel. Experimental results are solid.

### Weaknesses
Certain aspects of the paper remain unclear. My primary concern revolves around the justification for the effectiveness of the proposed framework. While there are several intuitive statements provided and there are solid experiments, they often lack the formal exposition for readers to gain a comprehensive understanding.

* I comprehend the author's assertion regarding the conservatism of the empirical Q-function. However, I am seeking clarification regarding the formal properties of the resulting policy, denoted as SAC $\pi_{\phi}$. Are we anticipating it to exhibit conservatism or optimism? Additionally, the author contends that it "aligns with human preference." Could this alignment be elucidated in a more rigorous manner?

* The author state that "theoretically, we demonstrate that the empirical Q-function is a lower-bound of ...." in the Abstract. However, it is challenging to discern the precise details from Theorem 3.1. in a main text. Several elements remain undefined, such as the exact meanings of $Q_t$ and $\hat Q_t$ in the main text, as well as the underlying assumptions (e.g., do we need assumptions for rewards to say $\hat Q_t$ converges to $Q^{\star}$?  ) 

* The proposed framework appears to be tailored for tabular settings, primarily due to its reliance on an empirical Q-function. How does the author intend to extend this approach to accommodate continuous settings, particularly in terms of both algorithmic and theoretical considerations?

* In a related context, update (3) seems somewhat naive in addressing the data coverage concern. I agree it might be beneficial to differentiate between actions that have not been visited, actions that have been visited. But how can we distinguish actions that fall in between – perhaps those visited frequently versus those visited infrequently?

### Questions
I raised several questions in the weakness part. Furthermore, 

* Would you explain Line 8 in Algorithm 1 more? How did you sample a pair of trajectories? Does this correspond to the "Sampling informative trajectories part"?
