# Covariance-corrected Whitening Alleviates Network Degeneration on Imbalanced Classification

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Class imbalance is a critical issue in image classification that significantly affects the performance of deep recognition models. In this work, We first identify a network degeneration dilemma that hinders the model learning by introducing a high linear dependence among the features inputted into the classifier. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Whitening-Net to mitigate the degenerate solutions, in which ZCA whitening is integrated before the linear classifier to normalize and decorrelate the batch samples. However, in scenarios with extreme class imbalance, the batch covariance statistic exhibits significant fluctuations, impeding the convergence of the whitening operation. Therefore, we propose two covariance-corrected modules, the Group-based Relatively Balanced Batch Sampler (GRBS) and the Batch Embedded Training (BET), to get more accurate and stable batch covariance, thereby reinforcing the capability of whitening. Our modules can be trained end-to-end without incurring substantial computational costs. Comprehensive empirical evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist-LT, validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

### Summary
This paper proposes a normalization method with class-aware sampling to cope with class imbalance in long-tailed classification. By analyzing covariance matrices of features trained on an imbalanced dataset, the authors find out the issue of long-tailed learning that learnt feature components heavily correlate with each other, degrading rank of feature representation. To mitigate it, the proposed method embeds a whitening module to decorrelate features and applies a sampling strategy based on class distribution toward stable training. In the experiments on long-tailed image classification, the method exhibits competitive performance with the other approaches.

### Strengths
+ Analysis about feature covariance is interesting and effectively inspires the authors to embed feature decorrelation into neural networks.
+ Performance is empirically evaluated on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of the method in comparison to the others.

### Weaknesses
### - Sampling technique.
While the whitening is well introduced into long-tailed classification in Secs.3.1-3.3, the sampling strategy (Sec.3.4) is presented in a heuristic manner without providing detailed (theoretical) analysis nor motivation.

It is unclear why classes are first divided into several groups (in Fig.4). The concept of "group" as a superset of classes is introduced in a procedural way, lacking discussion about its effect on sampling.

Then, ad-hoc sampling rule is defined by using lots of hyper-parameters in Eqs.(4,5). What is a key difference from the standard class-balanced sampling? For realizing such a class-aware sampling, it is more straightforward to control the class frequency in sampling between the uniform (class-balanced sampling) and the ratio of class samples (instance-balanced sampling), though it is hard to grasp the purpose of GRBS in this manuscript.

Besides, BET is just a simple technique to control frequency of the GRBS.
As shown in Table 4, the GRBS itself degrades performance, while it is improved by BET. Following this direction, class-balanced sampling (CB) could also be improved by applying such an ad-hoc control of sampling frequency.
Pile of these ad-hoc techniques makes the method theoretically unclear.

### - Feature analysis.
This paper lacks in-depth analysis about feature co-variance (Fig.2). Qualitative discussion/analysis is required to clarify why such a rank reduction happens in the scenario of class imbalance. SVD results in the bottom row of Fig.2 are less discussed; add more comments on it such as by clarifying what the two axes mean.
There are also several works to cope with class imbalance by means of feature co-variance [R1,R2] and normalization [R3][Zhong+21]. The authors should discuss the proposed method in those frameworks for clarifying its novelty.

Fig.3 provides a confusing analysis based on trace norm of covariance matrices. The right-hand figure shows that the proposed method increases "instability", possibly leading to unfavorable training.
It is a confusing result and makes it hard to understand the authors' claim. The trace norm is dependent on the feature scale (magnitude) which is less relevant to instability of training. Thus, it seems not to be a proper metric for measuring the instability in this case; the authors should apply the other metric invariant to feature scales.

### - Experimental results.
The performance results in Sec.4 are inferior to SOTAs reported, e.g., in [R3]. For fair comparison to the SOTAs, the method should be embedded into the popular backbone networks, e.g., ResNet-50 for ImageNet-LT and iNat18.
It is also valuable to check whether discriminative features of deeper backbones behaves in the similar way to Fig.2 or not.

In Fig.4 right, it is meaningless to compare training losses among different sampling strategies since even an identical training dataset can be regarded as different ones by varying sampling rules.

### Summary
This paper addresses the imbalance class problem using DNNs trained end-to-end. It firstly finds that he highly correlated features fed into the classifier is a main factor of the failure of end-to-end training DNNs on imbalanced classification tasks. It thus proposes Whitening-Net, which uses ZCA-based batch whitening to help end-to-end training escape from the degenerate solutions and further proposes two mechanisms to alleviated the potential batch statistic estimation problem of whitening in the class-imbalance situation. Experimental results on the benchmarks CIFAR-LT-10/100, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist-LT, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

### Strengths
+ This paper is a well-motivated paper and the solution is well-supported. This paper addresses the imbalance class problem using DNNs trained end-to-end, and empirically finding that the highly correlated features fed into the classifier makes the failure of end-to-end training on imbalanced classification. Based on this, it uses batch whitening (termed channel-whitening in this paper) to decorrelate the features before the last linear layer (classifier), and further proposes two mechanisms to alleviated the potential batch statistic estimation problem of whitening in the class-imbalance situation.

+ The imbalance classification problem is common in the learning and vision community, especially in the situation using DNNs. The main line of methods is decoupled training. It is glad to see the proposed end-to-end trained whitening-Net outperformed the decoupled training methods, showing great potentiality.   

+ The presentation of this paper is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1.The descriptions of this paper should follow the common specification. This paper uses the Batch whitening (whitening over the batch dimension, like its specification, batch normalization (standardization) ) [Huang CVPR 2018, Huang CVPR 2020], but it terms as channel whitening. I understand this paper want to address the “channel” decorrelation, but the method is commonly said as “batch” whitening (v.s., batch normalization).   

2.I am not confident to the novelty. Indeed, batch whitening is a general module proposed in [Huang CVPR 2018, Huang CVPR 2020], and is also plugged in before the last linear layer to learn decorrelated representation for normal class distribution. I recognize the novelty of this paper using BW for imbalance classification, but overall, the novelty seems not to be significant.  

Other minors:

-It is better to proofreading the paper. E.g., “re-samplingPouyanfar et al” in Page 2, “Aditya et al. Menon et al. (2020) propose” in Page 3. “Table ??, ” in Page 8. 

-I am not sure this paper whether use a correct reference, e.g., “. Cui et al. Cui et al. (2019)” “Cao et al. Cao et al. (2019) ” …., Besides, There provide too much reference in the first paragraph, and most of words in the first paragraph is the reference. I personally suggest only preserve the representative references in the first paragraph, and leave the others in the related work for details.

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of image classification and claims  two-fold contributions: first it identifies that in imbalanced problems high correlation between features is an indicator of poor performance and secondly it proposes a whitening algorithm to address the problem. The method is evaluated on 4 datasets.

### Strengths
1. The observation about correlation  is interesting and I believe it has applications beyond this paper
2. The algorithm proposed is explained clearly although innovation is limited
3. Evaluation is strong. I appreciated evaluation on a dataset which is naturally imbalanced as evaluation on synthetic sets have limitation in practice.

### Weaknesses
1. Some clarification in evaluation would be beneficial: It is not clear to me, given this form of the paper, if the improvement in the performance is on the frequent classes or the ones that have little representation. I believe that is a relevant question especially when focusing  on imbalance problems.
2. (Minor) Paper needs some revision:
    - page 8 "Table ??,"
    - what does "Many" "Medium" "Few" "All" refer to in table 3

### Summary
The paper addresses imbalanced image classification task with a Whitening-Net. Specifically, the authors first show that the reason of model degeneration lies on the correlation coefficients among sample features before the classifier, i.e., large correlated coefficients lead to model degeneration. Thereby, they proposes to use ZCA whitening before classifier to remove or decrease the correlated coefficients between different samples. For stable training, the also present the Group-based Relatively Balanced Sampler (GRBS) to obtain class-balanced samples, and a covariance-corrected module.

### Strengths
Good results on most of the datasets.

### Weaknesses
The novelty is limited. The so-called Whitening-Net is more like a batch normalization before the classifier. 

There are many works that use BN layer before classifier to address imbalanced image classification task. Some are as follows when searching in Google. Please clarify if there are similar or not, and provide some results by BN at least.
