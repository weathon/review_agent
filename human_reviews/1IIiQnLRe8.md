- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Semantic shift detection faces a big challenge of modeling non-semantic feature diversity while suppressing generalization to unseen semantic shifts. Existing reconstruction-based approaches are either not constrained well to avoid over-generalization or not general enough to model diversity-agnostic in-distribution samples. Both may lead to feature confusion near the decision boundary and fail to identify various semantic shifts. In this work, we propose Bi-directional Regularized Diversity Modulation (BiRDM) to model restricted feature diversity for semantic shift detection so as to address the challenging issues in reconstruction-based detection methods. BiDRM modulates feature diversity by controlling spatial transformation with learnable dynamic modulation parameters in latent space. Smoothness Regularization (SmoReg) is introduced to avoid undesired generalization to semantic shift samples. Furthermore, Batch Normalization Simulation (BNSim) coordinating with auxiliary data is leveraged to separately transform different semantic distributions and push potential semantic shift samples away implicitly, making the feature more discriminative. Compared with previous works, BiRDM can successfully model diversity-agnostic non-semantic pattern while alleviating feature confusion in latent space. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### Summary
The paper proposes a set of methods for semantic shift detection. A bidirectional module is proposed to model feature diversity and a regularization technique is proposed for undesired generalizability. Extensive experiments were provided to validate the performance of the method.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of the paper is well-grounded: Doing semantic shift detection via exploring non-semantic features. The relationships with previous works are also clarified properly.
2. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming other compared methods in a great margin.

### Weaknesses
Though the performance of the proposed framework is superior, I have the following concerns:
1. As illustrated in Figure 2, spatial transformation is done for diversity learning. I wonder how is this different from common data augmentation methods (rotate, flip, clip etc.). Also, how would the proposed BiRDM compare with directly adopting more complex data augmentation methods such as Mixup? Since data augmentation can also be seen as a way for preserving semantic information.
2. The framework is rather complex and requires much hyper-parameter tuning. Thus I have doubt on the applicability of the framework. 
3. Figure 1 shows that multiple intermediate features are used. Also BNSim requires auxiliary data. Does these make the proposed framework fair to compare with other baselines? In my view, the type and number of intermediate features should be aligned. Auxiliary data can be added, but more details should be presented (number, type, construction procedure etc.).

### Summary
The paper proposes a method called Bi-directional Regularized Diversity Modulation (BiRDM) for modeling restricted feature diversity in semantic shift detection. The method modulates feature diversity using learnable dynamic modulation parameters in latent space and introduces smoothness regularization and Batch Normalization Simulation (BNSim) to enhance discriminability and separate different semantic distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- The proposed method, BiRDM, introduces novel techniques such as dynamic modulation parameters, smoothness regularization, and BNSim to effectively model diversity-agnostic non-semantic patterns.
- The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The paper lacks a clear motivation for the problem of semantic shift detection and the importance of modeling diversity-agnostic non-semantic patterns.
- The paper could provide more details about the experimental setup, such as the hyperparameters used.

### Questions
- Can the proposed method handle different types of semantic shifts, or is it limited to specific patterns?
- How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the regularization weight and the number of modulation stages?

### Summary
To better detect semantic transfer based on reconstruction, this article proposes DMSSD, which mainly uses the newly proposed BiRDM in the architecture to perform modulation feature diversity. Also, modulation constraint, smoothness regularization, and BN simulation coordinating with auxiliary data have been proposed to detect semantic shifts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

### Strengths
+ The authors present a very detailed explanation of the modeling framework and a good description of the differences and comparisons between the present results.

+ The authors are more detailed in explaining the results of the experiments and are more complete about the experimental parameter settings making the results more convincing.

### Weaknesses
1. Contributions and novelties: The innovation of this article is limited. 
The proposed architecture is based on previous work ( Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection [1] ) and it is modified slightly with demodulation part, and both the framework design and the experimental procedure and phenomenon explanation heavily refer to the work in DMAD, rather than using more of their own The architecture is based on previous work and it is modified slightly with demodulation part.	
2. Discussions with previous work: The authors present less discussion of OOD-related work and fewer descriptions of the underlying theories and fundamental methods within the OOD field, making it difficult to highlight the contributions of their work.
3. Presentation issues: The authors had put many key elements of the article, such as Detailed implementation of BNSim and Large-scale dataset, in the appendix at the end of the article, which makes the article much less easy to read and more difficult to understand completely.
4. Experimental results. The experimental datasets, i.e., CIFAR 10 and FashionMNIST are somehow on a small scale and the performance seems to be saturated, taking Tab.2 B as an example. I suggest the authors conduct on some popular datasets including ImageNet. I understand there might be a computational issue, and the authors could choose other subsets of these real-world datasets. This would make the overall paper more convincing.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for semantic shift detection based on the reconstruction of discretized features. The overall idea is to better model the diversity, or fine-graininess of features. The starting method, used in previous works, is to obtain some feature vectors, then use a memory bank to quantize them, and then reconstruct the initial samples. High reconstruction errors signify OOD samples. The paper suggests some limitations to this framework and suggests solutions. 

Problem 1: all samples are hard to reconstruct due to memory quantization. Solution: proposed BiRDM: demodulate features, to make them simpler, less diverse and similar to memory features then modulate them back to gain back the diversity. This makes all samples easier to reconstruct. 

Problem 2: there seems to be a problem that fine-grained features are not smooth enough, and they can generate noisy modulation params, thus a smoothness constraint is proposed.

Problem 3: the features after ConvBN cannot discriminate between ID and OOD data. Although this is helpful for bad reconstruction of OOD data. Nevertheless, a model (BNSim) is proposed that can bypass the memory quantization and still discriminate between ID and OOD samples. This BNSim model is trained by reconstruction on auxiliary data. Then, its output can be compared to the memory quantized output, and the difference can be used as part of the semantic shift detection score.

### Strengths
- S1. Most proposed solutions are sound and can benefit semantic detection. The demodulation-modulation approach seems appropriate for avoiding the loss of fine-grained features in the quantization process.
- S2. The proposed method achieves good results compared to other baselines.

### Weaknesses
- W1. The paper is hard to read and the motivation is unclear many times. More details will follow.

- W2. The method is very complex, with a lot of components where some address the weaknesses but also affect the benefits of other components. The complexity together with the fine balance that the components need means that probably the method is hard to tune. 

- W2.2 For example, the memory quantization is used because OOD samples should be harder to quantize thus OOD samples are harder to reconstruct. But BiRDM makes *every* sample easier to reconstruct. There is a fine balance that these two components must achieve, and this could be potentially worrisome as the method could be hard to optimize. I am open to clarification in this regard.

- W3. It is not clear if the compared methods are also using additional data. Is this the case?

- W4. Table 1 mostly presents the results of previous methods in the current setting, as evaluated by the current paper. This can be problematic, as we don’t have a proper comparison to the results as presented in previous work. Hyperparameter tuning and model selection can influence the results to a high degree. The same amount of compute should be invested into hyperparameter tunning/model selection of all methods. Was this the case? 

- W5. There are some missing details: such kind of data is used as auxiliary data, what is the exact architecture of the multiple modulation stages, and what is the connection to reverse distillation (Deng & Li, 2022)?
 
- W6. There are some unclear statements and motivations, as follows:

- W6.1 Referring to smoothness constraint: “In this way, potentially high (low) reconstruction error for IDs (OODs) can be alleviated.” It makes sense that the smoothness constraint will alleviate high reconstruction errors for *all* samples. It is not clear why it can alleviate high errors only for ID samples but not for OOD samples. Could the authors explain this?

- W6.2 “SmoReg firstly projects diversity feature $z_{diver}$ to a D-dimension bounded diversity representation space by orthogonal matrix P to capture more compact non-semantic factors”. How do we know that this space captures non-semantic factors but it does not capture semantic factors? Is there any constraint to this effect? 

- W6.3 “minimizing $L_{smo}$ with aid of enough sampled \$tilde{z}_{proj}$ (as explained in App. C) ensures smooth non-semantic diversity modeling”. Again, what makes this reflect only the non-semantic diversity, but not the semantic diversity?

- W6.4 “SmoReg targets at smoothing the unoccupied regions in diversity representation space to suppress semantic shifts without affecting the real reconstruction of IDs”. What constraint makes it suppress semantic shifts? Seems like the smoothness constraint would help all kind of diversity (semantic or not) to be better kept in the features. It is not clear how to act differently on semantic vs non-semantic features.

- W6.5 “BN may incorrectly adapt OODs to training distribution with global affine transformation and decrease the feature discriminability”. Why is this a problem, if the BN adapts OOD samples to ID distribution, then the reconstruction error should be high, thus it would be easy to detect the OOD samples. 


- W6.6 The difference $z_{proto}^{sim} - z_{proto}^{comp}$ between BNSim features ($z_{proto}^{sim}$) and memory quantization features ($z_{proto}^{comp}$) is used as OOD detection score. This assumes that ID samples do not have high quantization error while OOD samples have high quantization error when compared to BNSim features. There seems to be a contradiction here: The authors note that the convBN cannot discriminate between ID and OOD samples but the proposed score only works if the convBN features are quantized differently (such that ID samples result in quantized features with low error compared to BNSim features, and OOD samples result in quantized features with high error compared to BNSim features). Can the authors explain this apparent contradiction?

### Summary
This paper target at out of distribution detection, specifically focus on the semantic shift. It claims that there is a trade-off between non-semantic in-distribution diversity and over generalization to out-of-distribution semantic shift. The paper lies in the scope of reconstruction-based error detection, and adopts a method that disentangle the representations of non-semantic diversity and the semantic prototypes from input features. Benefit from the non-semantic diversity modeling, the proposed method learns compact prototypical features. Authors conduct experiments on two benchmarks, with suppressing results to existing works.

### Strengths
(1)	The authors proposed a new technique, that is to demodulate the original input features to remove non-semantic diversity, and thus the model can learn compact semantic prototypes which is helpful for detecting out-of-distribution semantic shift. The demodulation is combined with a modulation layer to better reconstruct the input. The overall technique make sense.  
(2)	The experiments on CIFAR10 show good improvements to existing methods.

### Weaknesses
(1) The presentation needs improvment. There are some unsupported claims. For example, the author claims that there is a trade-off between non-semantic in-distribution diversity and over generalization to out-of-distribution semantic shift, however, as suggested in DMAD[3], the in-distribution diversity is mainly related to covariate shift. Intuitively, to better detect the OOD semantic shift is to learn compact and discriminative prototypical features. The claimed motivation should be doubted according to this. 
(2) The experiments are not convincing, too. The paper only shows improvements on CIFAR10, and on FashionMNIST, authors claimed that it only contains image-level geometrical diversity which is also not supported (i.e., how to measure the claimed “image-level” or “feature-level” diversity of a dataset?). The benchmarks used in [1] and [14] should also be considered. What’s more, the ablation experiments are only conducted on a specific class of CIFAR10, why the class is representative? It is important to show the overall-class performance, especially for Table 2.
