- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Efficiently aggregating trained neural networks from local clients into a global model on a server is a widely researched topic in federated learning. Recently, motivated by diminishing privacy concerns, mitigating potential attacks, and reducing the overhead of communication, one-shot federated learning (i.e., limiting client-server communication into a single round) has gained popularity among researchers. However, the one-shot aggregation performances are sensitively affected by the non-identical training data distribution, which exhibits high statistical heterogeneity in some real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel one-shot aggregation method with Layer-wise Posterior Aggregation, named FedLPA. FedLPA aggregates local models to obtain a more accurate global model without requiring extra auxiliary datasets or exposing any confidential local information, e.g., label distributions. To effectively capture the statistics
maintained in the biased local datasets in the practical non-IID scenario, we efficiently infer the posteriors of each layer in each local model using layer-wise Laplace approximation and aggregate them to train the global parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedLPA significantly improves learning performance over state-of-the-art methods across several metrics.

### Summary
This work proposes a one-shot FL method through using approximated local posteriors of heterogeneous clients. The key idea is to use empirical Fisher to approximate the local inverse covariance (which is utilized in the final aggregation). By using local statistics authors are able to do the aggregation step while taking the heterogeneity of the clients into account.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is sound, the way the authors want to utilize the local covariance's and use empirical Fisher for approximation is a good idea to employ in heterogeneous settings. 
- In the reported experiments the method significantly outperforms competing methods. 
- The first 2 sections are well-written and motivates the work decently.

### Weaknesses
- One of the major weaknesses is the way the methodology is presented. In Section 3 various subsections are sequentially presented; but the subsections are not connected well, it is hard to follow the sequence of methodology through text. The algorithm should be put into main text, and well connected to the sections. I would suggest rewriting the algorithm in more details and possibly adding a figure as an overview.  
- The authors call their method 'personalized'. In personalized FL the inference is made through individual models of the clients. But, as far as I understand, the output of your methodology is a single global model that would hopefully work for every client; although you obtain local posteriors they are just intermediators for the global model training. If this is the case, this is not a personalized method but a heterogeneous FL method. Otherwise, please clarify. 
- I think the current experiments are not enough to show the efficacy of the method. In particular, majority of the experiments are done with 20 clients, which is small for the FL. Also, there is no comparison to local only training. 
- More experiments with higher number of clients should be added to text if possible. Also the performance change w.r.t number of clients and data samples should be reported. 
- Lack of experiments on synthetically generated data is not desirable for such a statistically motivated method.

### Questions
- In section 3.5 is there a specific reason to introduced the l2 squared loss other than available optimization tools?
- See above for other points.

### Summary
This paper introduces a one-shot federated learning approach under a Bayesian framework. This approach solves the communication burden in transmitting the Hessian of log posterior by approximating it with the empirical Fisher information matrix and further approximating the empirical Fisher into layer-wise block-diagonal matrix by assuming layer independence. The layer-wise block-diagonal matrix is then decomposed into smaller factor matrices with Kronecker-factored approximation. These approximation methods combined greatly saved the communication cost than naively transmitting the full matrix. The author considered a thorough list of baselines to compare and showed that the proposed FedLPA outperformed those methods in a one-shot setting.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written with methods clearly explained despite its complexity. 
- The proposed method is novel and technically solid. The different approximation steps are driven with empirical constraints in Federated learning. Though most of the linear algebra tricks are based on existing works, they are applied in an innovative way to solve the focused one-short FL problem.
- The empirical evaluation is thorough with multiple baseline methods implemented and compared in different heterogeneous settings. The results in the one-shot setting demonstrates that the proposed methods are promising.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method is composed of multiple approximations: 1) empirical fisher to approximate the Hessian 2) block-diagonal Fisher matrix instead of full, 3) approximating global model parameter $\bar{M}$ with optimization problem in Equation 14. However, there is no ablation to understand how each approximation step impacts the final results. 
- FedLPA requires transmitting individual (instead of aggregation) $A_k, B_k, M_k$ in order to solve the optimization problem in Equation 14. Exposing individual statistics to the server can have privacy concerns and cannot be compatible with standard secure aggregation protocol or central differential privacy methods.

### Questions
- Why are multi-round results of FedLPA worse than the alternatives as shown in Figure 2?
- Consider a large model where one single layer weight can be enormous, how would one further decompose its Fisher information for communication efficiency?

### Summary
The paper proposes FedLPA, a method for one-round aggregation in federated learning. Motivated by a posterior inference view of FL, FedLPA proposes to use the (Kronecker-factored) Fisher information of the local models at clients for aggregation. Given clients send their local Fisher information, the server then optimizes a quadratic objective to get the weights of the global model. Experiments are conducted on MNIST, FMNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 to demonstrate the improvement offered by FedLPA across various settings of heterogeneity along with other ablation studies.

### Strengths
Experimental results show that the proposed FedLPA can outperform vanilla averaging (FedAvg) and distillation-style based aggregation (DENSE) across a range of standard datasets, especially when the data heterogeneity is high. Also while FedLPA does increase overall computation as shown in Table 4, it is still much less than DENSE.

### Weaknesses
**1. Writing.** There are numerous writing issues throughout the paper. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect, have incorrect punctuation and/or simply don't make sense. Some words are incorrectly capitalized or not capitalized when they should be.  I am highlighting a few such cases below. 

* Page 1: "With the primary objectives of safeguarding data privacy and curbing the aggregation and management of data across institutions, the distribution of data exhibits variations among clients" -> The text before and after the comma are completely disconnected.

* "Fedavg" should be FedAvg everywhere in the paper

* Page 2: "Layer-wise" -> layer-wise

* Page 2: "Fisher information matrices as a metric of the parameter space" -> Metric to measure what? How is the parameter space defined?

* Page 2: " multi-variates linear objective function and using its quadratic form" -> I don't understand what the authors mean by quadratic form of a linear objective 

* Page 2: "Nevertheless, from the theoretical analysis, we show that FedLPA has a linear convergence rate" -> Why is there a nevertheless here? Given that the objective is quadratic, gradient descent should have a linear convergence rate.

* Page 4: "globally variational inference using Eq. 2" -> "global variational inference using Eq. 2"

* Page 4: "uploads probability parameters to the server" -> What are probability parameters?

* Page 5: " Modern algorithms (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Martens & Grosse, 2015a) allow the local training process to obtain an optimal, regarded as the expectation $\mu_k$ in the above equations"-> This is completely grammatically incorrect. Please fix this sentence.

* Page 5: "it is an approximate of the Fisher information matrix" -> " it is an approximation of the Fisher information matrix"

* Page 5: computing all co-relations is impossible, which are inaccurate" ->  Text before and after the comma is disconnected.



**2. Mathematical definitions are not precise.** To add to the writing issues, in many places the mathematical notation/assumptions are not properly defined. Some examples are given below
* The second proportionality in Eq. (2) holds only under the flat prior assumption, i.e. $p(\theta) \sim 1$. The authors have not stated this clearly. 
* In the line with the definition of Kronecker product (just below Eq. (10)), the authors are missing an expectation in the definition of $A_{kl}$ and $B_{kl}$.
* Section 3.5: What is $\bar{\Sigma}$ and $\bar{z}$ ? In Section 3.4, the authors have just defined $\bar{\Sigma}_l$ and $\bar{z}_l$ for a layer $l$. 
* Section 3.5: "optimal solution of $\bar{\mu}$" -> "optimal solution of $f(\bar{\mu})$". Optimal solution of a vector does not make sense.
* Section 3.5: "As we have $\mu = \bar{\Sigma}\cdot \bar{z}$"- > the authors already defined $\bar{\mu} = vec(\bar{M})$ earlier in the same line. I'm not sure what re-definition is doing. 


**3. No connection with personalization.** The title of the paper states "Personalized One Shot Federated Learning". The authors also write about the benefits of personalization in paragraph 4 of the Introduction section. However, the rest of the paper just focuses on the server learning a single global model. I don't understand what is the connection with personalization here. 

**4. Limited novelty, missing references, privacy concerns.** The idea of formulating FL as a posterior inference problem is already well-known (Al Shedivat et al. 2020) and the idea of approximating the Hessian as the Fisher is also standard  (Ritter et al. 2018). Moreover, the resulting concept of using the Fisher information to aggregate models has already been well-explored in previous work [1], which the authors have not cited. The only difference here is that FedLPA proposes to use the K-FAC while [1] uses the diagonal Fisher. However, I feel this is not significant enough novelty. Moreover, implementing the K-FAC requires clients to send $A_k, B_k, M_k$ matrices which increases communication compared to just the diagonal Fisher. The authors also claim without any justification that $A_k,B_k, M_k$ preserve the data/label privacy.  This claim has to be supported by empirical evidence/theory in order for it to be justified.



**5. Weak baselines and easy datasets.** Among the baselines, I understand the comparison with FedAvg to show improvement over simple averaging. However SCAFFOLD, FedNova and FedProx are not good one-shot baselines. These methods are primarily designed for multi-round FL and therefore I am not surprised to see that their performance is similar to FedAvg in the experiments. DENSE is the only one-shot basline which can be considered competitive. The authors have cited other one-shot algorithms like FedOV and FedCAVE but have not compared to them based on the argument that they entail sharing more client side information. However, I think it fair to compare with these algorithms since FedLPA also requires clients to share and $A_k$ and $B_k$ matrices. 

FedLPA seems to outperform baselines significantly only for easier datasets such as FMNIST, MNIST and SVHN. For CIFAR-10 (which can be considered as the hardest dataset), the improvement over DENSE seems to reduce. Therefore I was interested in seeing the performance of FedLPA for even harder datasets such CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet as done in the DENSE paper. In addition, the paper would be significantly strengthened if the authors considered more realistic FL datasets such as EMNIST and Shakespeare [2].

### Questions
Please see my comments in Weakness 1 and 2 to improve the writing of the paper and suggestions for more experiments in Weakness 5. In addition, I was curious to know why the computation cost of Fedprox is higher than FedAvg and FedNova in Table 4.

### Summary
This paper aims to improve one-shot federated learning where the clients and the server are allowed to communicate only once. Instead of gradients, the authors propose FedLPA that computes the local posteriors in a layer-wise manner and aggregates them to form the global posterior, which is later used to update the global model. To this end, the authors approximate the posteriors with Laplacian approximation and empirical fisher matrices. An additional approximation with a multi-variate linear objective is proposed to estimate the global parameters and avoid the potential bias of Fisher matrices induced by the independence assumption that prior works have. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance over classical federated optimization and a one-shot FL baseline in various data skewness settings.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem targeted in this work is meaningful.

2. The idea is interesting and seems novel. Instead of noisy gradient accumulation, the proposed method considers a layer-wise aggregation that may reduce interference and provide a clearer supervision signal for the global model. The additional approximation is also interesting, though lacking a proper comparison and analysis.

3. The proposed method empirically performs well in many settings despite the limited amount of baselines and architectures.

### Weaknesses
1. My biggest concern is privacy risks. I doubt that communicating pre- and activations is more vulnerable to attacks, such as membership inference [1] or reconstruction attacks [2], as it contains more precise information in a layer-wise manner. For example, it is known that due to the sparsity of ReLU functions, gradient inversion attacks are less efficient in a large-batch case. However, the proposed method reveals both pre and after-activation values and may open up new attack possibilities. I am not saying the authors must solve the issue in this work, but I urge the authors to discuss the potential risks that the proposed method may introduce and solutions, e.g., differential privacy.

2. Despite the impressive numbers, the experiment settings seem limited. The author only considers a simple CNN network and a baseline tailored for one-shot federated learning.

2. Can the proposed method scale up to more complex networks, such as ResNet or U-net?

### Summary
The paper studies personalized one-shot federated learning (FL) where final global model is constructed through a one-shot update from the clients' local models. Since heterogeneous data makes one-shot FL challenging, the authors propose a Layer-wise Posterior Aggregation strategy called FedLPA. One of the main motivations behind this strategy is to improve the performance under non-iid data distribution and avoid leaking clients' sensitive data such as the label distribution.

### Strengths
The proposed approach, FedLPA, based on layer-wise posteriors does not increase the computational cost due to the block-diagonality assumption in the empirical Fisher information matrix. Empirically, FedLPA seems to outperform the baselines consistently and significantly.

### Weaknesses
The paper claims several times that FedLPA prevents additional leakage of user data at the one-shot step. Specifically, the claim is that the server only receives A, B, and M without any auxiliary information -- which should preserve the data/label privacy for the clients. However, A, B, and M do carry information about the client data since A and B are found from the empirical Fisher information matrix which is a function of the dataset and the locally trained model. So, if I am not missing something, A, B, and M are already a function of both the data and the labels. Then, how is this claim about privacy valid?

### Questions
Can you please clarify what the authors mean by this sentence (and similar ones in the paper) "The transmitted data between the clients and the server is solely $A_k$, $B_k$, $M_k$ without any extra auxiliary information, which preserves the data/label
privacy for the local clients."? Given that  $A_k$, $B_k$, $M_k$ are found via data-dependent empirical Fisher information matrix, how does FedLPA preserve data/label privacy?
