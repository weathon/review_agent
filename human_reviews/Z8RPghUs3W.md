- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Recovering underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures from observational data presents a formidable challenge due to the combinatorial nature of the DAG-constrained optimization problem. Recently, researchers have identified gradient vanishing as one of the primary obstacles in differentiable DAG learning and have proposed several DAG constraints to mitigate this issue. By developing the necessary theory to establish a connection between analytic functions and DAG constraints, we demonstrate that analytic functions from the set $\\{f(x) = c_0 + \sum_{i=1}c_ix^i|c_0 \geqslant 0; \forall i > 0, c_i > 0; r = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}c_{i}/c_{i+1} > 0\\}$ can be employed to formulate effective DAG constraints.
Furthermore, we establish that this set of functions is closed under several functional operators, including differentiation, summation, and multiplication. Consequently, these operators can be leveraged to create novel DAG constraints based on existing ones.
Additionally, we emphasize the significance of the convergence radius $r$ of an analytic function as a critical performance indicator. An infinite convergence radius is susceptible to gradient vanishing but less affected by nonconvexity. Conversely, a finite convergence radius aids in mitigating the gradient vanishing issue but may be more susceptible to nonconvexity. This property can be instrumental in selecting appropriate DAG constraints for various scenarios.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel class of analytic functions, establishing that any element within this class can be utilized to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) constraint. This family of functions demonstrates closure properties with respect to addition, multiplication, and differentiation. The author employs the properties of analytic function to explore the relationship between the phenomena of vanishing gradients and the convergence radius. On the empirical front, the author conducted two synthetic experiments to evaluate the performance of various DAG constraints. The findings highlight that the DAG constraint depends on the prior knowledge of data scale.

### Strengths
The paper presents a framework that integrates existing DAG constraints within the realm of analytic functions, employing the convergence radius as a analytical tool to investigate its relationship with the phenomenon of vanishing gradients. Upon a preliminary examination of the derivations, they appear to be sound and well-founded. While previous works have engaged in similar formulations to the proposed framework, the paper distinguishes itself through the analytic functions. The logical flow of the paper is commendable, facilitating ease of comprehension, although it is noted that there are certain aspects that remain ambiguous and warrant further clarification. Given the pivotal role of DAG constraints in the domain of structure learning, this work is poised to make a meaningful contribution.

### Weaknesses
There are two concerns about this paper. Firstly, the author mainly studied the effect of different DAG constraints with linear functional relationships. However, I wonder if those observations can be transferred to non-linear settings as well, where instead of using a weighted matrix $B$, one can directly apply the constraint on binary adjacency matrix, see [1]. Since non-linear behavior is ubiquitous in real world, the analysis on non-linear setting can further improve the contribution of this paper. Secondly, there are some ambiguities that requires further clarifications.

### Questions
1. In the paper, "dataset scale" is an important concept but this has not bee properly introduced, what is the dataset scale and what do you mean be "dataset scale is known"? Do you provide extra information during model training?

2. For the DAG constraints, it seems that we only need summation order to be $d$ to specify a DAG. What are the advantages of going to $\infty$? Is it because $\infty$ order allows the series to converge to a particular function so that it is easy to compute the gradient?

3. In proposition, the $-n$ is for $(I-\tilde{B})$ or $tr(I-\tilde{B}))$? This can be quite misleading. For the previous discussion, I assume it is for $(I-\tilde{B})$?

4. Figure 1 is very helpful for the reader to understand the property of different DAG constraints. But the description of how figure 1 is generated is too vague, I think it would be helpful if the author can provide more details.

5. For "Choosing DAG constraints for different scenarios", I did not follow the arguments made in that section. For example, why with known data scale, the objective can provide a larger gradient? Also, if we have a large constraints, it will still create many local optima even with a informative objective function, right? So the correct argument is to achieve an appropriate balance between objective and constraints?

6. In experiment section, what is $\otimes$? Is it Kronecker product? Why do you use this instead of $\odot$?

7. For the experiment 4.1 and 4.2, why the dimensionality differs by a lot? For 4.1, the dimensionality starts at 200 but in 4.2, the highest is 50. I also want to see the performance of PC with known true data scale.

### Summary
The authors propose an interesting framework that unifies previously proposed DAG constraints and proposes new ones. They also study constraints that differently from the popular one from NOTEARS mitigate the vanishing gradient (VG) problem. The main story is around the convergence radius of the analytic functions defining the constraints: a finite one mitigates VG but exacerbates nonconvexity, and with infinite radius it becomes viceversa.

### Strengths
- Interesting unifying framework for existing constraints
- Some guidelines provided for how to choose constraints in practice, for the case of linear SEMs with additive noise, equal variances

### Weaknesses
- First, the paper is overflowing the 9 pages limit ? 
- What is the effect of the multiplication introduced in Eq 14 to get positivity ? This looks a bit hacky and wasn't done in previous related works ?
- The part "Choosing DAG constraints for different scenarios" is a bit too informal. Can you expand  the arguments more formally (if no space, at least in the appendix) ?

### Questions
No further questions beyond those in "weaknesses"

### Summary
The authors study a class of analytic functions that can be used as differentiable DAG constraints. They characterize the properties of the function class and show that it remains closed under various operations. They compare and contrast many existing DAG constraints with the analytic functions under the proposed class. They also study the tradeoff between the gradient vanishing and nonconvexity of the proposed constraints.

### Strengths
The paper presents a sound theoretical analysis of an analytic function class that can be used as differentiable DAG constraints. They also shed light on the gradient-vanishing issue encountered by the existing constraint-based methods such as [Bello et al., 2022] and [Zhang et al., 2022]. They propose a workaround albeit with a possibility of making the problem more nonconvex. The paper is well written and presented and the authors convey their ideas well.

### Weaknesses
The authors do well in comparing and contrasting their ideas with [Bello et al., 2022] and [Zhang et al., 2022]. Their observation is novel and provides an insight into the existing results, however, it seems like a natural extension. The numerical experiments with constraint-based methods do not suggest any major performance improvement over the existing methods (considering both shd and rtime). Furthermore, comparison with score-based methods also fails to show any major performance improvement.

### Questions
While I understand the intuitive tradeoff between the nonconvexity of the problem and the gradient-vanishing phenomena, is it possible to quantify such intuition? In my opinion, such a quantification would certainly improve the quality of the contributions. What is the mathematical meaning of more or less nonconvex and how does it relate to the DAG recovery in a formal way?

### Summary
The paper provides a generalized framework for differentiable DAG learning (with observational data) with "DAGness" constraints, introducing a class of analytic functions that may act as DAG constraints and proving various properties and of such functions. In particular, the paper generalises a stream of recent works that includes NOTEARS, DAGMA and  TMPI. 
Specific DAG constraints can be then derived picking functions in the identified class. The author suggest that the main factor of variation in terms of behavior of the resulting algorithm is determined by the radius of convergence $r$ of the analytic function: the two macro-classes being functions with finite and infinite $r$. The authors then suggest that there is a tradeoff between non-convexity (and potentially many local minimia) and gradient vanishing problems. The paper focuses on structural linear equation models.

**Important note:** the paper exceeds the 9 page limit and the final sections seem quite rushed to me. I reviewed the paper regardless of this, but must flag this issue as it may be unfair for other authors.

### Strengths
- I believe this is a solid contribution, in terms of results and clarity of exposition to the sub-class of methods for constraint-based DAG learning and linear SEMs: the suggested framework and results clearly subsume recent work in the area and can potentially constitute a solid ground for follow up research. 
- The quality of the theoretical part of the paper is high: propositions and theorems are clearly stated and proofs are clear and easy to follow
- Notation is mostly well designed and background is sufficiently broad to make the paper self-contained for readers that have some knowledge in the field of DAG learning

### Weaknesses
- The clarity of the paper degrades after page 6. The final paragraph of the experimental section and the conclusions are rushed and need revision. Given that the rest of the paper is mostly clear and well written, this alone wouldn't be too much of a problem for me. However,  the paper also exceeds the 9 pages, and I think there is some potential for "unfair" comparison with other authors who spent time making sure to respect the 9 page limit (and polishing the entire submission). 
- The weakest part of the work is in my opinion the connection between the convergence radius of the series and the trade-off vanishing gradient / non-convexity. I think the authors should elaborate more on this, especially for the part regarding the gradient vanishing.  
-  I also had some difficulties following the discussion of the known-vs-unknown scale and how this relate to the convergence radius. The authors could elaborate more on it and also provide some (analytical) justifications that goes beyond intuitive arguments. 
- The experiments only pertain synthetic data and do no report any comparison with score-based non-relaxed/discrete methods, see e.g. [1, 2, 3]

Minor comments/typos [excluding last sections, which need to be thoroughly revised]:
- Please define SEM the first time you introduce the acronym
- pag 3. An interesting property [of] the ....
- Check first sentence of sec 3.2
- pag 5, (probably typo) what's $b$ in $||Bb||_1$? 
- Eq 16 shouldn't it be $B\circ B$ in the Frobenius norm?
- Is the term "invex" appropriate for describing the analytical constraints? Or maybe Fig 1 is misleading, as invex funcitons have stationary point $\implies$ global minimum.
- Probably would be more useful to show normalized SHD to account for growing DAG size. 
- What's $\otimes$ on pag. 7?
- Please formulate an objective, or at least write down the score function for the modified problem at pag 9.
- Missing tr[...] of second line of Eq (22)?
