## Abstract
Modern techniques like contrastive learning have been effectively used in many areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, and graph-structured data. Creating positive examples that assist the model in learning robust and discriminative representations is a crucial stage in contrastive learning approaches. Usually, preset human intuition directs the selection of relevant data augmentations. Due to patterns that are easily recognized by humans, this rule of thumb works well in the vision and language domains. However, it is impractical to visually inspect the temporal structures in time series. The diversity of time series augmentations at both the dataset and instance levels makes it difficult to choose meaningful augmentations on the fly. Thus, although prevalent, contrastive learning with data augmentation has been less studied in the time series domain. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing time series data augmentation using information theory and summarizing the most commonly adopted augmentations in a unified format. We then propose a parametric augmentation method, AutoTCL, which can be adaptively employed to support time series representation learning. The proposed approach is encoder-agnostic, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated with different backbone encoders. Experiments on univariate forecasting tasks demonstrate the highly competitive results of our method, with an average 6.5\%  reduction in MSE and  4.7\% in MAE over the leading baselines. In classification tasks, AutoTCL achieves a $1.2\%$ increase in average accuracy.

### Summary
The study addresses the challenge of data augmentation in time series contrastive learning, where traditional human-guided augmentations might not be directly applicable. The authors analyze time series data augmentation using an information theory perspective and introduce a new parametric augmentation method, named AutoTCL. This method adaptively creates augmentations for time series contrastive learning without relying on pre-defined knowledge. The proposed approach is encoder-independent, making it compatible with various backbone encoders. Experimental results indicate that AutoTCL outperforms leading baselines in both univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks, as well as in classification tasks.

### Strengths
S1. A Well-Written Paper: the motivation, method, and experiments are illustrated clearly,

S2. Novel Approach: The introduction of AutoTCL, a parametric augmentation method, offers an adaptive solution to time series contrastive learning, filling a significant gap in existing research.

S3. Novel and Automatic Augmentation Learning: Unlike traditional methods that rely on human intuition or domain knowledge, AutoTCL can automatically learn effective augmentations for time series data, reducing the need for manual tuning or trial-and-error approaches.

S4. Theoretical Foundation: The paper analyzes time series data augmentation from an information theory perspective, providing a good theoretical underpinning for its methodology.

### Weaknesses
W1. Support of Experiments:
My main concern is that the authors of this paper claim AutoTCL is a general augmentation method. While the method has been empirically proven effective in crossing different datasets, it would be very critical to test the methods on other contrastive learning frameworks.


W2. Discussion of Related Work:
The authors have given sufficient discussion about augmentation techniques in the original data space. Recently, another branch of augmentations has stemmed from the feature space. I'd also suggested authors to discussion them for a more comprehensive review. [1,2,3]

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes a parametric augmentation method to automate the selection of augmentations in contrastive time-series representation learning. The method is evaluated on multiple datasets for the tasks of forecasting and classification.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important topic in contrastive self-supervised learning: automating the selection of augmentations.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with the paper is that similar techniques were proposed earlier, such as Rommel et al., 2022. However, the paper does not provide any explanation beyond merely mentioning it in the related work section. It fails to clarify why the proposed method is different, necessary, or how it compares against Rommel et al., 2022. Additionally, there is no baseline for when augmentations are selected at random, for example, using RandAugment. Several other important prior works are missing as well, such as transformation prediction in HAR.

### Questions
Why is the evaluation for time-series classification limited to the UEA dataset? There are several other datasets available that cover modalities like EEG, ECG, and IMU. This choice is not very convincing. 

Also, considering the success of masked autoencoders that do not require anchor/positive generation, what is the usefulness of such an approach? In most cases, the performance is close to that of InfoTS, and further hyperparameter tuning of InfoTS is likely to bridge the performance gap. I see very limited utility of the proposed method.

There is no silver bullet, so what are the limitations of the proposed method? The paper also mentions the incorporation of frequency domain augmentations as future work, but this has already been extensively explored in the literature.

### Summary
The study employs a parametric neural network to decompose time series into two components: the informative segment and the task-irrelevant segment. Through a data-driven approach, the method adaptively transforms input instances by generating masks to produce viable positive samples, ultimately enhancing the unsupervised performance in time series analysis.

### Strengths
1. The study is well-grounded in theory concerning its motivation and summarizes the theoretical conditions that the " GOOD VIEWS" of contrastive learning should meet.

2. The proposed method exhibits outstanding performance in experimental results.

### Weaknesses
The paper emphasizes the use of a parametric module to decompose time series into an informative part and a task-irrelevant part and perform parameter transformation on the informative part to obtain an enhanced view. However, it is not sufficiently clear. 

1. What role does g play specifically? Especially in the analysis of the ablation experiments, I only observed differences in the results; 

2. It's ambiguous why h is able to focus on the informative part of the sequence. The author should provide several case studies to prove that h can indeed play a role in separating the information part and noise part of the time series. 

3. The two networks h and g use the same structure. How to ensure that they indeed perform the two different functions claimed by the author?

4. How is Δv set in the experiments?

5. The paper does not verify whether the positive view generated by the proposed method contains more information than the original sequence. Although the paper showcases the augmented instances through visualization in Figure 5, as the authors mentioned in the abstract, "it is impractical to visually inspect the temporal structures in time series." Providing explanations for the generated positive samples based on Property 3 or other relevant data would be beneficial.

6. From the visualization in Figure 5, it appears that the output mask of g is a binary mask, which does not match the description in the article. The article interprets g as a non-zero transformation mask. If the output of g is also a binary mask, does it mean that the optimal transformation method for sample enhancement that the model learns is simply to mask some observations of the original sequence?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduced a comprehensive augmentation framework for contrastive self-supervised learning. The framework effectively tackles the challenge of time series data augmentation by leveraging principles from information theory. Additionally, the authors conducted experiments to validate the performance of the proposed framework.

### Strengths
- The proposed approach effectively deals with the data augmentation problem by unifying various methods into a comprehensive framework through the utilization of information theory.
- Not only has the effectiveness of the framework been theoretically proven from an information theory perspective, but it has also been extensively validated through empirical experiments.

### Weaknesses
- There might be some minor inconsistencies or gaps in the proof that require further attention to ensure its rigor. Such as, in the proof of Property 1. An invertible mapping is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping, which depending on the domain. Of course, this does not affect the subsequent proof.
- Some errors on formatting：page 6 “as random timestamp masking“, it seems unnecessary to bold it.
- Font size of some tables is too low.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper starts by making the following observation: time series data is complex, high-dimensional, and harder to label than images or languages.
Deep learning requires lots of labeled data, but self-supervised learning offers a way to learn from unlabeled data. Applying general augmentation to diverse time series data is challenging; specific augmentations guided by domain knowledge are often needed.

Contributions:
- The paper introduces a factorization-based framework, AutoTCL, for adaptive data augmentation in time series contrastive learning. AutoTCL uses a neural network to factorize time series instances, preserving semantics, and optimizing against a contrastive loss.
- Empirical studies show the method outperforms benchmarks.

### Strengths
The paper has the following strenghts:
- It is clear, the writing is good.
- The empirical analysis seems sound. From table 4, there are benefits to the approach compared to relevant baselines and ablated versions of the model.
- The idea is proposed in a principled, justified way.

### Weaknesses
The paper's weaknesses are:
- Tables 6 and 7 along with the tables from the main paper seem to showcase marginal improvements over CoST, which was the architectural basis of their approach. In particular it is hard to determine if the difference is statistically significant.

- Most of the comparison in table 6/7 is less relevant than the ablation study. The reason is the following: the authors are comparing different architectures. Most of these perform less well than CoST, and they are building on top of CoST. Hence these results are quite expected and should in my opinion not be presented first.

- The authors propose a new augmentation scheme but focus only on CoST to showcase the performance of their approach. This means it is hard to determine whether their technique's benefits generalize to other settings.

- Many of the comparisons hinge on the average of performance on other datasets. However I have some concerns about Lora values being strongly different from other approaches (my 3rd question in the next section). This and the unweighted average of results could bias the conclusions somewhat.

### Questions
- Could the authors please provide experimental results on the other usual datasets, Illness / Exchange rate / Traffic? 

- Could the authors please provide error bars/statistical tests for at least a subset of the experiments in tables 6/7? It is difficult to estimate whether the findings are statistically significant.

- In table 4, Lora is the only dataset for which CoST results from prior tables diverge strongly from w/o Aug. We would expect those two results to be quite close. Could the authors expand upon that point?
