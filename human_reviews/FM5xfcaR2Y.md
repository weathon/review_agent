## Abstract
We consider a binary classification problem under group fairness constraints, which can be one of Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Opportunity (EOp), or Equalized Odds (EO). We propose an explicit characterization of Bayes optimal classifier under the fairness constraints, which turns out to be a simple modification rule of the unconstrained classifier. Namely, we introduce a novel instance-level measure of bias, which we call bias score, and the modification rule is a simple linear rule on top of the finite amount of bias scores. Based on this characterization, we develop a post-hoc approach that allows us to adapt to fairness constraints while maintaining high accuracy. In the case of DP and EOp constraints, the modification rule is thresholding a single bias score, while in the case of EO constraints we are required to fit a linear modification rule with 2 parameters. The method can also be applied for composite group-fairness criteria, such as ones involving several sensitive attributes. We achieve competitive or better performance compared to both in-processing and post-processing methods across three datasets: Adult, COMPAS, and CelebA. Unlike most post-processing methods, we do not require access to sensitive attributes during the inference time.

### Summary
This paper proposes a post-processing method for achieving fairness on binary classification problems, which leverages a representation result for the Bayes optimal fair classifier as a (linear) function of the bias scores, which are given by a function of several conditional probabilities.  The results cover the fairness criteria of DP, EO and EOp, can handle multiple sensitive attributes, and most notably, is applicable to the attribute-unaware setting (i.e., sensitive attribute is not observed during inference).

---

Post-rebuttal: I have increased my score, although I feel the assumptions for theorem 2 are unnecessarily strong/complicated.

### Strengths
- As mentioned in the summary, the results are general in that they cover DP, EO and EOp, can handle multiple sensitive attributes, and most notably, is applicable to the attribute-unaware setting (i.e., sensitive attribute is not observed during inference).
- The framework is flexible in allowing for composite criteria.
- The authors provides some qualitative interpretation of the representation result (theorem 1), namely the bias score, which practitioners may find helpful.
- Paper is well-written, and the main body is mostly easy-to-follow.

All in all, I like the representation result, which I think is neat in that it encompasses many learning settings, but my rating is limited by my opinion that the current version of the manuscript is incomplete, as detailed in the weaknesses.

### Weaknesses
1. It is not mentioned how nonbinary sensitive attributes are handled.

	- Related: How is the sensitive attribute of "race" in the COMPAS experiments, which can be one of three categories (African-American, Caucasian, Other), handled?

1. I am skeptical about the scalability of the proposed method to large datasets and more sensitive attributes.  It appears that the time complexity would scale exponentially in the number of sensitive attributes, i.e., $M^{K}$.

	- I see that $M$, the number of samples on which the decision boundaries are considered, is set to no more than 5000 in the experiments.  But practical ML datasets nowadays can contain tens of thousands to millions of examples.
	- Could the authors also report and compare the running time of their code?
	- Also, if $M<N_\textrm{val}$ is used for selecting the boundaries, then there should be a term involving $M$ in Theorem 2 (more on Theorem 2 below)?

1. Theorem 2 is very important as it provides fairness guarantees for the classifier obtained through the procedure.  But the result looks wrong to me, and seems to have a discrepancy with Algorithm 1.  The proof is also very hard to read, containing several typos.

	- DP should depend on $\epsilon_p$ (attributed to the error in $\hat p(A=1\mid X$), but this dependency is absent in eq. 14.  Digging into the proof, I see that it is hidden with the statement that "$\epsilon=\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2$, and assume that it is smaller than $\delta/2$".  Why is this assumption justified?
	- In the paragraph preceding eq. 15, what is $\hat Y_{t'}$?  Should it be $\check Y_{t'}$?  And what is $\check Y_{t'}^*$ in the paragraph following eq. 15?  Should it be $\check Y_{t'}$?
	- Following the above, I don't get why $DP(\check Y_{t'})+\epsilon \leq \delta$ but not $3\delta/2$, given that "let $t'$ corresponds to... under the constraint that $DP(\check Y_{t'})\leq \delta-\epsilon$".
	- I don't get why $DP(\check Y_{\hat t})\leq \delta -\epsilon_1$, how is $\check Y_{\hat t}$ related to $\check Y_{t'}$?
	- Finally, Theorem 2 only proves results for DP.  What about EO, EOp, and composite criteria?
	- Please also justify the assumptions made; are they practical?

1. In the experiments, the authors compared their proposed post-processing algorithm to ones that are attribute-aware, but their algorithm is run in attribute-unaware mode.  The authors should have compared to those algorithms by running their algorithm in the same attribute-aware mode.  In this sense, the current set of experiments is incomplete.

1. The conclusions drawn from the ablation study in section D.2 do no make sense to me.  How is accuracy related to the error $\mathbb E|\hat p(A=1\mid X) - p(A=1\mid X)|$ in Theorem 2?  In fact, regularization could in fact be reducing the aforementioned error despite huring accuracy.  One way to measure this is, e.g., using reliability diagrams.  The conclusion in D.2 that "this further confirms the robustness of our post-processing modification algorithm" does not make sense.

1. Some clarifications would be helpful:

	- Example 3 does not imply subgroup fairness, i.e., intersecting groups.
	- When introducing the composite criterion, it is also useful to mention that some fairness criteria are incompatible with each other (e.g., DP vs. EO).

### Summary
The paper characterizes the optimal classifier under fairness constraints as a simple postprocessing modification rule over the Bayes optimal classifier. Comparison with standard baselines demonstrates competitive results on three datasets.

### Strengths
- Novel characterization of the optimal fairness-constrained classifier as a "simple" modification rule over the Bayes optimal classifier.
  - Group-specific thresholding (Hardt et al., 2016) is a specific case of this rule where the sensitive attribute data is known at inference time; proving that simple thresholding is optimal for DP and EO when this information is known (with Bayes optimal scores).
  - Specific examples given for DP, EO, and equalized odds.
- The proposed method does not need explicit access to the sensitive attributes at inference time, but can also be given this information if available.
- Experiments conducted with relevant baselines on three well-known datasets, supporting the main paper claims.
- Additional sensitivity analysis and ablation studies on the robustness of the method to miss-estimated $p(A|X)$ or $p(Y|X)$.

### Weaknesses
- No code or results files are provided for the experiments; neither an implementation for the proposed method. This is largest point against the current version of the paper, as properly reviewing the work required checking some experimental details.

- Given that postprocessing baselines achieve Pareto dominant results in Fig. 2 (expectedly, as they have access to the sensitive attribute at inference time), it would be interesting to add partially relaxed results for these baselines for a more direct comparison (as done for the Zafar method).

Some comments regarding the CelebA results on Table 1:
- The proposed method is fitted with relaxed fairness constraint fulfillment ($\delta > 0$), while baselines are not ($\delta=0$). This does not seem to be a completely fair comparison.
- I'd find the small metric differences more meaningful if the "bolded results" rule were based on pair-wise statistical significance tests.
  - e.g., the bolded results of Table 5 are perhaps not significant.

Other notes:
- The compatibility with multiple over-lapping sensitive sub-groups (Example 3) is definitely a major advantage, but no experiments are shown for this evaluation setting.
- It'd be interesting to test against a simple baseline of using Hardt et al. group-specific thresholding using the same estimated $p(A|X)$ instead of the true sensitive attributes at inference time.

### Questions
- Is the base model used by MBS the same as those used by the baselines? Are the Zafar et al. (2017) results of Fig. 2 based on a constrained MLP?
- How was $p(Y,A|X)$ estimated when using MBS on CelebA?
- Do you see any reason why Hardt et al. (2016) would outperform on the Fig. 2 results, and achieve such lacklustre results on Table 1? Given that we see some variance/unreliability on fairness for MBS with $\delta=1$, can the even stricter constraint target by Hardt et al. (2016) (which uses $\delta=0$, right?) be related to its underperformance?
- Could you please clarify the main differences to Zeng et al. (2022), as it seems to tackle exactly the same problem.

Minor:
- Ticks for horizontal axes in Figures 3, 4 and 5 are miss-labeled.
  - Also, clarify that corrupted $p(Y|X)$ is the left figure, and $p(A|X)$ the right figure in the legend or plot titles.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of fair learning through post-processing: given an arbitrary predictor, we would like to post-process its predictions such that the new predictions satisfy a notion of group fairness, say demographic parity, while maintaining good accuracy. Standard methods for fairness through post-processing come up with a predictor that takes the sensitive attribute as input, and therefore, requires access to sensitive attributes at test time. This is not desirable because, in practice, laws and regulation might prohibit access to sensitive information. This paper introduces a new post-processing method that does not require this access; instead, it works with a conditional distribution of sensitive attributes (conditioned on all other features). More formally, let $(X,A,Y)$ represent features, sensitive attributes, and labels. Given a base classifier $\hat{Y} (X)$, a conditional distribution $\hat{P} (A,Y|X)$, the paper introduces an efficient algorithm that gives us a new classifier $\hat{Y}’ (X)$ that satisfies a desired notion of fairness, while approximately preserving the accuracy of $\hat{Y}$. They experiment with their proposed algorithm on Adult, COMPAS and CelebA data sets and find that in most cases their proposed algorithm outperforms (some) existing fair learning algorithms.

### Strengths
-A key challenge in fair learning is access to sensitive attributes. This paper acknowledges the fact that sensitive attributes may not be accessible in practice, and therefore, proposes a post-processing algorithm that does not require such access. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method is original and has significant impact.

-The authors accompany their theoretical guarantees with an extensive experimental analysis to show the efficacy of their algorithm.

-The paper is well-written and is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
-While the proposed method does not require access to sensitive attributes at test time, it still requires the conditional distribution of sensitive attributes $P(A|X)$, or a good estimate of it. It is not clear if this complies with laws and regulations: a company can still use their model of $P(A|X)$ to get good estimates of individual’s sensitive attribute. I’d like to see a discussion of this in the paper as well.

-Overall, the assumption that we have access to $P(Y, A|X)$, or a good estimate of it, could be strong in practice. For example, if I know a good estimate for $P(Y|X)$, I might as well use that as my predictor. Also, how are these conditional distributions learned? In practice, we observe every $x$ only once, so these probabilities are 0 or 1 on observed data, unless we work with parametric models like logistic regression. But which parametric model should we use here when the underlying unknown data distribution could be arbitrary? Also, how are these models chosen in your experiments?

-The paper claims that the performance of their method is better than “in-processing methods”. Is it better than all in-processing methods or just a few? This sounds like a very strong claim because, generally speaking, in-processing methods do achieve better performance than post-processing methods. Additionally, the most popular in-processing method for fair learning is given by Agarwal et al. 2018 (titled: "A reductions approach to fair classification"). Unfortunately, their algorithm is not included in the benchmarks for experiments. I would like to see a comparison of the two methods.

### Questions
-Do the theoretical results rely on the fact that $\hat{Y}$ is the Bayes optimal classifier. $\hat{Y}$ is introduced as the Bayes optimal on page 3 but later on is used as any predictor. It would’ve been better if $\hat{Y}$ was initially introduced as any predictor that we’d like to post-process its predictions.

-Can the validation data set be used to learn the conditional distributions? In practice we only have a pre-trained classifier and do not necessarily have pre-trained conditional distributions. If your method allows using the same validation set to learn these distributions, then all you’d need is the pre-trained classifier, increasing the flexibility of the proposed method.

-The title of the paper seems misleading. What does “optimal” mean here? Post-processing algorithms are known to be sub-optimal in general because their guarantees are benchmarked against the base classifier (e.g., see your theorem on page 7). Theoretically, in-processing methods achieve the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and fairness because they directly solve the constrained optimization problem instead of looking at the specific class of models that are derived by post-processing another model. This does need a clarification in the paper.

-Why does Hardt et al. (2016) have lower performance than your proposed method in the experiments? Hardt. et al. (2016) solves the same post-processing problem with the extra flexibility that the sensitive attribute can be used as an input to the model. Shouldn’t that just lead to better accuracy/fairness tradeoff?

I will increase my score if questions/weaknesses discussed above are addressed properly.

### Summary
This paper deals with the problem of fair classification where the goal is to find the classifier with maximum possible accuracy under constraints on the disparity in the performance of the classifier across groups with different values for some protected attributes. The paper proposes a post-hoc approach to achieve this. 

For binary classifiers: First, an unconstrained Bayes optimal classifier (Y'(X)), which maximizes accuracy, is learned. Then post-hoc, a modification rule is used to obtain a fairness constrained Bayes optimal classifier (Y''(X)) by modifying the output of Y'(X). This modification is done by mapping each instance to a probability with which the fairness constrained classifier disagrees with the unconstrained classifier. 

The paper proposes a definition of such a modification rule which is defined by an instance-level bias score which the authors propose, together with a measure of the uncertainty of the unconstrained classifier on a given instance. 

The authors propose definitions of the bias score for each of three popular fairness constraints, and show how the resulting modification rules leads to classifiers that satisfy the fairness constraints. The authors point out that unlike previous works, their approach enables us to find classifiers satisfying Equalized Odds fairness constraints.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a novel way to modify the output of the unconstrained Bayes optimal classifier post-hoc in order to satisfy fairness constraints. While this approach has been previously studied, I believe the instance-level bias scores are novel.
- The main significant technical contribution is the ability to satisfy Equalized Odds fairness constraints.
- Besides these, the characterization of the optimal modification rule in Theorem 1, which has the form of a linear combination of bias scores, one for each protected attribute is also very interesting. In particular, this enables the approach in Section 3 where together with an auxiliary model that estimates the values for the protected attributes, the bias score for examples in the test set can be computed without access to the values of the protected attributes.
- Together, I think the conceptual and technical contributions are both interesting and significant, and the topic is clearly relevant to ICLR and the research community working on fairness in ML.

### Weaknesses
- No major weakness apart a few issues with the writing and minor typos that can be fixed with a revision.
