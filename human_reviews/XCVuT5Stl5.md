# SENSITIVITY-INFORMED REGULARIZATION FOR OFFLINE BLACK-BOX OPTIMIZATION

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Offline optimization is an important task in numerous material engineering domains where online experimentation to collect data is too expensive and needs to be replaced by an in silico maximization of a surrogate of the black-box function. Although such a surrogate can be learned from offline data, its prediction might not be reliable outside the offline data regime, which happens when the surrogate has narrow prediction margin and is (therefore) sensitive to small perturbations of its parameterization. This raises the following questions: (1) how to regulate the sensitivity of a surrogate model; and (2) whether conditioning an offline optimizer with such less sensitive surrogate will lead to better optimization performance. To address these questions, we develop an optimizable sensitivity measurement for the surrogate model, which then inspires a sensitivity-informed regularizer that is applicable to a wide range of offline optimizers. This development is both orthogonal and synergistic to prior research on offline optimization, which is demonstrated in our extensive experiment benchmark.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of offline black-box optimization. In this problem, a surrogate model is trained to approximate the black-box objective function using a training dataset. The paper proposes a sensitivity measure of the surrogate model. Then, it proposes to train the surrogate model with this sensitivity measure as a regularization term. The goal is to achieve a surrogate model with low sensitivity. Thus, it avoids the problem of out-of-distribution prediction when performing the optimization.

### Strengths
The out-of-distribution problem in offline blackbox optimization is important and relevant to the community. The consideration of the model sensitivity seems to be new.

### Weaknesses
The proposed approach is not convincing and involves complicated approximations that may not be practical.

1. Could you please explain the rationale behind considering sensitivity across the entire input domain in the definition of the sensitivity measure, while our dataset (and hence our optimization) may only belong to a small manifold of the input domain?

2. The issue raised in the paper is the out-of-distribution prediction of the surrogate model for the black-box function. However, the paper solves it by using another surrogate model without addressing the out-of-distribution prediction of the model. For example, $\Phi(\gamma_i;w)$ is approximated with a neural network. It may also suffer from the out-of-distribution prediction, especially for the high dimensional input $\gamma_i$ which has the same dimension as $\phi$ (the parameters of a neural network). Hence, it raises a concern about the approximation quality.

3. $\Phi(\gamma_i;w)$ is either $0$ or $1$. Is it reasonable to approximate it with a neural network?

4. It is also unclear how tight is the upper bound of the sensitivity in Lemma 2. This issue deteriorates when this upper bound is further approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion. Hence, the resulting impact on the approximation quality is unknown.

5. Even though $\omega$ is trainable, its range still needs to be set manually to avoid the sensitivity measure being vacuous. This may be difficult in practice. Furthermore, other parameters such as $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ also need to be manually set.

### Questions
1. The sensitivity measure is defined by considering the expectation over random $x$ drawn from the input domain. What is the distribution of $x$ over the input domain? As $x$ can be a high-dimensional vector, sampling $x$ from its high-dimensional space seems to be very difficult.

2. Why is $\gamma$ drawn from a distribution with non-zero mean $\omega_{\mu}$? Another thing is whether it is reasonable to use the same $\sigma_{\sigma}$ for all parameters, given that some parameters may be very small while other parameters are larger (as these are parameters of a neural network).

3. Please also address the above weaknesses.

### Summary
This paper proposes to add a sensitivity regularization term to the function surrogate models to improve the performance on offline black-box optimization problem. The authors define the formulation of sensitivity measurement and derive its differentiable version via reparameterization of the Gaussian distribution. Comprehensive experiment on both continuous and discrete benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed regularization term is able to improve the algorithm performance on most cases.

### Strengths
1. The idea is clear and the paper is well written.

2. The experiment evaluation and ablation study is extensive and the result is impressive.

### Weaknesses
1. According to [1], the Superconductor and ChEMBL benchmarks do not have an exact function oracle, which may inherently have the sensitivity issue, and evaluations on these two benchmarks can not well access the model performance.

### Questions
1. The goal of the added regularization term is to make the surrogate function more accurate and less sensitive. In addition to the algorithm performance, can you show some surrogate prediction results with the regularization term?

2. In Table 1 and Ant Morphology task, seems that the variance of the CMA-ES increases with the performance. Can you give some insights of why this happens?

3. In Table 1 and TF Bind 10 task, seems that the REINFORCE with regularization term always find the global optimum. Can you give some insights of this impressive results?

### Summary
This paper investigates offline model-based optimization problems, which build a surrogate model using an offline dataset to approximate an unknown black-box function. This paper proposes an optimizable measurement of model sensitivity and proves its relationship with the brittleness of the model. In order to improve the model’s quality, this paper adds the measurement into the training objective and proposes a bi-level framework to automatically optimize both the measurement parameter $\omega$ and model parameter $\phi$. The key contribution of this paper is the novel measurement of model sensitivity, which can be used to regulate the existing gradient-based surrogate model. Experiment results in this paper appear to show the effectiveness of the improvement brought by model sensitivity regularization.

### Strengths
1. This paper is easy to follow and understand.
2. The proposed model sensitivity measurement is well-motivated. The authors provide a novel perspective of measuring the surrogate model’s quality, which theoretically contributes to offline MBO, and it can be scaled to other model-based domains, like BO and offline RL.
3. The procedure of optimizing \omega and \phi is reasonable.

### Weaknesses
Experiments are insufficient. Below are the main aspects and my advice:
    1. Lack of tasks. In Design-Bench (Trabucco et al., 2022), there are 8 real-world tasks while this paper only conducts 6 tasks, lacking Hopper-Controller from continuous domain and NAS from discrete domains.
    2. Lack of baselines. This paper only compares SIRO to basic baselines provided by Design-Bench, not containing recent works like Roma (Yu et al., 2021), NoMA (Fu & Levine, 2021), and IOM (Qi et al. 2022), which share a similar framework and sensitivity regularization can be easily applied to. Some works on offline MBO, like COMs (Trabucco et al., 2021), also add regularization terms to the learning objective. If the authors provide experiment comparisons between different regularization methods, the experiments will be more solid and persuading.

### Questions
1. Some mistakes in Eq.(6) and Eq.(7) where it should be $\omega = \arg \max_{\omega^{\prime}} \mathcal{S}(\alpha, \omega^{\prime})$ in Eq.(6) and $\lambda\cdot\max_{\omega^{\prime}}S_{\phi^{\prime}}(\alpha, \omega^{\prime})$.
2. In Definition 1, X is defined as the input space. Does “the input space” mean the offline dataset D? It may confuse the readers.

### Summary
This paper presents a framework for offline black-box optimization that accounts for the smoothness/sensitivity to perturbations of the learned surrogate model. The method works by including this sensitivity as a regularization term when training the surrogate model, for which the authors provide a practical scheme and approximation. Many computational benchmarks are used to show that the proposed framework improves existing offline black-box optimization methods.

### Strengths
1. The presentation of the regularization methodology and practical implementations is very clear.
2. The results are very impressive and show that the proposed method performs well across a wide variety of problems. Furthermore, the method seems to generalize to improve many algorithms for offline black-box optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. While the results show the improvements that come from adding this regularization term, it would be interesting to see how this compares with other methods for regularization, e.g., when tuned properly, standard $L_1$ and $L_2$-norm regularization may help avoid overfitting. More advanced methods may also indirectly penalize non-smoothness.
2. Similarly, the idea of avoiding large output changes subject to a perturbation into the decision variable could be compared against methods assuming the worst-case perturbation, i.e., robust black-box optimization or robust Bayesian optimization [1].
3. The method seems to improve the best-case performance of an algorithm, but performance at the 50th and 75th percentiles is a lot less impressive.

### Questions
1. Given that offline black-box optimization assumes you already have a batch of samples, could this information be used to help select the hyperparameters of the proposed regularized? Otherwise, the user is guessing the smoothness of an unknown black-box function.
2. Does regularizing for smoothness make the trained parametric surrogate models behave more similarly to Gaussian processes with standard kernels (i.e., sampling from smooth functions)?
