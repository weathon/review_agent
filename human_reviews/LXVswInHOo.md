- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 6, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Language models are currently trained to predict tokens given document prefixes, enabling them to zero shot long form generation and prompting-style tasks which can be reduced to document completion. We instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are trained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. Our approach builds on the fact that current pipelines train by concatenating random sets of shorter documents to create longer context windows; this improves efficiency even though the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. Given this fact, we can do IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data. To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent batches with a graph cover algorithm. Our experiments show IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING offers a scalable and simple approach to significantly enhance LM performance: we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual reasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%), faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and retrieval augmentation (+9%).

### Summary
In this study, the authors argue that the conventional method of sequence construction, which involves random sentence concatenation from disparate documents, fails to provide adequate training signals for language pre-training.
They introduce an alternative approach termed 'in-context pre-training,' which concatenates relevant documents identified via a retrieval model. Specifically, they first construct a document graph in which the documents are nodes and edges are valued by the similarity between two documents. Then they employ a greedy strategy to concatenate the documents, i.e., constructing the sequence for language pre-training.
Empirical evaluations across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that in-context pre-training consistently surpasses the performance of the baseline, except on close-booked question answering.

### Strengths
1. Clear motivation and presentation: enhancing LM’s understanding of context is intriguing and makes a lot of sense to me. The authors effectively articulate the problem, motivation, and proposed solution, making it easy to follow and comprehend the paper.
2. Strong empirical results and interesting findings: the comprehensive experiments provide compelling evidence that in-context pre-training (achieved by simply constructing sequence with relevant documents) yields improvements across diverse downstream tasks, with the exception of close-booked question answering.
3. Reproducibility: the proposed approach is straightforward to reimplement, requiring only minor modifications to existing pre-training procedures for further exploration and validation. The traversal process is also clearly delineated.

### Weaknesses
This paper  could further be enhanced from the following perspectives:
1. In Section 3.3.4, the authors attribute the inconsistent performance in a closed-book setting to the “ICLM memorizes less”. This claim could benefit from further elaboration. As we see better perplexity on language modeling, seems ICLM should memorizes more with the help of relevant documents.
2. According to the presented results, ICLM outperforms baselines in in-context settings. Experiments in out-of-context setting could be added for us to better understand the proposed ICLM.
3. The related work section could be improved by discussing a broader range of previous studies.  For example, the first paragraph of Section 5 only refers to three papers to summarize ‘pre-training with related documents’, however, there are other works with similar ideas including [1] use dictionary as context, [2] use co-occurrence of words across sentences as context for language pre-training, among others.

### Questions
I would appreciate it if the authors could provide answers to the following questions:
1. Could the authors offer additional information regarding the 'standard way' of constructing the sequence? To my understanding, it's common to create a sequence using texts from successive documents[3], wherein the texts are naturally semantically relevant to each other. Is the approach different in this case because the sequence length is so extensive that most documents cannot fill a single sequence? I would appreciate further clarification on this matter.
2. Could you provide an estimate of the time required for the graph construction and traversal processes at your experimental scale?
3. I am intrigued by the scalability of the proposed approach in a practical context. If we receive new raw text data, will we have to repeat the similarity computation, graph construction and graph traversal processes?

### Summary
A naive approach to language modeling on large corpora often considers randomly concatenating documents within the corpora together during training, resulting in long contexts which may not be relevant to the current next-word prediction. In this work, the authors conjecture that this naive approach harms a models ability to learn to attend to long-range dependencies during both language modeling, as well as down-stream tasks. To address this, the authors propose In-context pretraining (ICP), which, prior to language model pre-training, groups and sorts document by their similarity such that a language model is trained on several related documents contiguously.

To perform this grouping, ICP first uses _contreiver_ (a similarity-based retriever model from prior work) to first obtain a set of nearest neighbors for each document. Then the authors propose a modified version of a greedy algorithm to the traveling salesman problem to obtain a path through all the documents such that no documents repeat but most documents will appear next to their nearest neighbors. The resulting path is then treated as the document order for input to the LM, which is split into several contiguous chunks which serve as the pre-training corpora.

The authors consider two baselines: naive pre-training, which randomly shuffles and concatenates documents together, and kNN pre-training, which groups documents by similarity, but can have high document duplication and overlap.
The authors demonstrate that LLMs trained with ICP significantly outperform standard LMs and kNN LMs on both language modeling, as well as on several downstream tasks including in-context learning, reading comprehension, and retrieval augmentation, highlighting the importance of long-range consistency and dependency in LM pre-training.

### Strengths
- The method, and proposed algorithm, are very simple to understand but significantly outperform the reasonable baselines across several downstream evaluations.
- The paper is very well written and clear. The core hypothesis and motivation are both easy to understand and reasonable.
- The paper considers models that go up to a rather large size, up to 7B parameter models which are pre-trained from scratch on 306B tokens. While this is not state-of-the-art in terms of model size, these are nevertheless very convincing experimental settings.
- There is some ablation study showing that the deduplication strategy is very important for the observed results, and that the benefits of ICP arise consistently over training (are not explained by variance).

### Weaknesses
- The core methodological contribution of the paper is perhaps relatively small. The novelty of the work comes from the identification that data duplication in kNN-based groupings is a problem, and in section 2.2 which addresses the data duplication problem via a greedy algorithm. Most of the paper instead covers the (extensive) evaluation of the proposed method.
- The analysis section feels quite weak, outside of the ablation study over data deduplication (I'm not sure if document relevance is a repeat result, see questions). I'm not sure how much section 4 really helps us understand why ICLM works better than Standard LM, which feels important given how simple the proposed method really is.

### Questions
What is the difference between the results presented in 4.2 for Document Relevance, and the results presented in Figure 3 (a)? It seems to me as though this ablation analysis was already performed in the main results section.

### Summary
This paper introduces In-Context Pretraining for Language Models (ICLM), a novel approach that connects relevant documents during the pretraining of LLM. In contrast to existing pretraining methods that mainly use random concatenation, ICLM employs a more targeted approach.

Given the substantial number of pretraining documents, this paper presents an approximate algorithm for efficiently identifying related documents.

The experimental results of ICLM surpass those of the traditional method and a KNN-based approach across various tasks, particularly excelling in long-form reasoning tasks such as Hotpot QA and Drop.

### Strengths
This paper addresses an evident and critical issue in LLM pretraining. 
The experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of comparison with existing works. Some previous studies have used hyperlinks or timestamps to group related documents together. Although these papers are discussed in the Related Work section, it would be beneficial to understand how the proposed method compares to these existing approaches by reporting the results.

2. Lack of information about the computational and time costs of the Retrieval process and DOCUMENT GRAPH TRAVERSAL process. It would be helpful to demonstrate the relationship between the size of the pretraining data and the time cost of the proposed algorithm.

### Questions
1. Are you using a multilingual Contriver or an English Contriver? I'm thinking that if you are using the multilingual retrieval, the LLM (Large Language Model) may be better for machine translation or multilingual downstream tasks, which is a strong point of the proposed method.

2. Do you want to discuss the code data and the proposed method? Maybe for the code data, each repository should be concatenated together instead of relying on retrieval. Is this a possible limitation of the proposed method?
