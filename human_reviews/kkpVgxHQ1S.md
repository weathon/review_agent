# Latent Diffusion Counterfactual Explanations

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a promising method for elucidating the behavior of opaque black-box models. Recently, several works leveraged pixel-space diffusion models for counterfactual generation. To handle noisy, adversarial gradients during counterfactual generation--causing unrealistic artifacts or mere adversarial perturbations--they required either auxiliary adversarially robust models or computationally intensive guidance schemes. However, such requirements limit their applicability, e.g., in scenarios with restricted access to the model's training data. To address these limitations, we introduce Latent Diffusion Counterfactual Explanations (LDCE). LDCE harnesses the capabilities of recent class- or text-conditional foundation latent diffusion models to expedite counterfactual generation and focus on the important, semantic parts of the data. Furthermore, we propose a novel consensus guidance mechanism to filter out noisy, adversarial gradients that are misaligned with the diffusion model's implicit classifier. We demonstrate the versatility of LDCE across a wide spectrum of models trained on diverse datasets with different learning paradigms. Finally, we showcase how LDCE can provide insights into model errors, enhancing our understanding of black-box model behavior.

### Rating
6: marginally above the acceptance threshold

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a model-agnostic and computationally efficient diffusion model-based framework that can generate counterfactual explanations. Specifically, the model leverages the gradient of the classifier of a conditional diffusion model to filter out the gradient that is not semantically relavent or unimportant, which is natual and reasonable.

### Strengths
(1) The problem that the paper aims to solve is significant anf appealing. 
(2) The proposed method that uses gradient of the classifier of a conditional diffusion model is straitforward and novel to me.
(3) They showed good performance in the experimental section, indicating the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
(1) It seems that the counterfactual explanation explained in the paper is very relavent to "semantic consistency" in [1]. I would suggest the author also discuss this paper.
(2) How will the angular threshold affect the model performance? My concern is that if we mask too much then the model might loose too much information to reconstruct the image.

### Confidence

### Summary
This paper introduces the Latent diffusion counterfactual explanation which uses latent diffusion models to expedite counterfactual generation and focus on the important semantic parts of the data. They propose a novel consensus guidance mechanism to filter out noisy,
adversarial gradients that are misaligned with the diffusion model’s implicit classifier.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a novel approach using class or text foundational diffusion models to generate counterfactual explanations that are both model and dataset-agnostic. The consensus guidance mechanism seems interesting and novel.

### Weaknesses
The paper presents a comprehensive study focused on images, but it appears that experiments on tabular datasets are missing. Tabular data is frequently encountered in various applications such as finance, healthcare, and retail, where counterfactual explanations are of significant interest (i.e., loan approval dataset).  Would your proposed method extend to these settings?

The paper indicated that their method expedites the counterfactual generation process in the main paper however they claim it is slow in the limitations section.

### Questions

## Human Reviewer 3

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number

### Confidence

### Summary
Counterfactual explanation aims to find the realistic input data with the smallest semantically meaningful change that results in the counterfactual output.
To obtain such fake-but-counterfactually-realistic data, the authors utilized latent diffusion models and arbitrary classifier can be jointly adopted.
The authors argue that (1) the diffusion process in the latent space allows the proposed LDCE to focus on the important semantics of the data rather than the unimportant details; and (2) the proposed threshold-based consensus guidance mechanism against the implicit classifier can filter out meaningless adversarial gradients so that it enables capturing meaningful gradients for the counterfactual sample.

### Strengths
Strength

- The proposed method is very simple and easy to apply.
- The paper is easy to follow in general.
- The proposed method can be utilized to any LDMs.
- The implementation is properly provided for the reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
Weakness

- The paper should be written in more formal way.
- There lacks explanation on Algorithm 1 in the main body of the paper, which makes it hard to understand the technical connection between the proposed method and algorithm.
- Some generated counterfactual examples seem to be unrealistic. (Possibly, the threshold-based gradient filter cannot properly filter out the adversarial gradients?)
- The authors argued that the proposed threshold-based consensus guidance mechanism filters out the meaningless adversarial gradients, but when it comes to Figure 4, it seems that those the consensus guidance mechanism cannot filter out those gradients. For example, in Figure 4(f), intervening "bulldog" to "beagle" should not affect the grass texture since it should not be sensitive to the breed of dogs. It seems that those factors are not perfectly disentangled in the latent or noise space.
- Definitely, the proposed method is quantitatively outperformed in the CelebA case.
