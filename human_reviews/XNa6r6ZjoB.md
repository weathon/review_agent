# Abstractors and relational cross-attention: An inductive bias for explicit relational reasoning in Transformers

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
An extension of Transformers is proposed that enables explicit relational reasoning through a novel module called the *Abstractor*. At the core of the Abstractor is a variant of attention called *relational cross-attention*. The approach is motivated by an architectural inductive bias for relational learning that disentangles relational information from object-level features. This enables explicit relational reasoning, supporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is first evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to existing relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely relational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in sample efficiency compared to standard Transformers. Finally, Abstractors are evaluated on a collection of tasks based on mathematical problem solving, where consistent improvements in performance and sample efficiency are observed.

### Summary
This paper presents a modification on attention that replaces the value part of self-attention with an "relational-only" representation S. This representation serves as an "information bottleneck" for the model so that it can learn separate encodings for object relations and values (eg in a separate encoder). The experimental results are strong and offer good empirical support for the effectiveness of the Abstractor layer.

### Strengths
- The proposed abstractor method outperforms all baselines and is more sample efficient in learning relational tasks.
- The proposed method is interesting and a relatively simple modification on top of self-attention. However, I have some questions about how S works (below)

### Weaknesses
- It is not clear to me how S works. Section 2.2 says "The symbols S can be either learned parameters of the model or nonparametric positional embeddings." How is S different from a positional embedding then? If S is unique per token, even if the token is a repeat of another token value-wise, then S is essentially a positional embedding. If S is unique per *value* of a token (ie all tokens of value v have the same s_i), then doesn't S implicity encode the value of the token?
- If the outputs of an abstractor layer are "abstract states that represent purely relational information" (section 2.3), then how are features associated with objects passed along/learned in models that use abstractor layers? In all the examples presented in Figure 2, abstractors are used in conjunction with regular encoders. How can you ensure that the abstractor is learning meaningful information and that all the "information flow" does not happen through the encoder layers in parlalle setups (architectures c, d, and e)? 
- Section 4.1 claims that the authors hypothesize that "the ability to model relations as multi-dimensional is also the reason that the Abstractor can learn the order relation better than ..." Are there any experiments to test or verify this hypothesis? The paper also makes many claims about an information bottleneck in S, but there is no analysis on what is actually learned in S.
- Is there an ablation on model size? The baseline transformer is not very large, but it may be that a smaller transformer can learn with fewer training data points, or a larger transformer may converge faster.
- The experiments seem to be on simple problems with small models. Simple problems may not necessarily be an issue since they are relatively diverse problems, but it would be nice to see larger, more complicated problems. For example, the partial order task training set is small enough that one could consider using in context learning with a large LLM, which may offer comparable performance.

### Summary
The motivation of this paper lies in addressing the challenge of relational and abstract reasoning. Contemporary deep learning models excel at tasks involving semantic and procedural knowledge, but their abilities to infer relations, draw analogies, and generalize from limited data to novel situations remain limited. The popular Transformer architecture, through its attention mechanisms, has the capacity to model relations between objects implicitly. However, these standard attention mechanisms often create entangled representations, blending relational information and object-level features in a way that is not optimal for efficient learning of relations.

This paper proposes a new variant of Transformers, named the Abstractor. The core of the Abstractor is a variant of attention, named relational cross-attention. Compared to the vanilla attention in the Transformer, relational cross-attention disentangles the object-level feature and relational information by replacing the value vector in vanilla attention with a learnable symbol vector or positional function, which is independent of the object-level feature (X). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their Abstractor through "pure relational" and "partial relational" tasks, and compare the Abstractor to previous architectures designed for relational tasks.

### Strengths
1. The overall problem is interesting. As the author has noted, human brains can perform tasks involving analogy and abstraction with limited experience, whereas current models require vast amounts of data to acquire such abilities.

2. The proposed Abstractor, a novel variant of the Transformer model, disentangles relational and objective features through relative cross-attention. 

3. The authors have proven, through comprehensive experiments, that the Abstractor is more sample-efficient than the vanilla Transformer and previous architectures used for pure or partial relational tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The overly constrained setting limits the significance of the work. The authors conduct experiments under two settings: "purely relational" and "partially relational". As per the authors' definition, "purely relational" implies that object-level features are extraneous and that the statistics of relation/order are already sufficient for solving the task. This is an extremely restricted setting and may not fully represent the complexity of real-world tasks where both relational and object-level information are often important. The authors use math problem-solving to represent the "partially relational" setting, but the math problem here is arguably more relational/symbolic than object-level. It seems like the math problems here can be solved by symbolic rules.

2. Scalability is one of the most significant advantages of Transformer architectures. The performance can increase with the model size and data size. Given that the Abstractor is a variant of the Transformer, it's essential to determine whether the scaling law still applies to the Abstractor. From the results provided, the performance can outperform the vanilla Transformer when the data size increases from the 1000 - 5000 range. But what about using more data and a larger model size? Will the Abstractor consistently improve and outperform the Transformer?
3. Why did the authors choose to replace value vectors with input-independent vectors, while keeping the query and key vectors the same (Q -- X, K -- X, V -- S)? Would not the configuration (Q -- S, K -- S, V -- X) also disentangle object-level features (x) and symbolic vectors (s)? To me, the latter one is more intuitive: the relation weight R_{ij} between i, j is represented by the inner product of symbolic vectors, and then object-level features are weighted by R_{ij}.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel Abstractor module that uses relational cross-attention to enable explicit relational reasoning. such relational cross-attention disentangles relational information from object-level features. The experimental results show that such explicit relational reasoning greatly improves the sample efficiency of Transformers on relational tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The Abstractor module and relational cross-attention are novel and interesting, simple but effective.
3. The method is well motivated and the proposed method is well justified on a variety of tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. When comparing sample efficiency on pure relational tasks, the Abstractor is only compared to the Transformer baseline. It would be better to show the comparison with other relational structures like PrediNet.
2. There is no explicit section for related work and limitations are not discussed.

### Questions
1. Could you compare both the performance and sample efficiency of Abstractor with other relational structures like PrediNet?
2. STSN (Mondal et al., 2023) has used Transformer for RAVEN and PGM problems, which involve relational reasoning, how much would the Abstractor improve over Transformer in those tasks?

### Summary
The authors introduce a modification of self-attention, referred to as "Relational Cross-Attention" (RCA), in which value projections are replaced with input-independent vectors, referred to as "symbols".  These symbols are either learned or implemented as (relative) positional embeddings. Additionally, the softmax function used in the attention operation can be replaced with element-wise activation functions for improved performance on some tasks. The authors replace the attention-layer in a transformer encoder layer with RCA, and refer to the resulting layer as an _Abstractor Module_. 

Various experiments on toy-problems requiring relational reasoning are carried out. The authors show that Abstractors out-perform transformers and CoRelNets (another explicitly relational baseline) on these tasks, and that Abstractors are able to learn generalizable relations (demonstrated through pre-training experiments) and can easily be constrained to learn only symmetric relations (through symmetric inner products $\phi_{\theta}(x)^\top \phi_{\theta}(x)$, rather than the default $\phi_{\theta}(x)^\top \psi_\omega(x)$ in RCA). Additionally, they experiment with various forms of overall architecture, varying whether the Abstractor layer is used alongside Encoders (in parallel or in sequence) prior to decoding.

### Strengths
Overall presentation is very clear and the method is well-explained, though the analogy to self-attention may be better mentioned earlier in the paper, rather than first "deriving" the relationship between the calculation of a project relation matrix and $QK^\top$ Self-Attention. 

The experiments serve to demonstrate the efficacy of Abstractors in toy settings, and some effort is made to demonstrate that they do indeed learn re-usable relations which are robust to noisy data. Alongside the ablations, these provide sufficient evidence that abstractors provide a strong relational inductive bias which may make them useful in more applied settings - though this remains to be demonstrated. 

The experiments comparing Abstractors with pre-learned relations (per-head) against a symbolic input MLP are particularly well-thought-out and interesting, in that they go some way toward demonstrating the generality of the learned relations.

### Weaknesses
Methodologically there are no substantial weaknesses, as comparisons against baselines are made as fair as possible. One minor exception is the omission of a baseline transformer for the Order Relation and SET tasks, though this was presumably an intentional omission based on the already superior performance of CoRelNet compared to Transformers?

There is one consistently made claim which may be slightly overstated (this is a question to the authors) - namely that the output of Abstractors represents "purely relational information"; I believe this only holds if there are no residual connections in the abstractor module implementation being used (which is offered as an option); if there is a residual connection, then it seems the abstractor MLP could still learn to operate on information present in object-level representations.

Related to the above point, it would be very interesting to see an attempt to "lift" the learned relational information into a symbolic form, as was done e.g. in the cited PrediNet work (Shanahan)

### Questions
Some minor questions:
1. Multi-attention decoder: Perhaps this form of decoder is standard, but why is CausalSelfAttention used before Cross-Attention (which is not causally masked?)
2. On the Math Problem experiments: It seems the dataset consists of 8 tasks, but only 5 of these are investigated in the experiments. Is there a particular reason for this omission?
3. On the SET Comparison against a symbolic-input model: When pre-training the abstractor relations, is the input from the same pre-trained CNN as when training the multi-head abstractor, or also from the symbolic inputs?
4. The authors argue that relations are well-modelled as inner-products. I am curious as to which differences this might impose on the learned relations when compared to the relational-form used in the PrediNet, in which a difference of projections ("differential comparator") is used?
