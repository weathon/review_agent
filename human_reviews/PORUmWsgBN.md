# DiffPoseTalk: Speech-Driven Stylistic 3D Facial Animation and Head Pose Generation via Diffusion Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 5

## Abstract
The generation of stylistic 3D facial animations driven by speech poses a significant challenge as it requires learning a many-to-many mapping between speech, style, and the corresponding natural facial motion. However, existing methods either employ a deterministic model for speech-to-motion mapping or encode the style using a one-hot encoding scheme. Notably, the one-hot encoding approach fails to capture the complexity of the style and thus limits generalization ability. In this paper, we propose DiffPoseTalk, a generative framework based on the diffusion model combined with a style encoder that extracts style embeddings from short reference videos. During inference, we employ classifier-free guidance to guide the generation process based on the speech and style. We extend this to include the generation of head poses, thereby enhancing user perception. Additionally, we address the shortage of scanned 3D talking face data by training our model on reconstructed 3DMM parameters from a high-quality, in-the-wild audio-visual dataset. Our extensive experiments and user study demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

### Summary
The paper presents a diffusion-based method to generate co-speech 3D facial motions, particularly motions conditioned on various speaking styles. To this end, the proposed learning model consists of multiple components: the Wav2Vec2 Encoder to encode the speech, a transformer-based denoising decoder to generate current face motion parameters from the speech embeddings and noisy, past face motion parameters, and a transformer-based style encoder trained on a set of reference videos with a contrastive loss to incorporate the desired speaking styles into the face motions. The authors show the benefits of their proposed method through quantitative evaluations, ablation studies, and user studies.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method of generating facial motion parameters from speech through a denoising diffusion process is technically sound.

2. The style encoder offers customizability to the generated face motions and improves the utility of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. In Sec. 1, para 2, the authors note that facial motions require more "precise" alignment with speech than other human body motions, such as gestures and dance. However, it is not clear what this "precision" entails and how, or if, it can be measured. What are the specific design choices in the denoising diffusion architecture, or the training loss functions and hyperparameters, or some other aspects, that are necessary for the successful learning of facial motions from speech? In other words, why would an existing diffusion architecture for body motion generation (such as [A] or [B], albeit with different training features) not work for this problem?

2. While the style encoder offers more customizability to the generated face motions, it seems to be limited to the reference videos received during training. Is this understanding correct, or can the style encoder generalize to novel styles during inference?

### Questions
1. What is the latency of the end-to-end generation pipeline during inference? What is the latency of the stylization component?

2. For Eqn. 2, is there any specific reason to operate on the vertex space and on the parameter space? The vertex space is much higher dimensional and less constrained, which could make the training more unstable.

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework DiffPoseTalk that utilizes a diffusion model with a style encoder. DiffPoseTalk generates 3D speech-driven talking face videos and it is capable of changing the style of the generated videos and can generate video depicting the style of the given short reference video. The model uses a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 encoder as an audio feature extractor and 3DMM as face representation. Also, it uses a transformer-based denoising network for 3D talking face generation. Moreover, they built a talking face dataset TFHP with 704 videos of 302 subjects.

### Strengths
A talking face dataset is proposed.

The manuscript is clear and easy to follow.

The manuscript has equations and figures that support the writing.

The model is evaluated well and it is compared to state-of-the-art (see question 1)

### Weaknesses
There is no discussion of ethical considerations.

Limitations are not elaborated.

### Questions
The ablation study model without CFG shows that it does not have much effect on the results (especially LVE and FDD). Can you elaborate this?

### Summary
This paper proposes a generative diffusion model (DiffPoseTalk) combined with a style encoder that extracts style embeddings from short reference videos for 3D facial animations driven by speech. The generation process is extended to include the generation of head poses. The model is trained on reconstructed 3DMM parameters from a high-quality, in-the-wild audio-visual dataset.

### Strengths
The main contributions are:
- A diffusion-based approach is proposed to jointly generate diverse and stylistic 3D facial motions with head poses from speech.
- A style encoder is developed to extract personalized speaking styles from reference videos, which can be used to guide the motion generation in a classifier-free manner.
- An audio-visual dataset is constructed that includes a range of diverse identities and head poses.

### Weaknesses
- In Section 4.1 it is motivated the use of synthesis data as a source for training the proposed architecture. It is also reported the 3D face reconstruction method in Filntisis et al., 2022) based on a 3DMM is used for accurate reconstruction of lip movements. This reconstruction than learning of a set of 3DMM parameters with related lips movements based on these 2D datasets. However, this is not much convincing to me. Lips movements associated to speech are quite subtle and with specificity from each individual. Reconstructing such subtle movements with a 3DMM from a 2D video sequence seems not capable of capturing the reality of movement. In my opinion, authors should convince the readers more about this point which is also fundamental for the proposed approach. 
- Table 1 is not fully convincing because the other compared methods were developed for working with different data and so the proposed evaluation could be somewhat biased. 
- The supplemental video material is not fully convincing. For some speech the lips movement and the audio track are not well synchronized. The lips movement is also quite synthetic with the lips that are not able to close. The movement is also on the lips only without facial expression shown during face lips animation.
- There is not much discussion on the proposed method. In particular, limitations of the proposed approach are not evidenced.

---
I have read the other reviews, and the authors’ rebuttal. I thank the authors for their answers and revised paper. The rebuttal has clarified some of the unconvincing points in the original submission. Taking this into consideration I changed my score to marginally below the acceptance threshold. 
However, I still think the approach is not convincing in the way it produces synchronized lip movements (looking to the supplementary videos synchronization seems rather unrealistic in most of the cases) as well as the comparison is carried out with other methods in the literature. 
Overall, the paper is questionably at the bar for ICLR acceptance.

### Questions
Q1: authors should make it evident the methods for lips reconstruction can provide results similar to the real one. I understand this is not the focus of the paper but the proposed approach relies on this assumption which is not enough supported and makes evidence in my opinion. 
For example authors could compare results obtained with synthetic data and real one using their solution
Q2: an experiments using real data could have been reported (e.g., VOCASET) for a better comparison with other methods.

### Summary
The paper presents a method for audio-driven facial animation, where reference style is modeled using a reference video (3D tracking of the video) encoder (and not generic one-hot encoding) and diffusion-based denoising network for final vertex animation. The main contribution of the paper is to introduce the use of diffusion (similar to Tevet '23 et al) for audio-driven talking head generation. While overall no new loss functions (except a simple smoothness loss) are introduced, however, the end-to-end formulation is novel, along with reference style encoding using transformers and contrastive learning and head pose movement. Finally, like previous approaches W2V2 is used for audio feature extraction. The paper also introduces a small dataset of tracked videos with richer set of emotion and style variations. Overall the method outperforms several SOTA methods wrt to quality of articulation and style transfers and provides ablations for their method.

### Strengths
- A novel formulation for target style-encoding that's able to extract salient features from target video via tracking and use these for "style-transfer".
- Lack of high-quality data in this space is a big problem, and hence the small dataset release for audio-driven facial animation is a welcome contribution.
- Diffusion-based approach for final audio-driven facial animation. Given that for this part the work build up on Tevet '23 et al, it's a less novel contribution
- The SOTA comparisons and user-studies suggest the proposed solution provides improvement over previous approaches.

### Weaknesses
- While the paper claims that they can meaningfully extract "style" from the reference videos, in the examples shown in the video (2:42), they don't show the reference styles so it's hard to understand how faithfully the reference style was matched, further only a a single example for the same is shown.
- In the user-study the authors claim that they have superior scores, but none of the user study samples are shared, so it's hard to understand what the users were really scoring. 
- The paper does not discuss or define, what they define as style, and how they measure "style" disentanglement from "content".

### Questions
- What metric will you use to measure the disentanglement between style and content? Can you show a couple of example of style or content muted performances (where the original video is assumed to have both)?
- Can you explain the motivation behind the contrastive loss for your problem? It's unclear why contrastive training makes sense intuitively.
