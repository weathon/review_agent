# XTSFormer: Cross-Temporal-Scale Transformer for Irregular Time Event Prediction

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 3, 3, 6

## Abstract
Event prediction aims to forecast the time and type of a future event based on a historical event sequence. Despite its significance, several challenges exist, including the irregularity of time intervals between events, cycles, periodicity, and the complex multi-scale nature of event interactions, as well as the potentially high computational costs for long event sequences. However, current neural temporal point processes (TPPs) methods do not capture the multi-scale nature of event interactions, which is common in many real-world applications such as clinical event data. To address these issues, we propose the cross-temporal-scale transformer (XTSFormer), designed specifically for irregularly timed event data. Our model comprises two vital components: a novel Feature-based Cycle-aware Positional Encoding (FCPE) that adeptly captures the cyclical nature of time, and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism. These scales are determined by a bottom-up clustering algorithm. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our XTSFormer outperforms several baseline methods in prediction performance.

### Rating
8: accept, good paper

8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new model called XTSFormer for irregularly timed event data, and highlights its superior performance compared to baseline methods. The XTSFormer includes a unique Feature-based Cycle-aware Positional Encoding and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism to address these challenges.

### Strengths
1. The proposed PCPE incorporates event type information. It is reasonable to use type information for better embedding.
2. The proposed multi-scale attention is novel and useful.
3. The use of Weibull distribution improves performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed FCPE seems to be Mercer time embedding [1] parameterized by event type. It would be great to present the comparison with Mercer time embedding.
2. The ablation studies on the NLL/RMSE with FCPE, attention, and weibull distribution should be presented.
3. The use of event type prediction somehow hinders the models from being a generative model. Can authors run experiments on using the event type prediction similar to ANHP[2]?

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposed a method for predicting the time and type of future events based on a historical event sequence. The model has two main components:
• A feature-based cycle-aware positional encoding (FCPE) that encodes both the cyclic and semantic information of event times into a vector representation.
• A cross-temporal-scale transformer that captures the multi-scale temporal dependencies among events using a hierarchical clustering algorithm and a cross-scale attention mechanism.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an interesting issue of event prediction (time and type) using irregular and multi-scale temporal data.
The paper addresses a significant problem, namely event prediction and event timing in the presence of irregularities. This has not been addressed before, which is more challenging than a typical forecasting task.
The paper includes a comprehensive ablation study of each component, and the experiment was conducted on a set of real-world data.

### Weaknesses
The model component lacks novelty, which can be seen as a limitation. Nonetheless, the paper's exploration of event prediction within irregular sequences is an interesting topic.

The paper never addresses state-of-the-art irregular models recently introduced, including ODE-based models [1-4], which is critical to be added as one of the baseline models.
Recent models [2,3,4] can handle irregular time series more effectively without the need for data grouping based on temporal scale. A comparison with ODE-based models is essential.

The paper is generally well-written. However, the model component is difficult to understand; many details are in the appendix.
There are issues in the organization of Section 3, particularly in understanding the connection between different modules. For instance, Section 3.2.4, which outlines the overall model architecture, must be presented at the beginning of Section 3, followed by a breakdown of individual module components. The excessive use of subsubsections with limited content also hampers the paper's clarity. Structural improvements are needed to enhance the overall readability.

### Questions
There are notable issues with the clarity and novelty of the proposed model. Why has ODE based models not considered for comparison?

Why is the use of hierarchical classification needed? It raises concerns due to the data preprocessing required.

### Summary
The cross-temporal-scale transformer (XTSFormer) is proposed as a solution for unevenly timed event data. The approach is built around two key components: a unique Feature-based Cycle-aware Positional Encoding (FCPE) that captures the cyclical character of time and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism. A bottom-up clustering technique determines these scales. Extensive testing on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrates that our XTSFormer exceeds various baseline methods in prediction performance.

### Strengths
It is the first work to take into account multi-scale features in neural TPPs.

They introduce a novel time positional encoding, the Feature-based Cycle-aware Positional Encoding (FCPE), which incorporates both feature and cyclical information. This approach strengthens our model’s capacity to capture complex temporal patterns.

They design a cross-scale attention operation within the multi-scale hierarchy and compare the time cost with default all-pair attention.

### Weaknesses
(1) It is not so clear why multi-scale patterns are so important for event sequences. In introduction, there is no explanation about the benefits of multi-scale features.

(2) Multi-scale temporal attention mechanism has been widely published in previous papers [1][2]. Cycle-aware Time Embedding has been proposed in [3]. Please describe the difference between your paper and these published papers. The novelty is limited.

(3) Eq.6 and Eq. 7 are unnecessary. They are the commonsense of attention mechanism and MLP.

(4) Section 3.2.3 is so simple. Please add more analysis about Flops and memory cost of your model.

(5) Each equation should be followed of commas or full stop. Please clarify it.

(6) Some formulas are not clearly defined, such as the missing definition of P(ti) in Eq. (5)

(7) The writing of the paper can be improved as there are many typos.

### Summary
The paper presents a natural extension of the Temporal Point Process framework. The idea is to use data split to improve the learning. In particular, the authors propose a specific way to cluster event sequences and calculate modified attention based on such a clustering.

### Strengths
- Interesting idea and delivered algorithm
- Reasonable number of datasets in the comparison
- Time cost analysis performed. It shows the superiority of the considered approach for long sequences.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed approach can limit the performance for complex long-range dependencies
- Most alternative approaches consider a different structure for event type and intensity prediction, which makes a comparison not 100% fair (while I consider it not a big problem)
- No comparison to other clustering approaches for TPP [1]. However, it is also tolerable, given that the paper came out in 2023. Also lack of comparison with clustering based on embeddings of tokes from NLP
