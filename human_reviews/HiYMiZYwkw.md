# Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders for Domain-Agnostic Self-Supervised Learning

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Self-supervised learning excels in learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled data, demonstrating success across multiple data modalities. Yet, extending self-supervised learning to new modalities is non-trivial because the specifics of existing methods are tailored to each domain, such as domain-specific augmentations which reflect the invariances in the target task. While masked modeling is promising as a domain-agnostic framework for self-supervised learning because it does not rely on input augmentations, its mask sampling procedure remains domain-specific. We present Self-guided Masked Autoencoders (SMA), a fully domain-agnostic masked modeling method. SMA trains an attention based model using a masked modeling objective, by learning masks to sample without any domain-specific assumptions. We evaluate SMA on three self-supervised learning benchmarks in protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics. We find SMA is capable of learning representations without domain-specific knowledge and achieves state-of-the-art performance on these three benchmarks.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a domain-agnostic masked modeling approach for MAE's in the context of self-supervised learning, which can operate across both self and cross-attention architectures as well as different domains. An interesting idea, with a coherent story, and partially promising results.

### Strengths
- The paper reads well, and has a coherent story. 
- The idea is somewhat novel, to my understanding, even though the impact might be marginal compared to a random equivalent. 
- Experiments are elaborate and diverse in different domains, with further supporting results in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
1) I am missing an end-2-end sketch of the proposed architecture. I understand the goal is to keep it somewhat agnostic to task, architecture (self/cross-attention etc), but essential components can still be sketched. Algorithm 1 (which appears by the way too early in the text) to some extent covers this, but not totally.   
2) Am I right to assume (3) - (5) are a mathematical notation of Fig. 1? If so, this is one of those examples where math becomes more of a problem than a solution! 
3) The improvement SMA offers in settings without strong priors (such as protein property prediction, and chemical property prediction) is marginal, which is fine. However, here a simple random masking pattern seems to work pretty well, and that can be an efficient natural choice which is difficult to argue against. (See Tables 1, 2, 3 and 5). 
4) I think it would be useful to have some reflections on the computational complexity (time and/or model space) of SMA. Is it the reason why ImageNet-100 is chosen instead of ImageNet itself?

5) The paper can benefit from another proof read; e.g. here are some minor suggestions:

    a) On page 2: These architectures demonstrates … => Demonstrate

    b) On page 3: Formally for an unlabeled … => Formally, 

    On Page 4: the inputs of a single "group," => “group”, 

    On Page 9: also use resize image … ? Doesn’t read well.

    And several others. 

6) Other suggestions:

    a) I wouldn’t use capital letters for sets (but \mathcal{}) to avoid confusion with a constant value. 

    b) I would avoid using two different l’s for the loss function and for query dimensions.

    c) Clarify the notation of mixed floor/ceiling in (3), in the subsequent paragraph.  

   d) Please refer to table numbers in the text, this way the reader has to look for table content to associate it with descriptions. Table 5 is all of a sudden cited in the text! 

    e) Even though self-explanatory to some extent, the algorithm is left unreferenced and unexplained.

### Questions
1) One can argue masking highlight correlated areas on the input actually poses an easier job to the prediction model no? 

2) Why would repeated top-k(.) operations be too complex or hard to parallelize for different tokens? And why would (3) help to elevate this bottleneck?

3) In Table 1,  why shouldn’t one pick random masking? It seems to function as good as SMA, and the prior art, no? It’s way more efficient as well.

### Summary
The paper introduces the Self-guided Masked Autoencoders (SMA), a domain-agnostic self-supervised learning technique based on masked modeling. Distinguishing itself from traditional self-supervised methods, which often incorporate domain-specific knowledge, the SMA refrains from using any form of tokenizer or making assumptions about the structure of raw inputs. Instead, it dynamically computes masks based on the attention map of the initial encoding layer during masked prediction training. The authors demonstrate SMA's effectiveness across three diverse domains: protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance without relying on domain-specific expertise.

### Strengths
S1 - Domain-Agnostic: 

SMA is designed to be entirely domain-agnostic, ensuring it can be applied widely without needing domain-specific adjustments.

S2 - Dynamic Mask Learning: 

Rather than depending on fixed tokenizers or pre-defined masking strategies, SMA innovatively learns the relationships between raw inputs to determine useful mask sampling.

S3 - Decent Performance on several datasets: On all evaluated benchmarks, SMA not only competes but surpasses the state-of-the-art, indicating its potential as a leading approach in self-supervised learning.

### Weaknesses
W1 Experiments:

While the authors report the results of ImageNet100, the results on the full dataset are also expected to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, I'm also curious about the pre-trained encoder's performance on segmentation and object detection tasks. 

For tabular datasets like HIGGS, the results are promising. However, I'd suggest authors extend the work to broader tabular datasets as the performance of deep learning-based models may vary a lot. Additional experiments are not super expensive in this domain but will give a more comprehensive evaluation. 

 W2 Training and Inference Efficiency:

Authors in this paper claim that the proposed feature space masking is efficient. However, unless I missed it, I failed to see related statistical results/analysis to prove such a claim.

### Questions
The main questions are listed in Weaknesses. I'd raise my score if they were appropriately addressed.

### Summary
This work tackles the problem of domain-agnostic self-supervised learning which does not assume any prior knowledge about the domain itself. The authors propose Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders (SMA) that computes masks based on the attention map of the the model at the first layer. SMA is shown to outperform random masking and other domain-specific baselines on a wide-range of tasks including protein/chemical property prediction, particle physics classification and natural language tasks.

### Strengths
- The problem of domain-agnostic self-supervised learning is an important problem given it’s wide applicability particularly in deep learning for science. The proposed method is simple and elegant.
- The authors show results on a wide-variety of domains with impressive performance without any domain knowledge. It is interesting to see that the results with SMA (without any domain-specific tokenizers) are comparable/better than other methods with domain knowledge.

### Weaknesses
- Missing important related work:
    - DABS [1, 2] is a benchmark for domain agnostic self-supervised learning algorithms. This benchmark consists of semiconductor wafers, multispectral satellite imagery, protein biology, bacterial genomics, particle physics, Speech Recordings, Chest Xrays. DABS also has baselines in the form of Generalized masked autoencoding, Capri (Hybrid Masked-Contrastive Algorithm), e-Mix and Shuffled Embedding Detection (ShED). Demonstrating the effectiveness of SMA on this benchmark would strengthen the paper. I understand that the authors have already shown results on particle physics and protein datasets but comparing with these baselines would lead to a more complete results section. The authors can also discuss and compare SMA with these baselines.
    - The authors should compare and contrast with related literature [3, 4, 5].
- The authors can run some ablations to better understand the proposed method, SMA. For instance, how does the masking ratio impact performance in various domains? It may be interesting to analyze the performance if the masks are computed in second/ third layer (or any kth layer) instead of first layer in all the experiments.

### Questions
1. What are the hyperparameters in SMA? Is masking ratio the only hyperparameter? Can the authors explain why certain domains require a high masking rate compared to others (as mentioned in Table 7 to 11)
2. How would the performance differ if a domain-specific tokenizer is used in Chemical property prediction?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new mechanism called Self-Guided Masked Autoencoders (SMA), that acts as a generic masking procedure in the embedding space, and is therefore agnostic to the nature of the input data. SMA is evaluated on a wide variety of tasks ranging from molecular and chemical property prediction tasks, to image classification and NLP tasks. A reasonable level of performance is demonstrated without domain-specific data augmentations throughout the tasks.

### Strengths
1) The idea of generic masking in the self-attention layers directly is novel and promising. Generic masking was explored previously with the data2vec models but here the mechanism seems to be more principled and applicable to any domain using transformers.

2) The initial results on various tasks without domain-specific data augmentation is encouraging and might lead with further exploration to general and principled architectures for self-supervised learning on any kind of data.

3) The results on biology and chemistry tasks are convincing and competitive with prior work.

### Weaknesses
1) The results on image classification and NLP tasks are only on toy datasets and seem to be too preliminary to convince people from these communities to try the approach. The gains are marginal and only a small set of methods are compared. The final model is far from the state-of-the-art in NLP and vision. I would recommend if possible to be more ambitious and demonstrate results on more large scale tasks such as linear evaluation on ImageNet.

2) Some design choices are not well motivated and should be ablated properly. For example masking ratios, number k of elements in Eq.3

### Questions
1) How do you tune the masking parameters, such as the number of queries and input to mask ? (masking ratio) How difficult is it ?

2) Do you need to mask queries ? Could you simply mask the input randomly ? Could you clarify if this corresponds to “Random Masking” in your tables ?

### Summary
This paper presented a Self-Guided Masked Autoencoder for domain-agnostic SSL, with experiments largely focusing on data from scientific domains such as biology, chemistry, and physics. It selects tokens to mask via attention maps from the first encoding layer (either self-attention or cross-attention) and masks the tokens with high aggregated attention weights. The authors argue that such an approach masks highly correlated semantic regions regardless of domain priors. The authors show strong results in protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics.

This paper works on an interesting topic with great potential impact and it is clearly written; however, the paper slightly lacks quality, therefore the reviewer recommends a borderline rejection.

### Strengths
Originality: the method is inspired by Perceiver (Jaegle 2021b) and adapted the latent query technique to the attention module in masked autoencoder. Although the method is not particularly novel, the reviewer reckons that this is the first work to improve MAE’s domain-agnostic property via attention-map-based mask selection. There are other mask selection works, but they are primarily domain-specific [1, 2].

Clarity: the paper has a good flow and is, in general, easy to read.

Significance: domain-agnostic SSL is an important research topic as the community is seeing the merging of multi-domain, multi-modality pretraining. This paper serves as a nice step forward in this direction by using a generic attention-based mask selection technique for MAE pre-training.

### Weaknesses
Post-rebuttal update: the responses include new experimental comparisons and successfully address all of the reviewer's concerns. Therefore, the reviewer updated the rating.

------

Originality: the paper did not cite or compare other domain-agnostic SSL methods, either contrastive [3] or masking [4]. Also, the key components, latent query tokens (Jaegle 2021b) and the KeepTopK (Shazeer et al. 2017) are not novel, further weakening the originality of this work.

Quality: the quality of this work is lacking. Empirical performance improvement can be limited, such as results for the MoleculeNet (Table 2), where the proposed method is sometimes worse than the baseline method (BACE and HIV of Uni-Mol-20M), or improvement can seem limited (Lipo). While a lower performance is common, since there are only limited baselines (TabNet for the HIGGS benchmark and baselines for the HIGGS benchmark are all from 2021 or prior) and this work is quite empirical, the performance difference can seem noticeable. Nevertheless, the reviewer is not familiar with the benchmarks and did not extensively search for new work with higher results, and will hugely benefit from a response from the authors explaining why the baselines are few. 

Clarity: some parts of the paper seem confusing; the details are in the Questions section.

### Questions
1. Page 5, “First, because the top attention tokens chosen for each query have significant overlap, we often do not actually mask the target masking ratio, and this issue worsens as $n$ increases.“
* How much overlap did the top attention tokens have? Did the authors quantify them? How does this issue worsen as $n$ increases – a log or linear relationship?

2. Page 5, “...while achieving the desired masking ratio and parallelizing well.”
* Unfortunately, there are no follow-up experiments or discussions on better parallelization. Why is this the case, and how much parallelization improvement does the proposed method bring?

3. Page 5, “let $\mathcal{P}$ represent the set of all permutations of indices” and Eq.(1).
* If $p$ is a permutation, what does $pX^{(i)}$ mean in Eq.(1)? And more importantly, why Eq.(1) defines domain-agnostic? It is not clear as there are no direct citations or proof supporting this claim (the Perceiver paper did not seem to include any specific math statement like this). The reviewer would appreciate more explanation on this part.
