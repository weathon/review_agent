## Abstract
Seminal research in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs) has revealed a direct correspondence between the expressive capabilities of GNNs and the $k$-dimensional 
Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$WL) test, a widely-recognized method for verifying graph isomorphism. This connection has reignited interest in comprehending the specific graph properties effectively distinguishable by the $k$WL test.
A central focus of research in this field revolves around determining the least dimensionality $k$, for which $k$WL can discern graphs with different number of occurrences of a pattern graph $p$. We refer to such a least $k$ as the WL-dimension of this pattern counting problem. This inquiry traditionally delves into two distinct counting problems related to patterns: subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting. Intriguingly, despite their initial appearance as separate challenges with seemingly divergent approaches, both of these problems are interconnected components of a more comprehensive problem: "graph motif parameters". In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the WL-dimension of labeled graph motif parameters. As specific instances of this result, we obtain characterizations of the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting problem for every labeled pattern $p$. Particularly noteworthy is our resolution of a problem left open in previous work 
concerning induced copies.
We additionally demonstrate that in cases where the $k$WL test distinguishes between graphs with varying occurrences of a pattern $p$, the exact number of occurrences of $p$ can be computed uniformly using only local information of the last layer of a corresponding GNN.
We finally delve into the challenge of recognizing the WL-dimension of various graph parameters. We give a polynomial time algorithm for determining the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting problem for given pattern $p$, answering an open question from previous work.
We additionally show how to utilize deep results from the field of graph motif parameters, together with our characterization, to determine the WL-dimension of induced subgraph counting and counting $k$-graphlets.

### Summary
The WL test for graph isomorphism is an iterative message-passing-like process on a graph, where in each round the nodes share structural information accumulated in previous rounds with their adjacent nodes. In recent years it has been studied in connection to the expressibility of graph neural networks. This paper studies the higher dimensional variant k-WL, where instead of nodes the information is passed between k-tuples of nodes. This variant has been associated with "higher-order GNNs", a generalization GNNs where correspondingly, messages are passed between sets of nodes. The paper is theoretical and proves some results about the "WL dimension" of graph substructures, which is the smallest k such the k-WL test can distinguish between graphs that have a different number of copies of that substructure. The results concern to variants like induced versus non-induced substructures, whether the number of copies can be computed, and whether the WL dimension of a substructures can be computed efficiently.

### Strengths
The WL test has gotten a lot of focus in the DL community due to its connections to GNN, and this line of literature is by now standard in the ICLR community, and this paper furthers this line of research by proving additional new results.

### Weaknesses
This seems generally like a combinatorics paper and it corresponds mostly with the combinatorics and not the ML literature. The connection between WL and GNNs is well-established by now, but the direction taken in this paper does not seem directly relevant to GNNs, but rather related mostly indirectly just due to generally being about WL. There is only fleeting reference to why any of the questions studied here bear on GNNs (and even then they concern the rather niche "higher-order" k-GNNs and not standard GNNs). Even though it is in scope for GNN-related venues and particularly ICLR, it is not all that clear that ICLR is where this paper would actually find its interested readership.

### Summary
This paper studies the power of the k-Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) algorithm for the natural and fundamental task of computing graph motif parameters (a weighted combination of subgraph counts). The motivation for studying the k-WL test is the connection to the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs).

Building on recent results for unlabeled graphs, this paper characterizes the class of graph motifs that can be computed by the k-WL test for labeled graphs (i.e., with edge and vertex labels). A central quantity is the WL-dimension of the graph motif parameter $\Gamma$, which is the smallest $k$ for which a k-WL test returns distinct outputs for graphs which induce distinct values of $\Gamma$. In Theorem 2, the authors show that the WL-dimension of $\Gamma$ is equal to the maximum treewidth of any of the subgraphs in the support of $\Gamma$. In Theorem 6, the authors show that the result of the WL test can be used to compute the value of $\Gamma$ as well (alone, the $k$-WL can only distinguish between different values of $\Gamma$). In their final set of results, the authors turn to the more specific question of subgraph counting. Theorem 8 shows that it can be determined whether a labeled graph has WL-dimension at most $k$ in polynomial time. Proposition 9 examines the popular task of counting graphlets, and shows that counting k-graphlets has WL-dimension k - 1.

### Strengths
This work extends recent results on the $k$-WL algorithm to the setting of labeled graphs. This is an important conceptual extension, as many graphs do have additional information that can be taken into account for learning tasks. Technical details are clear and seem correct. 

The authors' results have clear implications for the ability of GNNs to compute subgraph counts. Together, Theorems 2, 6 and 8 show that one can determine an appropriate value of $k$ in polynomial time for the motif-counting task at hand, and can then compute it using a modification of the k-WL test. This is quite useful and may impact how one designs GNNs for these kinds of tasks.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty of this work isn't clear to me. While the extension to labeled graphs is well-motivated, the results and techniques seem to be obtained by simple / straightforward extensions of recent work for unlabeled graphs. Can you describe what the key roadblocks and innovations are in this setting? This would make it easier to judge the contributions of this work.
- No numerical experiments, but given that this is a theoretical paper, this is only a mild weakness. 
- What are the implications for GNN design for various tasks, based on the results in your paper? These are only hinted at, but given the audience of this paper, it would be worthwhile to have some discussion about it.

### Questions
- Is $homs(F_i, G)$ defined somewhere?
- In the definition of tree decomposition on page 5, do you mean to write $\{u,v \} \subseteq \alpha(t)$?
- Is there any quick intuition for why treewidth is the right determinant of the WL-dimension?

### Confidence

### Summary
This work studies the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of graph motif parameters for labeled graphs, i.e. the size of $k$ needed for $k$WL to distinguish these parameters. They show that this is exactly the maximum treewidth of the graphs in the support of the parameter. This solves several problems left open or unaddressed in recent work.

### Strengths
1. Uses results from, extends, and solves unsolved problems from very recent work on kWL and graph motif parameters.
2. Strong, elegant, general result on graph motif parameters, which allows application to many graph problems of interest, such as induced subgraph counting.

Due to these nice and timely theoretical results, I recommend acceptance of the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. Hard to understand introduction of first-order logic concepts
2. Unclear utility of results in machine learning: see questions section for notes on Section 4.

### Questions
Perhaps results from permutation-invariant function representation can be used to give a simpler proof of Theorem 6? It is known that multiset functions $f$ can be sum-decomposed in certain situations. For instance, [Zaheer et al. 2017] show that continuous permutation invariant functions $f$ from $[0, 1]^n \to \mathbb{R}$ (which can be viewed as functions on multisets of $n$ elements) can be written as $f(X) = \rho( \sum_{i=1}^n \phi(X_i))$ for some continuous functions $\rho$ and $\phi$. This motivates the common form of "readout" functions in GNNs, i.e. permutation invariant functions mapping from $k$-tuple representations to a single representation for the graph. In fact, from previous work I would already expect to see a result like yours; it is unclear whether your result is useful for practical GNNs, since one would already build a readout function in this form.

### Summary
The connection between the WL algorithm and the expressive power of GNNs is well-established in GNN literature. The paper conducts a theoretical study of the power and limitations of k-WL algorithm in context of counting patterns in graphs, more generally graph motif parameters. The authors provide a precise characterization of which labeled graph motif parameters are determined by the k-WL type of a graph. Some of these results concern induced versions of subgraph counting. Finally, the authors give a polynomial time algorithm that given a pattern P finds the minimum k such that k-WL determines P-counts.

### Strengths
The paper is a neat collection of results on pattern counting, which should be useful to the GNN community. The paper is extremely well-written and the exposition is very structured.

### Weaknesses
I am not convinced so much with the novelty of results, especially in light of the recent results such as Neuen (2023). The contributions are kind of incremental in my opinion. It would have been useful to have some experimental work to accompany the paper: e.g. Is it harder to compute labeled patterns using GNNs, instead of unlabeled patterns? Or perhaps, the performance of models using random node initialization could be explained by the ability of GNNs to count labeled patterns?

### Questions
1) Comment: Typically in homomorphism literature, a "labeled graph" refers to a graph with certain vertices marked with labels 1,...,k. That is, a k-labeled graph comes along with a mapping $\ell:[k] \to V(G)$. This is different from the more general notion considered in the paper. It would be advisable to make this distinction somewhere in the paper for readability across communities.
