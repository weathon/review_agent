## Abstract
Ensuring data privacy and protection has become paramount in the era of deep learning. Unlearnable examples are proposed to mislead the deep learning models and prevent data from unauthorized exploration by adding small perturbations to data. However, such perturbations (e.g., noise, texture, color change) predominantly impact low-level features, making them vulnerable to countermeasures like adversarial training, data augmentations, and preprocessing. In contrast, semantic images with intricate shapes have a wealth of high-level features, making them more resilient to countermeasures and potential for producing robust unlearnable examples. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hiding (DH) scheme that adaptively hides semantic images enriched with high-level features. We employ an Invertible Neural Network (INN) to invisibly integrate predefined images, inherently hiding them with deceptive perturbations. To enhance data unlearnability, we introduce a Latent Feature Concentration module, designed to work with the INN, regularizing the intra-class variance of these perturbations. To further boost the robustness of unlearnable examples, we design a Semantic Images Generation module that produces hidden semantic images. By utilizing similar semantic information, this module generates similar semantic images for samples within the same classes, thereby enlarging the inter-class distance and narrowing the intra-class distance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-subset, against 12 countermeasures, reveal that our proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art ro- bustness for unlearnable examples, demonstrating its efficacy in data protection.

### Summary
The majority of existing methods for generating Unlearnable Examples primarily focus on investigating the robustness against adversarial training, while overlooking the resilience to other attack strategies such as data augmentation and preprocessing. Previous research has found that images containing semantic information are robust against common attacks. In this paper, the authors propose a novel defense mechanism that is effective under various prevalent attack methods. The authors first generate multiple image samples corresponding to the number of categories using ControlNet, and then employ Image Hiding techniques to conceal the generated image samples within the dataset to be protected, utilizing Invertible Neural Networks (INN). This process disrupts the original semantic information of the images, thereby achieving the goal of protecting the data.

### Strengths
- The authors introduce Image Hiding techniques into Data Unlearning, providing a new reference direction for the field of Data Unlearning.
- The authors employ a Latent Feature Concentration module during the image hiding process to achieve consistency in semantic features within the same class, thus allowing the features of similar data to become more concentrated.
- The selection of attack methods for the experiments in this paper is fairly comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
- The method consists of three modules: The Deep Hiding Scheme, which introduces the concept of Image Hiding, an existing work; the Semantic Image Generation Module, which utilizes the existing ControlNet; and the Latent Feature Concentration Module, which is very similar to the idea of EntF mentioned in the related work. In summary, the ideas presented in this paper are intriguing, but the innovation is insufficient.
- Previous research has shown that some Unlearnable Examples possess an inherent resistance to data augmentation, which contradicts the paper's claim that prior methods have overlooked these issues.
- In the experimental settings of the paper, the perturbation for adversarial training is set to $8/255$, and the perturbation for protection noise also appears to be set to $8/255$ according to the experimental table. Under this setting, which is consistent with EntF, the paper's experiments lack a comparison with this method.
- The paper doesn't explain why it's also effective under adversarial training.

Although the introduction of Image hiding in the paper is interesting, the three important parts of the article are existing work and lack innovation. In addition, there is a lack of comparison of EntF methods, a lack of inquiry about defense against training, and a lack of inquiry about the effect of the generated hiding image on protection. All in all, at this point in time, I would recommend this paper as weak reject.

### Summary
This paper focuses on methods for generating unlearnable samples. The paper takes the unique perspective of deep hiding and improves based on existing deep hiding methods, which consequently proposes new methods for generating unlearnable samples. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and has clear figures.

2. The paper proposed methods for generating unlearnable samples from such an interesting perspective as deep hiding.

3. The experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness and robustness of the method proposed in the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The comparison experiments do not show the relationship between the scale of the perturbations generated by the proposed method and the comparison method, and the size of the generated perturbations cannot be fully controlled by $L_{hide}$ alone, because there are other losses included in the total loss.

2. An ablation experiment on the semantic image generation module is missing to demonstrate its advantages compared with randomly selected hidden images.

### Questions
1. There is a backward revealing process for the INN-based hiding model used in the paper, but what is the significance of the existence of this process?

2. The paper proposed a concentration loss (Eq. 7), and how are sample i and sample j selected in the specific implementation?


======================After rebuttal===================

The authors' response address most of my concerns. Thus I am willing to increase the rating score to 6.


======================Update after discussion===================

After discussion, I agree with reviewer Naq4. For data with larger resolution, while it contains more information that needs to be protected, there are also more features that can be used to hide critical content. However, the proposed method seems to be limited on more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet-subset). Thus, I think the current work needs further improvements to meet the acceptance criteria.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel method to generate robust unlearnable examples by hiding semantic images within clean images using invertible neural networks (INNs). This introduces perturbations to mislead classifiers while leveraging semantic features that are robust to countermeasures. A Latent Feature Concentration (LFC) module regularizes the intra-class variance of perturbations. A Semantic Images Generation module creates hidden images with consistent semantics within a class to maximize inter-class separation. Experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art unlearnability and robustness against data augmentations and preprocessing.

### Strengths
1. Novel deep hiding scheme to generate unlearnable examples by hiding semantic images using INNs. 

2. Introduces LFC module to regularize intra-class variance of perturbations.  

3. Introduces Semantic Image Generation module to maximize inter-class separation. 

4. State-of-the-art results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets against various countermeasures.

### Weaknesses
1. Additional Requirements of generating a large dataset of semantic images using paired text prompts and canny edge maps. 

2. The sample-wise setting may leak information about hidden images. If some hackers know an image is protected in this way, they may find a countermeasure for the unlearnable examples based on the proposed hidden semantic generations.  

3. A pre-trained ResNet-18 is used as the feature extractor, all text prompts are clustered using K-means with the semantic features from the CLIP model, and Stable Diffusion model and ControlNet to generate semantic images. It's hard to analyze the effectiveness of each component.  

4. From the above, the connection between the hidden image and the unlearnable example is unclear. The hidden semantic image may not directly contribute to unlearnability.  

5. The robustness and effectiveness may come from the pre-trained ResNet-18, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, or ControlNet. Therefore, the effectiveness and robustness may not come from the architecture and the idea; instead, these may only come from the extra information from the four pre-trained models.  

6. Although an LFC (a pretrained ResNet18) is used to regularize intra-class variance, and the CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and ControlNet are used to maximize inter-class separation, the author should consider the alignment between these pretrained models.  

7. Although Grad-CAM is used to visualize the attention of DNNs, the intra-class and inter-class relationship with the classification and semantic generation should be more fully exploited. Evaluating the inter-class and intra-class statistics directly could also substantiate the claims around controlled semantics, see questions.

### Questions
On page 4, the paper mentions the previous work lacks semantic high-level features and redundancy. However, I don’t know how redundancy is solved in this work.  

There are some ablation experiments that remove each major component would indeed provide better insights into their individual contributions: 

1. Using clean images from different classes as hidden semantic images, or using random natural images as hidden semantic images, rather than generated ones. As you noted, this removes the control over the consistency of semantics within a class. The drop in unlearnability can show the importance of controlled generation. 

2. Removing the Latent Feature Concentration (LFC) module. This would demonstrate the impact of the proposed module in regularizing intra-class perturbations. 

3. Removing the CLIP-based clustering of text prompts. Using random prompts for generation removes controlled inter-class differences. 

4. Evaluating inter-class and intra-class separation quantitatively using metrics like mean intra-class distance and mean inter-class distance. This can formally validate the claims.

### Summary
The paper presents an approach to generate unlearnable examples by hiding the semantic images in the natural images. To hide the semantic images, DWT along with INN has been used. The loss functions are combined to ensure a frequency image is close to the natural image and only high-frequency features are disturbed. The experiments are performed on multiple datasets and the resiliency of the proposed approach is also demonstrated.

### Strengths
The paper presents straightforward unlearnable examples generation algorithms.
The generated examples are robust to several defense strategies.

### Weaknesses
* The paper can bring the hiding process into the main text in comparison to adding it to the supplementary file.
* The experimental section of the paper is weak. The ablation studies with several parameters used in the proposed algorithm are missing. For example: ablation concerning the role of individual loss items, concerning values of $w_i$.
* The authors have mentioned that $100$ semantic images are generated for image hiding. Are these all $100$ images used and how?
* Why the existing algorithms are re-implemented? Are they implemented and fine-tuned using the parameters provided in the papers? can't we use the protocols of existing work for direct comparisons?
* Any reason why *JPEG10* is yielding significantly higher robustness across each unlearnable example? Any explainable reason for this and have the authors tried with a lower **JEPG** value?
* have the authors studied the transferability of the proposed examples in the presence of defenses?
* It is surprising to see that even at 80\%, the test accuracy is significantly high (84.40\%), which suddenly drops to 10.00\% in presence of 100\% examples. Am I correct? If yes, what is the reason?
* What about transferability in terms of limited samples used to learn unlearnable examples?
* The paper also needs to discuss existing contemporary image-hiding works effective in generating adversarial examples and how they are different from this work. Why they can not be used as compared to the proposed DH?
