# Zero-shot Clustering of Embeddings with Pretrained and Self-Supervised Learning Encoders

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 1, 3, 5

## Abstract
In this work, we explore whether pretrained models can provide a useful representation space for datasets they were not trained on, and whether these representations can be used to group novel unlabelled data into meaningful clusters. To this end, we conduct experiments using image representation encoders pretrained on ImageNet using either supervised or self-supervised training techniques. These encoders are deployed on image datasets that were not seen during training, and we investigate whether their embeddings can be clustered with conventional clustering algorithms. We find that it is possible to create well-defined clusters using self-supervised feature encoders, especially when using the agglomerative clustering method, and that it is possible to do so even for very fine-grained datasets such as iNaturalist. We also find indications that the Silhouette score is a good proxy of cluster quality for self-supervised feature encoders when no ground truth is available.

### Summary
The authors analyze the performance of unsupervised clustering on the feature space of five self-supervised learning methods (one for each major SSL paradigm) and a supervised learning baseline. Two architectures for feature extraction and five clustering techniques. Each possible combination of these three aspects (training method, clustering technique and backbone network) is tested on 10 datasets with varying levels of classification granularity; clustering performance is evaluated through adjusted mutual information and the silhouette score.

### Strengths
- The writing is easy to follow
- This analysis has not been done before and will be of good use for the community of practitioners looking into clustering methods for pre-trained feature spaces
- Names the concept "Zero-shot Clustering", which while not being a new idea (most clustering methods are by themselves zero-shot) it is helpful to differentiate from representation learners within-domain.
- The test on correlation between silhouette and adjusted mutual information makes a strong case for starting data analysis from clusterization in unsupervised applications.

### Weaknesses
- This is the first instance of the "zero shot clustering" task, yet the task has not been formally defined in the manuscript. A formal definition should for example define that the class sets between the feature extractor's training set and the set being clustered as disjoint; this is important to avoid problems like the unfairness of comparing CLIP embeddings on equal grounds.
- On a related/followup note: Including comparisons against CLIP on the same grounds is unfair to other feature extractors and detracts from the "zero-shot" nature of the task. Because it is not possible to determine if the classes (or even the samples themselves) were present the the CLIP training set, the results on CLIP should be included as extra information and treated as such. The current discussion is hindered by comparing against CLIP directly as readers are not able to properly judge the quality of the feature extractor's generalization.
- The hyper parameter sweep (second stage) considers parameters only for Agglomerative Clustering (AC), with only HDBSCAN also getting any parameter evaluation (albeit for a single parameter choice). K-means could have it's distance metric changed as well as have an alternative formulation with automatic K (elbow method or even using silhouette score itself). Affinity Propagation also has hyper parameters that could be candidate for a sweep. The lack of experimentation with the other clustering methods raises concerns regarding the final results as AC ends up being the recommended method. 

Other notes:
- First paragraph is missing a period.
- Default parameters may change over time on packages such as scikit-learn. It is better to include all of the necessary information for reproduction (either on th main manuscript or on a supplementary material file).
- Figure 1 and 2 are hard to read due to change in order. It might also help to include the actual average ranking number on the plot.
- Sec. 4.1: authors did not mention which findings from Vaze et al. are corroborated (include the insight instead of only the result) 
- Conclusion: Performance was not equal or comparable on fine-grained datasets

### Questions
1. Excluding CLIP, what would the authors recommend between using CNN or Transformer-based architectures? It is important to consider that a ViT-B is not computationally comparable to a ResNet50 (which is lighter by 3~4x in FLOPs and parameters).

## Human Reviewer 2

### Rating
1: strong reject

### Rating Number
1

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This work explores the image clustering ability of pretrained model. The study focus on 6 supervised/self-supervised methods with ViT-B and ResNet-50.

### Strengths
- The experiments are somewhat extensive, covering a range of different models and datasets.

### Weaknesses
- Is the testing set truly out-of-distribution? For a lot of the dataset tested, it heavily overlap with ImageNet images or CLIP training images. I think it is ok to say "the work benchmarked a lot of datasets" but it is not accurate to say "the work benchmarked a lot of out-of-distribution datasets"

- The metric used. There has been a long-standing image clustering and deep image clustering community (e.g.https://github.com/zhoushengisnoob/DeepClustering) that measures the accuracy of clustering directly. This has became the most important metric to measure clustering performance. 

- Is this work truly the **first** investigation into zero-shot clustering of SSL feature?: Since 2020, there has been lots of work focusing on image-clustering based on a pretrained (SSL) image encoder. The papers have shown that (1) zero-shot clustering can have non-trivial performance (similar to the result of this paper) (2) Performance can be further improved with different finetuning methods. I think it is important to acknowledge the previous works and reconsider the novelty of this work. 

- Some issues with definition and terminology: CLIP is not self-supervised, it is rather supervised/language-supervised/weakly-supervised.
MoCo/DINO/VICReg have a lot in common. Last year's ICLR best paper candidate has shown a strong duality between the methods, so it would be more accurate to just say they are contrastive. 

- Writing and Presentation: I think the work can be improved a lot, with the current format.

## Human Reviewer 3

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
- The paper considers the task of "zero-shot clustering" of feature embeddings from pretrained SSL networks, viz. MoCov3, DINO, VICReg, MAE, and CLIP
- It considers multiple clustering methods, K-means, Agglomerative clustering, Affinity Propagation, HDBSCAN and performs an extensive hyperparameter search on various hyperparameters
- The paper evaluates the performance of all these methods on each encoder for various datasets, like ImageNet-1K, CIFAR, iNaturalist-21, etc. and evaluates performance via AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information) which needs labels and Silhouette Scores, which doesn't require ground-truth labels
- The paper finds which encoders work the best with ResNet-50 and ViT-B architectures and which clustering methods perform the best -- MoCo-v3 for ResNet-50 and CLIP for ViT-B, with Agglomerative clustering performing the best
- Lastly, the paper shows that AMI and silhouette scores are well correlated, meaning that silhouette scores can be used as a good metric to evaluate how the clustering performs without having ground truth information

### Strengths
- The paper shows an extensive evaluation of clustering methods on various SSL methods and compares it to supervised and CLIP models
- It provides a good analysis of which methods are best for clustering, which clustering methods to use, and how to evaluate these even in the absence of ground truth labels
- The paper is well written and easy to read. The results are clear and easy to interpret.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is primarily a vast hyperparameter search of {pretrained models, clustering method, clustering hyperparams, eval datasets} and an analysis of the results. While the results are useful to use as a reference to pick the best models + clustering methods for a particular task, I fail to see any impactful research contributions. The analysis of correlation between AMI and Silhouette score is useful, but again not strong enough to warrant acceptance 
- The results in Figure 1 and 2, especially Figure 1, have very wide error bars, meaning that the comparisons wouldn't be statistically significant. This is probably because of the use of the rank metric -- it would be better to see an aggregated performance metric which isn't as sensitive (like an average), resulting in some statistically significant results
- Minor: In the Introduction, the paper mentions "while the embeddings from an SSL-trained feature extractor can perform well on downstream tasks after fine-tuning the network, there has been little investigation into the utility of the embeddings without fine-tuning the network" -- this is inaccurate, SSL methods have been extensively evaluated without finetuning via k-nearest neighbours and linear probing while keeping the encoder frozen (e.g. MoCov3, DINO).
- Minor: the paper considers CLIP as a self-supervised method, whereas it is typically considered a weakly supervised method since the texts provide noisy supervision.

### Questions
- I am overall unsure what the rebuttal can show which can add research contributions to the paper. As of now, it seems like a study of clustering methods on SSL encoders. A study can also have interesting research observations / contributions but currently the paper seems like a simple description of the observations without any further analyses. Here's a few things which come to mind but I am still not sure if they'll be enough:
  - It would be interesting to see a connection between clustering scores and traditional SSL evaluations like k-NN, linear probes, or finetuned results -- do these move together in unison or are the clustering capabilities of a model's representations relatively unrelated to other evaluations?
  - Why does agglomerative clustering perform well, or what makes certain methods perform better? Why does changing the architecture change the rank ordering?

### Summary
The paper presents an empirical study on zero-shot clustering utilizing SSL pre-trained models. The study encompasses analysis on 10 representative datasets, focusing on 5 prevalent pre-training paradigms (MoCo, DINO, VICReg, MAE, and CLIP) with ReNet and ViT backbones. The findings reveal insightful tendencies, such as the potential of contrastive and multi-modal SSL models in generating meaningful clusters. The paper is interesting in general, but some major issues should be addressed.

### Strengths
1. The paper serves as the pioneering investigation into zero-shot clustering of SSL feature encoders.
2. The experimental design is comprehensive, encompassing diverse datasets, pre-trained models, and clustering methods.
3. The experimental results yield valuable insights into zero-shot clustering, providing valuable guidance for future model development.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper addresses the concept of zero-shot clustering, an important subject in machine learning. However, there is a need for a clearer definition of the zero-shot clustering problem. Additionally, the paper should thoroughly review and discuss related topics, such as transfer learning or unsupervised domain adaptation, for a comprehensive understanding.
2. In Section 3, further elaboration is required on the training process of the supervised model. It would be beneficial to include a table outlining different SSL models and their respective configurations for enhanced clarity.
3. In order to ensure a fair comparison, the paper should consider comparing deep models initialized with random weights, as in many cases, random mapping can yield clustering results that surpass those of raw data.
4. While the paper highlights the improved performance of clustering methods with pre-trained models, it lacks an exploration of the underlying reasons for this phenomenon.
5. Visual comparisons, such as t-SNE plots, are essential in the experiment to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
6. The paper mentioned dimension reduction in the experiment but did not discuss the effect of them.
