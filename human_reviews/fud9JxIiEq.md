- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)

## Abstract
We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

### Summary
This paper proposes using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the reverse transition kernel within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework. The author proposes to match the first and second-order moments of DDPM forward marginals and design three different schemes to compute GMM parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of conditionally generated and unconditionally generated samples.

### Strengths
+ The authors provide mathematical proof that the GMM-based sampling algorithm can be used for models obtained by DDPM training.
+ The proposed method performs better in both conditional and unconditional generation than the DDIM method.

### Weaknesses
+ The motivation for this paper is confusing; why use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and what are the benefits of such an assumption?
+ The experiment is weak and only compared the DDIM method as a baseline, but other methods for improved sampling (e.g. DPM-Solver[1]) are not compared. Meanwhile, since DDIM is an ODE-based method, the relationship between DDIM-GMM and ODE should also be discussed

+ The authors do not consider the additional computational cost associated with GMM; this computational effort compared to the number of samples should be discussed.

### Questions
Please see the weaknesses. 
In addition, Since the authors in their article state that the DDIM-GMM method is equivalent to DDPM in terms of the forward process, only the weight of the loss is different. There are some related works [1,2] that show that this weight has an effect on the diffusion model, the authors may try to design the loss function for training based on the GMM sampling assumption.

### Summary
This paper introduced a Mixture of Gaussian kernels to the DDIM sampling process. This work proposes three sampling methods that satisfy the constraints on the GMM kernel weights to perform DDIM sampling aligned with the marginal of the pre-trained DDPM using the GMM kernel.
Compared to the DDIM using the Gaussian kernel, the proposed method sometimes leads to better performance with a few sampling steps.

### Strengths
* The proposed method can represent transitions with more parameters at each transition than DDIM with a Gaussian kernel. Without additional training, the method can affordably enhance the expressiveness over the Gaussian kernel by adding parameters.

### Weaknesses
* **Limited novelty.** It is an incremental approach to the DDIM sampling method w/ a Gaussian kernel. It only shows a comparison with DDIM w/ a Gaussian kernel, without performance comparisons with other methods.

* **Marginal improvement.** Looking at the FID and IS results in Figures 1, 2, and 3, and the tables in the Appendix, the performance improvement over DDIM is marginal. The proposed method only shows a slight performance improvement at fewer sampling steps (around 10 steps) where DDIM w/ a Gaussian kernel struggles. As the number of samplings increases, there is no performance difference compared to the baseline. The qualitative results in Figure 8 also fail to demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the baseline.

* Lack of analysis on the number of mixtures in GMM or the weights for each mixture.

### Questions
* This method can be applied to any pre-trained diffusion model, just like DDIM w/ a Gaussian kernel. Does this sampling method using GMM have advantages in applications like Text-to-Image generation than the baseline? 

* When DDIM w/ a Gaussian kernel shows good performance (e.g. 100+ sampling steps), can the proposed method bring more than just a marginal improvement in performance, even at a higher number of sampling steps?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel sampling scheme for a pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The authors investigate a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), in place of a univariate Gaussian, within the reverse transition kernels of the DDIM generative process. To choose the additional GMM parameters, a moment matching technique is suitably applied with theoretical grounding. The use of GMM results in improved FIDs and ISs when taking small numbers of sampling steps.

### Strengths
Taking advantage of GMM in DDIM sampling appears to be a sensible approach, and is presumably more capable than a unimodal Gaussian. The main hurdle of using GMM would be the increased complexity and the lack of parameters learning schemes. The highlighted contribution of this paper is to provide a feasible moment matching approach for choosing GMM parameters. As far as I checked, this technique is technically sound.

### Weaknesses
The main problem of this paper would be clarity.

- There are numerous ill-defined variables and formulas in the main paper, which, to a large extent, hinder readers' understanding. This current presentation is kind of poor that I struggle to read all the derivation in the main paper and the appendix. I suggest to **bold** all vectors and matrices, following the usual practice of ICLR papers, to differentiate them from scalars. For example, in Eq. (9), it is very hard tell how $O_t$ could possibly subtract $\bar{o}_t$, when the former is a matrix and the latter is a vector. 

- The organization of section 3.1 is also confusing. I suppose the authors try to provide three choices of method for selecting the GMM parameters. However, three methods just appear without much explanation and any reference to the previous works on GMM. From the experiment results, I prefer to a more condense presentation on the DDIM-GMM-ORTHO-VUB solution, while the discussion on DDIM-GMM-RAND and DDIM-GMM-ORTHO can be moved to the Appendix for ablation studies.

- The experimental results in section 4 are very unclear. The performance differences in Figure 1-7 are basically not noticeable. While these figures occupy about 1.5 pages of the main paper, their provided information might be less than two table (one for CelebAHQ and FFHQ; one for ImageNet). The current presentation of results is so ineffective that I cannot find any significant improvement against the original DDIM sampling approach.

### Summary
This paper proposes a variant of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM), wherein a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed as the reverse transition kernel, replacing the Gaussian model. The authors derive constraints for the GMM, ensuring that the first and second central moments of the forward marginal distributions match those of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Utilizing these constraints, the authors deduce the upper bound of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) and adopt it as the training loss, resulting in an augmented version of the DDPM loss.

### Strengths
-The paper proposes a variant of DDIM, utilizing a Gaussian Mixture Model as the reverse transition kernel.
- The paper suggests that moment matching is sufficient for producing samples of equal or superior quality compared to the original DDIM.
- The presentation is clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- DDIM is typically employed with $\eta=0$. Although the proposed method appears to significantly enhance the performance of the original DDIM when $\eta\neq 0$, numerical results suggest that its performance is generally inferior compared to DDIM with $\eta=0$. For instance, in Fig. 1, the FID scores range from 25 to 35 when $\eta=0$ and the number of steps is 10, whereas they range from 60 to 70 when $\eta=1.0$ and the number of steps is 10. Furthermore, as the number of steps increases beyond 10, the performance difference between DDIM ($\eta=0$) and DDIM-GMM becomes almost negligible.
- What are the values of $\eta$ used in the figures where the generated samples are displayed? The visual assessment of the sampling results makes it difficult to qualitatively determine which method produces better quality. In scenarios with 10 steps, both methods frequently result in deformed structures, and at 100 steps, it becomes challenging to definitively decide which method delivers superior quality. I am uncertain about its practical utility.

### Questions
- How do the results compare when the proposed method is tested under the experimental settings provided in the DDIM paper [1], specifically on the CIFAR10, Bedroom, Church, and CelebA datasets?
- Why were sampled images from the unconditional model not included in the presentation?
- How does the performance of the proposed method compare to the generalized version of DDIM suggested in [2]?
