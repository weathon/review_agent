## Abstract
Diffusion models (DMs) demonstrate potent image generation capabilities in various generative modeling tasks. Nevertheless, their primary limitation lies in slow sampling speed, requiring hundreds or thousands of sequential function evaluations through large neural networks to generate high-quality images. Sampling from DMs can be seen alternatively as solving corresponding stochastic differential equations (SDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this work, we formulate the sampling process as an extended reverse-time SDE (ER SDE), unifying prior explorations into ODEs and SDEs. Leveraging the semi-linear structure of ER SDE solutions, we offer exact solutions and arbitrarily high-order approximate solutions for VP SDE and VE SDE, respectively. Based on the solution space of the ER SDE, we yield mathematical insights elucidating the superior performance of ODE solvers over SDE solvers in terms of fast sampling. Additionally, we unveil that VP SDE solvers stand on par with their VE SDE counterparts. Finally, we devise fast and training-free samplers, ER-SDE-Solvers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all stochastic samplers. Experimental results demonstrate achieving 3.45 FID in 20 function evaluations and 2.24 FID in 50 function evaluations on the ImageNet $64\times64$ dataset.

### Summary
To speed the sampling in diffusion models, this paper proposes an extended reverse-time SDE (ER SDE). Contrary to the usual order of treatment, they unify prior explorations into ODEs and SDEs, wherein avoiding the lower diversity caused by neural ODEs. Moreover, some mathematical insights is presented to elucidate the fast reason of ODE solvers compared to SDE solvers. Importantly, the experiments show remarkably performance on all stochastic samplers.

### Strengths
The proposed method is novel and interesting to speed the sampling in diffusion models, which also avoid the lower diversity caused by ODE solvers. In my humble opinion, the mathematical analysis is rigorous and can support the improvements on the experiment results. Furthermore, the SOTA performance on stochastic samplers contributes to diffusion models to practice applications.

### Weaknesses
1.Though it is know that the diversity of generated images will be increased while using SDE solvers, it is better to use some metrics to demonstrate it, such as Inception Score and Precision. I guess it will further demonstrate the superior of ER SDE in community.

2.The $\phi (x)$ is a hyper-parameter, can it be adaptive implement on various diffusion models? since it is just set it manually in this paper.

### Summary
This paper formulates the sampling process as extended reverse-time SDE (ER SDE) for both VP and VE SDE, unifying previous diffusion ODEs and SDEs. Based on ER SDE and its semi-linear structure, the authors derive an analytical solution of ER SDE and then devise training-free SDE samplers. The authors then test their proposed methods on several image-generation experiments.

### Strengths
1. The paper is overall well-written and easy to follow.
2. This paper tested several hand-crafted noise schedules $\phi(x)$ and the numerical experiments show improvements compared to other baseline solvers.

### Weaknesses
1. The idea of extended reverse-time SDE with noise schedules uncorrelated with $g(t)$ has appeared in several papers, e.g. [1][2]. I think it would be beneficial to discuss them to motivate this paper better.
2. Proposition 3 and Proposition 5 in this paper claim it achieves arbitrary order approximations for SDEs, which is incorrect. The main fault is while deriving approximation error for SDEs, Ito-Taylor expansion rather than Taylor expansion should be employed. The authors may refer to [2][3] for more details.
3. The idea of utilizing the semi-linear structure in reverse diffusion process and analytical solutions has been well-established for ODEs, e.g. [4], and for SDEs, e.g. [2][3][5], which may lower the novelty of this paper.
4. The authors tested on different hand-crafted noise schedules $\phi(x)$. It would be better for authors to do some comprehensive experiments and design theory-motivated noise schedule principles.

### Summary
This paper proposes Extended Reverse-time SDE (ER-SDE) to model the sampling process of diffusion models, which can unify ODE-based and SDE-based sampling. Based on the approximation of the exact solution of ER-SDE, the authors propose ER-SDE-solver, a fast stochastic sampler for diffusion models. The experimental results on various datasets show that ER-SDE-solver achieves great sample quality within 20-50 NFE.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is clear and complete. 
2. RE-SDE-solver consistently outperforms other stochastic samplers within 50 NFE on different models and various datasets. 
3. Extensive ablation studies are provided to understand the design component of ER-SDE-solver.

### Weaknesses
1. The discretization error discussed in Section 4.1 needs further clarification. If I'm not mistaken, the discretization error is defined to be the remainder of the k-th order Taylor approximation. I do not see how the remainder is related to FEI and how you can control FEI to reduce the error. 
2. ER-SDE-solver needs to tune the hyperparameter for N-point numerical integration and design the noise scale function by monitoring the FID metric, which could be tricky to find the right balance for different models in practice. 
3. Section 4.2 discusses the results of ER SDE 4, ER SDE 5, and ODE. However, it is difficult to see the difference from Figure 3 (b). 
4. What is the order of the algorithm used to report Figure 3? The basic detail about the experiments in Figure 3 is missing in Section 4.2.
5. The claim of outperforming all other stochastic samplers is not well supported. For example, EDM sampler [1] can achieve FID 1.55 on ImageNet64 but the best FID reported in this paper is 2.24. 
6. Typo: in the last second paragraph of introduction, "... theoretically establish that the VP SDE solves yield image quality .. " -> "theoretically establish that the VP SDE solvers yield image ..."

### Questions
1. Regarding Table 2, can ER-SDE-solver further improve sample quality by increasing NFE? For example, in Figure 4(c) of EDM paper [1], EDM-solver can achieve FID 1.55 with more NFE.

### Summary
This paper introduces a generalized SDE framework called extended reverse-time SDE (ER-SDE) and the solver (ER-SDE-Solver) involved with this generalized SDE formulation. And this paper provides the formulation of the sampling process using the ER-SDE, providing the exact (integral) solution and approximate (linear, or higher-order) solution in both VP/VE cases, which can be generalized to all widely used SDEs. And this paper provides insights on the reasons on why ODE solvers show superior performance in terms of fast sampling. Finally, they validate the image generation performance with ImageNet64 dataset and CIFAR-10 datasets.

### Strengths
* Even though existing works generalized the SDE and its equivalent ODE (i.e., yielding the same solution of the Fokker-Planck equation), this paper dealt with the ratio with "how the solver should work as an SDE solver or ODE solver" with dynamically varying rate with respect to time (=sigma, SNR). And by some designing of this new time-dependent variable, this paper showed that some of the new SDE design choices (such as ER-SDE-5) shows superior performance compared to existing methods.
* The writing is concrete, and the additional experiments in the appendix resolved some of my questions (large-scale image datasets, or some ER-SDE ablations.)

### Weaknesses
* The design of phi(x) is one of the keys of this paper that distinguishes this to other existing works, but this is not interpreted enough.
* The necessity of the FEI coefficient is vague. Making the FEI coefficient as small as possible is equivalent to directly removing all noise, i.e., h(t)=0. And the trivial question arises; Why not just directly use the ODE solver and the Taylor-approximation-based higher-order sampler?

### Questions
* I am not fully understanding the motivation part; why does the low FEI coefficient lead to high sampling performance in low-NFE regime?
* The Figure 3 shows that the FID score is always the best when we use the ODE solver. Then, what is the advantage of the stochastic solver compared to the deterministic solver? And to the best of our knowledge, the FID score is lower (=better) with the stochastic sampler in the high-NFE regime. Even though the dynamically varying phi(x) looks sound, there is not enough evidence of the design of phi(x). Specifially, it will be better if there is some reasoning with the superior performance of ER-SDE-5, compared to other designs.

* What is the phi(x) of ER-SDEs used for experiments in ER-SDE-Solvers of ImageNet64?
* Could you compare your method to other sampling methods, such as PNDM and DEIS?
* What does the 'step' in Figure 3 stand for, in both FEI coefficients and FID scores cases? It seems that the steps stand for the sampling step within the whole 200 steps of the reverse process, and the number of function evaluations (NFE) for FID scores.

* In my opinion, some of the large-scale results in the appendix better explain the benefits of using this ER-SDE-Solver than small-scale results. I recommend aligning some of these results to the main material.
