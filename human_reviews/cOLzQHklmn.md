# Independently-prepared Query-efficient Model Selection

- Decision: Withdrawn (Treated as Reject)
- Scores: 5, 8, 3

## Abstract
The advancement of deep learning technologies is bringing new models by the day, which not only facilitates the importance of model selection but also makes it more challenging than ever. However, existing solutions for model selection either require a large amount of model operations proportional to the number of candidates when selecting models for each task, or require group preparations that jointly optimize the embedding vectors of many candidate models. As a result, the scalability of existing solutions is limited with the increasing amounts of candidates. In this work, we present a new paradigm for model selection, namely independently-prepared query-efficient model selection. The advantage of our paradigm is twofold: first, it is query-efficient, meaning that it requires only a constant amount of model operations every time it selects models for a new task; second, it is independently-prepared, meaning that any information about a candidate model that is necessary for the selection can be prepared independently requiring no interaction with others. Consequently, the new paradigm offers by definition many desirable properties for applications: updatability, decentralizability, flexibility, and certain preservation of both candidate privacy and query privacy. With the benefits uncovered, we present Standardized Embedder as a proof-of-concept solution to support the practicality of the proposed paradigm. We empirically evaluate this solution by selecting models for multiple downstream tasks, from a pool of 100 pre-trained models that cover different model architectures and various training recipes, highlighting the potential of the proposed paradigm.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of model selection, i.e., selecting one or few models from a large pre-trained model pool for downstrem task fine-tuning with best performance. The paper advocates for a new model selection paradigm with two merits: query-efficient and independently-prepared. This paper also proposes a model selection method named Standardized Embedder under this paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
- The proposed model selection paradigm (independently-prepared & query-efficient) is good.
- The proposed Standardized Embedder is effective. The idea of standardization is interesting.
- The related works are clearly introduced.

### Weaknesses
- The description of the proposed method is hard to understand. I read section 4 for multiple times and tried to figure out the implementation details of Standardized Embedder, but I still have some questions. 
  - I don't understand "any subset of the baseline feature set B can be directly associated with a binary vector $\{0,1\}^N$". Definition 2 is thereby unclear to me.
  - I think there may be a typo related to $\delta$-equivalence. In **Definition 1**, $\delta$-equivalence means the expected similarity between transformed features is larger than $1-\delta$, therefore if the $\delta$ is small, then the similarity is high (near to one). However, in the last line in page 6, "the optimization wants to find a subset of the baseline features that is $\delta$-equivalent to $F$ for larger $\delta$". I think the "larger $\delta$" should be corrected as smaller $\delta$. 
  - Although I understand the idea of standardization (using baseline features to derive the features of models and tasks), there are still other details of this method, and why are them designed in this way? For example, 
    - Why is $v$ constrained in $[0,1]^n$?
    - Why is the equivalence defined using affine transformations? For example, why don't we use $w^TF(x)$ only?
- The design of Standardized Embedder lacks enough justification. For example,
  - Are there any theoretical justification for the standardization? Although it's intuitive, the theoretical analysis is necessary to explain the effectiveness.
  - The comparison between Standardized Embedder and other existing model selection methods are missing. 
  - The study on task distribution generalization is missing. It's unclear if the selection works for task distributional shifts in downstream tasks. For example, as the current datasets are all about classification - what about the selection performance on other tasks like segmentation or object detection?
- There are some weaknesses about the experimental settings.
  - The "underlying distribution D" is approximated using ImageNet, which has class overlap with CIFAR (downstream task dataset).
  - The models are trained with a linear classifier and fixed feature. This is usually different with downstream fine-tuning. The results may thereby not be applicable to real applications as full model fine-tuning usually results in better results.

### Questions
- How to define "feature" for different models? As a neural networks usually contain many layers and different layer outputs may be used to construct the mapping $F: \mathcal X\to \R^n$, it is unclear how to choose it for different models. I guess in this paper, the final layer outputs before classification head are treated as feature. But what about the models like GPT-2 or BART that have many potential "features" definition (special token embeddings, avg/max-pooling of token embeddings, decoder/encoder representations)?

- In Definition 1, is $\delta\in [0,2]$?

### Summary
With the increasing number of open-sourced models in the community, model selection becomes more and more important. However, the scalability of existing solutions is limited with the increasing amounts of candidates. This work presents a new paradigm for model selection, namely independently-prepared query-efficient model selection. The advantage of their paradigm is twofold: first, it is query-efficient, meaning that it requires only a constant amount of model operations every time it selects models for a new task; second, it is independently-prepared, meaning that any information about a candidate model that is necessary for the selection can be prepared independently requiring no interaction with others. Consequently, the new paradigm offers many desirable properties for applications: updatability, decentralizability, flexibility, and certain preservation of both candidate privacy and query privacy. With the benefits uncovered, they present Standardized Embedder as a proof-of-concept solution to support the practicality of the proposed paradigm. Empirical results across different model architectures and various training recipes highlight the potential of the proposed paradigm.

### Strengths
- Model selection is an interesting, timely and important topic with the increasing number of open-sourced models in platforms such as HuggingFace.
- The proposed paradigm is novel and technically sound with various desirable properties, such as updatability, decentralizability, flexibility, and certain preservation of both candidate privacy and query privacy.
- The proposed method effectively selects a suitable model from a pool of 100 models and achieves good performance on downstream tasks.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- The existing work [1] seems to evaluate the pool of 1000s models. The scale of the number of models could be further increased.

### Summary
The authors' research belongs to a classical problem in the field of AutoML - automatic model selection. The two existing paradigms for model selection are Preparation-free and Query-efficient, but the existing paradigms do not have good scalability and efficiency in the face of the current massive requirements and models. So the authors propose a new paradigm named Independently-prepared Query-efficient, which makes the model recommendation process more accurate and efficient by computing embedded vectors for each model to be selected independently.

### Strengths
1. The authors present a very interesting perspective and way of thinking, starting from the paradigm of model selection, where each model to be selected is represented by an embedded vector and is computed and updated independently. In this way, the efficiency and accuracy of model recommendation can be improved, and the authors argued the decentralizability and flexibility of the new paradigm.
2.  The authors give a theoretical proof for the newly proposed STANDARDIZED EMBEDDER, which justifies from a theoretical point of view the deflation of the tensor representation of the depth space.
3. The authors conducted a series of experiments on a commonly used dataset for image categorization, and the experimental results demonstrated the realization of SOTA in terms of accuracy.

### Weaknesses
1.  I think the author has a problem with the title of the paper and the writing of the whole paper. The author says that he has proposed a new paradigm, but he has only made a little modification in the computation and mapping of embedded vectors, which does not match the innovation of the "new paradigm", and it is more suitable to use the "new method" for the discussion.
2. The theoretical proof is not sufficient to strongly support the author's point of view, while for the author's so-called new paradigm I suggest to describe it in relation to a specific application scenario.
3. The author's experiments I think are scanty and should be supplemented. Since it is a new paradigm, it should be suitable for all types of tasks and not just limited to deep models for object classification, or it should not be limited to the CV domain, but cover other such as NLP text classification, tabular classification, time-series classification and so on.
4. With the authors' experimental setup, I see that the claimed 100 pre-trained models are different hyper-parameter settings for several commonly used models, such as the number of network layers and so on. This is a different selection of models than what I understand, and I think the authors' experiments are more appropriately classified as either neural architecture search or hyperparameter optimization. Simply by modifying the hyperparameters should not be referred to as a different model.

### Questions
1. Can the new paradigm be applied to other areas like NLP, time series analysis, etc.? And provide the corresponding experimental results.
2. The time consumption is not shown in the experimental results, please show the time consumption of each step and compare it with baselines, especially the time for model selection.
