## Abstract
$K$-means clustering is a widely used machine learning method for identifying patterns in large datasets. Recently, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been proposed for solving the $K$-means optimization problem, which enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees. However, the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. In contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm widely used by machine learning practitioners, but it lacks a solid statistical underpinning and theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we consider an NMF-like algorithm that solves a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP-relaxed $K$-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP. In our experiments, we observe that our algorithm achieves significantly smaller mis-clustering errors compared to the existing state-of-the-art while maintaining scalability.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes an NMF-like algorithm for the problem of k-means clustering. The benefit of an NMF algorithm is its simplicity and scalability, but at the same time achieve the same statistical optimality as proven for the SDP. 
This is a clean, strong, and interesting contribution.

### Strengths
The problem is of course classical in machine learning and very important. 
The authors propose a simple and strong algorithm for this problem, and prove statistical guarantees. 
The paper is well-written and the proof seem clean to me.

### Weaknesses
No evident weakness except the separation assumption, but I acknowledge that overcoming this assumption is difficult mathematically, and even with this assumption the derivations and ideas are not trivial.

### Questions
I do not have important questions, but I wonder whether one can prove similar results for other distributions in (14)? I guess things will work out for sub-Gaussian distributions, but can you say something about the assumptions that are needed in your analysis in this sense?

### Summary
The paper presents an iterative method to (approximately) solve the k-means clustering problem. This method is obtained by applying existing methods ("Burer–Monteiro factorization approach") to a particular reformulation of (a relaxed version) of k-means. 
The authors claim that the resulting algorithm blends favorable computational and statistical guarantees of different existing methods for solving k-means.

### Strengths
Computationally efficient methods for solving k-means clustering, which is a core task of data analysis, are welcome.

### Weaknesses
* It is unclear how Theorem 1 allows to verify the claims about computational and statistical superiority of Algorithm 1 compared to existing clustering methods. In particular, how does Theorem 1 and the numerical experiments imply the claims "..simple and scalable as state-of-the- art NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality.." in the abstract?

* there should be more discussion or comparison of computational complexity and clustering error incurred by Algorithm 1 compared to existing clustering methods for the Gaussian mixture model Eq. (14). 

* the connection between theoretical analysis in Section 4 and the num. exp. in Section 5 could be made more explicit. For example, there are not many references to the theoretical results in the current Section 5. How do the numerical results confirm Theorem 1? How did the theoretical analysis guide the design choices (datasets, hyperparams of Algorithm 1) of the numerical experiments. 

* the use of Algorithm 1 needs more discussion: How to choose beta, alpha and r in practice? How does Algorithm 1 deliver a cluster assignment that approximately solves k-means?

* use of language can be improved, e.g.,
--  "..is the sharp threshold defined.." what is a "sharp" threshold ?; 
-- "..can be converted to the an equality-constrained.."
-- what is a "manifold-like" subset ? 
-- what is a "is a nonconvex approach" ? 
-- "...by simultaneously leverage the implicit psd structure" 
-- ".. that achieves the statistical optimality " 
-- "..which reparameterizes the assignment matrix .. as the psd membership matrix.."
--  what is a ".. one-shot encoding "?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new approach to solving the K-means clustering problem, addressing the limitations of existing methods. The authors propose an efficient nonnegative matrix factorization-like algorithm, incorporating semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations within an augmented Lagrangian framework. The algorithm optimizes a nonnegative factor matrix using primal-dual gradient descent ascent, ensuring rapid convergence and precise solutions to the challenging primal update problem. The method demonstrates strong statistical optimality guarantees comparable to SDP while being scalable and simple, similar to state-of-the-art NMF algorithms. Experimental results confirm significantly reduced mis-clustering errors compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in large-scale K-means clustering.

### Strengths
(1) $\textbf{New algorithm design}$: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for solving the K-means clustering problem, leveraging a combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) techniques and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. The proposed algorithm addresses the challenges faced by prior methods and offers a unique solution approach by integrating concepts from different areas of machine learning.

(2) $\textbf{Theoretical grounding and guarantees}$: The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for their algorithm, demonstrating local linear convergence within a primal-dual neighborhood of the SDP solution. The paper also offers rigorous proofs, such as the ability to solve the primal update problem at a rapid linear rate to machine precision. These theoretical insights establish the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method.

(3) $\textbf{Empirical validation}$: The paper supports its claims with empirical evidence, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of mis-clustering errors when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. This empirical validation strengthens the credibility of the proposed approach and highlights its practical utility in real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
$\textbf{Insufficient discussion of practical limitations}$: The paper might not thoroughly address the practical limitations or challenges that users might face when applying the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. Understanding the algorithm's limitations in terms of computational resources, scalability, or specific data types is crucial for potential users and researchers.

$\textbf{Initialization condition}$: The authors base their proof of Theorem 1 on the assumption that the initialization meets a specific condition. While this assumption is discussed in the paper, it would significantly enhance the rigor and credibility of their work if the authors were to provide a rigorous proof for this initialization criterion.

### Questions
1. Given the theoretical grounding and experimental results presented in the paper, how does the proposed algorithm compare to other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets? 

2. It is a little abstract to understand Propositions 1 & 2. The authors should improve their presentation here.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new algorithm for $k$-means problem in the Gaussian mixture model setting. The new algorithm overcomes some of the key limitations of prior algorithms for the same problem. Concretely, the SDP-based algorithm is not practical in settings where the datasets are large, and the NMF-based algorithm, despite its scalability, does not have theoretical guarantees. The new algorithm is inspired by these two methods and it is designed a way that it enjoys desirable properties of both the SDP and NMF-based methods. The authors show convergence guarantees in the exact recovery regime as well as the general setting for the algorithm and provide extensive numerical experiments that compare the new algorithm with prior approaches and demonstrate its performance.

### Strengths
**Originality**

The clever use of projected gradient descent to solve the primal of augmented Lagrangian efficiently shows the originality of the algorithm. I also appreciate the way authors cast the relaxed SDP formulation as a non-convex optimization problem so that a method like Burer-Monteiro can be used to find the low-rank solution. Derivations of the problem and the proof techniques are non-trivial.

**Quality**

Solid theoretical results on problem formulation and the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments are on point and demonstrate the theoretical guarantees.

**Significance**

$k$-means problem in GMM setting is an important problem for the community. A scalable solution for this problem that enjoys good theoretical guarantees is significant.

**Clarity**

The paper is easy to follow. The contributions are clearly stated and the content is well organized.

### Weaknesses
**Weaknesses**

The time complexity of solving the primal-dual algorithm is $O(K^6nr)$ and this becomes prohibitively large when $K$  is large. The experiments show small $K$ values(eg: $4$). Even for $K=10$, the time for convergence can grow very quickly. In some applications such as document deduplication, and entity resolution, the value of $K$ can be significantly larger than what is used in the experiments.  

**Typos**

1. On page 3, in the paragraph after equation $2$, "one-shot encoding" $\rightarrow$ "one-hot encoding".

### Questions
1. What is the criterion to select the rank $r$ in the algorithm? Is it arbitrary or is there are heuristic for this?

2. In experiments, I am noticing that the misclustering error of SDP is higher than this algorithm in general. Is it supposed to be like this? My understanding was SDP should have comparable or better accuracy than BM.  

3. Can the authors compare the dependency of time complexity on $K$  for this algorithm and prior methods? Perhaps it is not clear for the NMF-based method but for the other methods discussed in the paper, it maybe possible. It is helpful to understand in what regimes this algorithm can be applied instead of others. I believe the dependency of Lloyd's initialized with $k$-means++ on $K$ is not as severe as this algorithm.

4. Nowadays it is normal to see datasets with high dimensions. Numerical experiments in the paper use rather small values for dimension $p$(eg: $20$). Are there experiments done with higher dimensions, perhaps in the range $p=100, 500, 1000$? This will be helpful to determine how this algorithm performs in high dimensions compared to others.
