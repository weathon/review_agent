## Abstract
Causal representation learning has showed a variety of settings in which we can disentangle latent variables with identifiability guarantees (up to some reasonable equivalence class). Common to all of these approaches is the assumption that (1) the latent variables are represented as $d$-dimensional vectors, and (2) that the observations are the output of some injective generative function of these latent variables. While these assumptions appear benign, we show that when the observations are of multiple objects, the generative function is no longer injective and disentanglement fails in practice. We can address this failure by combining recent developments in object-centric learning and causal representation learning. By modifying the Slot Attention architecture (Locatello et al., 2020), we develop an object-centric architecture that leverages weak supervision from sparse perturbations to disentangle each object's properties. This approach is more data-efficient in the sense that it requires significantly fewer perturbations than a comparable approach that encodes to a Euclidean space and we show that this approach successfully disentangles the properties of a set of objects in a series of simple image-based disentanglement experiments.

### Summary
This work addresses the issue of non-identifiability in causal representation learning models using object-centric approaches. The authors show that using sparse transitions between pairs of images and models that exploit such regularities can allow to solve the responsibility problem when attempting to invert a data-generation process in the image domain. Specifically, the exploit the fact that object centric models partition images into objects to reduce the number of interventions needed in order to identify the properties that correspond to each object thus allowing them to be identified. To encourage identifiability the authors introduce a penalty that seeks to keep all slots in the object-centric representation constant for both images, which can them only vary for the object that was perturbed. The authors then show that this leads to an increase in the ability of downstream models to predict the different properties of the objects in a scene.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well motivated based on the limitations of previous work in causal representations learning and object-centric approaches.
2. The authors correctly justify their approach with easy to follow but formal statements (or propositions) that theoretically ground their approach.
3. While maybe a bit light on experiments, I believe that for their particular purposes the results substantiate their results, with one caveat that I will address later.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors do however miss the opportunity to connect their research with previous work on disentanglement learning in a more systematic way. Indeed their approach of encouraging sparse transitions has already been explored in disentangled models (albeit not object-centric ones) in Klindt et al., (2021) and Montero et al., (2022). and thus these are both relevant work that should be discussed (though I don't think a comparison with these methods is required).
2. While I don't have an issue with the evaluation per se, I do think that the scores of the models should be separated by properties as well as averaged over all of them (as is currently presented according to my understanding).

### Questions
My only question is related to how good the prediction of each individual object property is. My understanding is that the prediction scores are averaged over all properties, but previous research has show that some properties are easier to predict than others (eg. rotation is harder than position). Thus, I would like to see the scores for these different properties in isolation.

### Summary
The paper studies causal representation learning in the context of multi-object scenes, challenging the assumptions commonly held in previous work on single-object images (such as injectivity). The paper proposes a new approach for disentangling object properties via weak supervision under sparse perturbations and assesses its effectiveness on synthetic datasets.

### Strengths
-	The study effectively bridges recent advances in causal representation learning with object-centric learning, both from theoretical and methodological perspectives. The theoretical analysis identifies and discusses the issue of non-identifiability (e.g., non-injectivity) in multi-object scenarios. The method part nicely adapts the weakly-supervised approach from disentangled/causal representations to multi-object contexts.
-	The paper is very well written and enjoyable to read.

### Weaknesses
- Insight: While technical sound, the proposed method itself appears not as interesting. If I understand correctly, the method is essentially nothing but adding a slot matching step to the existing weak-supervised disentangled representation learning.
- Positioning: The claim of being the first to `achieve disentangled representations in environments with multiple interchangeable objects` is overstated. Similar objectives have been pursued in recent studies, e.g., Block-Slot Representation [1]. Slot matching has also been considered in recent work [2]. A more thorough positioning in the literature about multi-object scenes might be needed.
- Theory: the proof sketch for Proposition 2 appears less than compelling in its current form. Part of my doubt is attributed to the use of identical objects. It would strengthen the paper if the author could prove Proposition 2 in more common scenarios.

------------------------------------------------   

Post-rebuttal Review:

The response from the authors has addressed the primary concerns I had previously. I thus raise the rating from 5 to 6. \
The theoretical part is definitely a solid contribution, whereas the insight and positioning of the current manuscript remain somewhat weak. \
I would recommend the authors to consider incorporating their rebuttal into the final version of their paper.

### Questions
- It's stated in Sec4 that the object-centric model requires k times fewer perturbations. Is there any empirical evidence to support this claim?
- For slot matching, is it necessary to solve an expensive optimization problem (Eq13)? How does it perform compared to a simple initialization trick (e.g, using the slot of the 1st image to initialize that of the 2nd)?
- Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation on `simply add a projection head, that is trained by a latent space loss`? Why is the projection head needed on top of the object-centric encoder?

### Summary
The authors focus their attention on disentanglement in an object centric environment. Authors formally introduce the challenges that may arise when multiple objects are present in the observations, especially when objects can be identical. Authors also show the effect experimentally by plotting the achieved MCC score. Authors combine the ideas of object wise partition and Ahuja et al.'s weak supervision disentanglement to solve the aforementioned problem with a claim that fewer perturbations are needed in such procedure due to shared latent spaces in the objects. Experiments are conducted with a single set of latent variables shared across multiple objects in the scene, with 2D and 3D synthetic dataset. Authors deal with both discrete and continuous latents. Experiments are conducted against a strong baseline.

### Strengths
- Clear communication of proposition and idea
- Well thought through related work sections and explanations
- Always felt I understood what authors are trying to say
- Simple yet elegant idea to solve the multiple object disentanglement problem
- Strong baseline for experimentation

### Weaknesses
- I feel the experimental setup was quite limiting for the proposed claim
- How do we handle multiple set of latents? What happens when there are shared and not-shared latents across this set how does the disentanglement look like?
- Authors mentions limitations on number of objects and background although I would like to see the effect on some real life dataset (maybe can be constructed with multiple colored mnist images in the scene?)
