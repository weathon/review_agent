## Abstract
Molecular conformation generation, a critical aspect of computational chemistry, involves producing the three-dimensional conformer geometry for a given molecule. Generating molecular conformation via diffusion requires learning to reverse a noising process. Diffusion on inter-atomic distances instead of conformation preserves SE(3)-equivalence and shows superior performance compared to alternative techniques, whereas related generative modelings are predominantly based upon heuristical assumptions. In response to this, we propose a novel molecular conformation generation approach driven by the observation that the disintegration of a molecule can be viewed as casting increasing force fields to its composing atoms, such that the distribution of the change of inter-atomic distance shifts from Gaussian to Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The corresponding generative modeling ensures a feasible inter-atomic distance geometry and exhibits time reversibility. Experimental results on molecular datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed shifting distribution compared to the state-of-the-art.

### Summary
**Summary**: The authors propose performing diffusion on interatomic distances where the true distances are modeled as a gaussian with small variance and the base distribution is a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution with very high variance. They claim this method, SDDiff, preserves SE(3)-equivariance and achieves state-of-the-art results on two molecular conformation benchmarks.

### Strengths
**Pros**: 

- Diffusion map between gaussian and MB distribution has not been done to the best of my understanding.

- The mathematical derivations in the main text seems sound. I did not check the appendix. Theoretical results are supported with simulations.

### Weaknesses
**Cons**:

- *Mischaracterization of prior works*. I do not understand the benefit of diffusion on interatomic distances. The authors claim GeoDiff assumes distances follows a gaussian distribution. Having read GeoDiff, I do not see this assumption. GeoDiff applies diffusion directly on atomic positions. More so, GeoDiff achieves SE(3) equivariance.

- *Missing baseline*. Torsional diffusion has been out for more than a year and achieves state-of-the-art results on the baselines considered in this work. There is no mention of this paper in the related works and it is missing from the baselines. This is a major red flag.

- *Weird theoretical assumption*. The shifting score from gaussian to MB relies on a huge std (\sigma=50) until the perturbation kernel matches MB. First, this seems computationally awkward to have to go distances greater than 400 (figure 2). It seems the huge sigma is avoided with the commonly used scaling trick to control the scale of the score matching objective. However, why is it necessary to go this far and force the base distribution to be MB? Why can't we have a normal diffusion between two gaussians? \sigma=1 looks similar to gaussian to me.

- *Unconvincing results*. The authors claim a new state-of-the-art results. However, they leave out a important baseline and the improvements are extremely small in Table 1. The benefits of SDDiff compared to GeoDiff are within noise. The improvement is at most 0.08 on metrics... Furthermore more difficult benchmarks have been released since [2] almost a year ago. Evaluating against GeoDiff when GeoDiff already achieves 95% seems like the wrong problem to be focusing on.

- *Unexplained analysis*. Section 4.5 is confusing to me. The first part regarding the marginal vs. joint seems to be saying the dependence between distances can be thrown out. This is done without explanation other than a hypothesis and throwing this out makes diffusion on distances no different than diffusion on particles to me. Even in the introduction, diffusion on distances is motivated through the dependence on interatomic forces so throwing them out seems to go against the original motivation. Furthermore, the approximation to OT is very brief and I did not understand the point here.

While I think diffusion on distances rather than particles is interesting for ML on molecules, the formulation in this work confuses me of why it is beneficial (if at all). The results are not convincing and prior works are either mischaracterized or left out. Due these issues, I recomend reject.

### Questions
- Why are there negative distances for the gaussian pdf in figure 2?

- The SDDiff authors claim their method is useful in achieving SE(3) equivariance but why is this novel if GeoDiff and related works can already do so?

- How is p_t sampled? This and the training procedure are not specified. What is the \sigma schedule?

### Rating
5: marginally below the acceptance threshold

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method for molecular conformation generation. The main contribution of the paper is that instead of the Gaussian diffusion process, the paper proposed to use transition kernels changing from Gaussians to Maxwell-Boltzmann. This is in correspondence with adding Gaussian noises to molecular structures. The paper shows good mathematical justification for the closed-form score kernel. Experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of common benchmarks.

### Strengths
Originality is good but not surprising. The model follows the existing geometric diffusion models but with novel transition kernels, and the paper well explains the mathematical foundation of the diffusion process.

Quality and clarity are good. The paper is well-presented and easy to follow. The technical details are clearly explained.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness from my perspective is the significance of empirical comparison. The improvement over GeoDiff is not significant to me. Could the author provide more ablation study about the $f_\sigma$ function in Eq7, which can help to verify the importance of the proposed MB diffusion distribution.

### Questions
I may miss some details, but feel a little confused about defining the diffusion process on the distances. The motivation is "Gaussian on coordinates results in MB distribution on distances". Then, why not add noise on coordinates which can also enable the MB diffusion on distances? I feel the direct perturbation in distances will also potentially result in infeasible geometry?

### Summary
The authors present a diffusion model for generating molecular conformations achieving slightly better scores than SOTA. The authors ensure SE(3)-equivariance by using atom-atom distance matrices from which they construct the conformations. The model (SDDiff) uses a novel shifting score loss, that shifts the distribution of interatomic distances between Gaussian and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The proper physical motivation for this remains unclear.

### Strengths
The empirical performance is compelling

### Weaknesses
-	Probably my biggest problem with the paper is the motivation for using the Maxwell- Boltzmann distribution (MBD). The MBD describes the distribution of the length of velocity vectors in an ideal gas, and to some good approximation even in a real molecule. The authors generate molecular conformations based on distances, velocities are never generated nor used (e.g., the math on page 5 after eq 7 only includes distances). It is also unclear how interatomic distances (which are by definition purely positive) or the length of velocities could ever follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the appearance and meaning of velocity v in eq 5 needs to be explained clearly.
-	Regarding Section 4.5, if a molecule were to break apart, there will be some correlation of atom-atom distances, i.e., if an atom's distance to another one which is far away in the graph increases this will almost certainly also mean that the distance of the neighboring atom to the far away atom increases. This is more correlation than causation, but it does contain information. Additionally, instead hypothesizing can the authors at least show empirically that their statement is true?
-	Regarding the measures COV and MAT. If we assume that a molecule has, e.g., 3 major conformers which are all very close in RMSD. Wouldn’t a model that samples always only one conformer achieve a COV of 1, even though it has never generated the other 2? Also, the definition of MAT seems odd, is there sum over S_r and maybe a min() missing?
-	On page 9: The authors write that it is evident that the proposed distribution matches the Gaussian closely, however, in Fog. 4 the orange distribution appears to be tri-modal Can the authors compute the overlap of orange and blue for the two values of sigma?
- 	In Section 4.2, even though D is defined as image(d), R^(n×3)/SE(3) is not isomorphic to D: a molecule and its mirror image would have the same distance matrices, but they are not the same element of R^(n×3)/SE(3) if they are chiral. In this regard, it would be valuable for the authors to clarify how the proposed method handles the generation of conformers for stereoisomers or enantiomers.
-In Section 5.1, the COV and MAT metrics introduced correspond to the “Recall” version (COV-R and MAT-R, without the typo mentioned below). Some of the baseline methods under comparison, such as GeoDiff (Xu et al., 2022) and Torsional Diffusion (Jing et al., 2022), also include the “Precision” version (COV-P and MAT-P) to assess the quality of the generated conformers. The authors should include the “Precision” metrics in Table 1 as well.

### Questions
-	Especially in the introduction several papers are missing the year of publication, e.g., Xu et al., Jing et al, Zhu et al.,  it is therefore not clear which paper is being cited and if multiple occurrences denote the same paper.
-	What do the authors mean by marginal distribution of interatomic distances? If the full set of 3N(3N-1)/2 number of distances are included, this distribution would be even higher dimensional than the 3N-dimensional Boltzmann distribution of Cartesian coordinates. 
-	It is not clear how equation 7 follows from 6 nor how it justifies to “simply” use a Gaussian kernel.
-	On the bottom of page 5, where the authors state that n has to be greater-equal to 5. It would be good to mention there that “Each individual atom must be associated with a minimum of four distances, in order to establish isomorphisms between …”
-	The implications of the “Note…” after eq 9b remain unclear.
-	The paragraph on optimal transport, says that the authors use the regularized Wasserstein barycenter but then continue saying that it is not suited. So what exactly do the authors do?
-	The caption of Table 1 is too short. The caption should at least explain the meaning of COV and MAT and refer the reader to their definition in the text.

-	Why exactly is planarity a problem? Don’t 4 neighbors define any point in 3d exactly?

	In Section 5.1, The MAT(-R) metric should be corrected as follows:
MAT=1/|S_r |  ∑_(C∈S_r)▒min┬(C^'∈S_g )⁡RMSD(C,C^' ) .

### Rating
3: reject, not good enough

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors point out an interesting connection between the gaussian perturbation kernel and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and propose a diffusion model to learn such shifting score kernels for conformer generation. They perform a standard benchmark and show that their proposed methods have superior performance under the standard metric.

### Strengths
The connection between gaussian perturbation and inter-atomic distance shifts are quite interesting, and the authors are able to leverage such observation to learn a diffusion model to learn such shifting scores. It gives an interesting likelihood model on top of many diffusion-based conformer generation models.

### Weaknesses
While the observation is interesting and it's great that the authors are able to demonstrate its superior performance, the GEOM benchmark has been used for quite some time now and probably over-optimized, so it's difficult to argue true superiority marginal gain on one benchmark alone. In addition, the majority of the mathematical framework for score matching involving langevin dynamics are not new to this problem either.

### Questions
I am happy to re-evaluate my rating if the authors can provide more compelling evidence that the proposed methods are not just another conformer generation model. For instance, showing superior downstream application impact would be very helpful.
