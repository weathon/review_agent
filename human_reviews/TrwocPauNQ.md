## Abstract
In this paper, we study offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) where we aim to learn the human's underlying reward and the MDP's optimal policy from a set of trajectories induced by human choices.   RLHF is challenging for multiple reasons: large state space but limited human feedback, the bounded rationality of human decisions, and the off-policy distribution shift. In this paper, we focus on the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) model for modeling and understanding human choices. DCC, rooted in econometrics and decision theory, is widely used to model a human decision-making process with forward-looking and bounded rationality.  We propose a \underline{D}ynamic-\underline{C}hoice-\underline{P}essimistic-\underline{P}olicy-\underline{O}ptimization (DCPPO) method. \ The method involves a three-stage process: The first step is to estimate the human behavior policy and the state-action value function via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); the second step recovers the human reward function via  minimizing Bellman mean squared error using the learned value functions; the third step is to plug in the learned reward and invoke pessimistic value iteration for finding a near-optimal policy. With only single-policy coverage (i.e., optimal policy) of the dataset, we prove that the  suboptimality of DCPPO \textit{almost} matches the classical pessimistic offline RL algorithm in terms of suboptimality’s dependency on distribution shift and dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first theoretical guarantees for off-policy offline RLHF with dynamic discrete choice model.

### Summary
This paper studies Reinforcement Learning under Human Feedback (RLHF) setting where human feedback is not myopic. They model this as an offline MDP setting and tackle the three main challenges unique to RLHF (which is similar to offline RL): (1) The agent must infer human behavior policies from the offline data. (ii) The agent must tackle a dynamic environment and estimate a reward function from behavior policies. (iii) Finally tackle the challenge of insufficient dataset coverage and large state space. To do this they propose a dynamic choice pessimistic policy optimization algorithm. This is a value iteration-based algorithm that incorporates a penalty term (pessimism) that ensures learning in an offline setting (standard for offline RL setting). Thy study three settings and establish sub-optimality bounds for them. These are the settings for the general model class, linear model class and RKHS model class and all of them suffer from an additional $e^H$ term. This is a theory RL paper and they do not conduct any experiments.

### Strengths
1) Understanding the RLHF setting and its connection to offline RL is an important direction of research.
2) They introduce a standard algorithm with the penalty term (pessimism) to tackle the three challenges of RLHF.
3) They theoretically analyze three settings and establish sub-optimality bounds for them.

### Weaknesses
1) Some assumptions need more justification.
2) The learning of the human preference model is not clear.
3) Discussions on some factors in the sub-optimality gaps are missing.
4) The connection to offline learning is clear but the difference and key technical novelty needs to be discussed more.
5) No discussions on lower bound.

### Questions
1) One of my main concerns is understanding the Assumption 3.2 (and subsequent similar assumption) on model identification. Is this $a_0$ similar to a safe action as in conservative/constraint bandits (or MDP)? Why is this required and where doe this show up?
2) Another concern is the missing discussion on technical novelty. This paper does not discuss where does their proof differs from Jin et al (say) for the linear MDP setting. Can you elaborate on this? Similar papers on theoretical RL has extensive discussion on their main proof. (see Uehara orr Jin et al.)
3) Another concern is the extra factor of $e^H$ in the bound. Where and how do they show up? Is it really necessary or is it possible to get rid of them?
4) A detailed discussion on the main difference between RLHF an offline MDP settings is missing. Your proofs seem to leverage many of their techniques. Can you elaborate on the main similarities/differences of the proof technique briefly? This will help me put te paper in context.
5) Finally please discuss your idea on the lower bound (at least for the linear MDP setting which is well understood). This will help us understand if the $e^H$ factor is really necessary.

### Summary
The main objective of this paper is to investigate the realm of offline Reinforcement Learning in scenarios where the reward is not directly observable. To address this challenge, the authors introduce the DCPPO algorithm. To elaborate, the authors start by making assumptions about the agent's policy based on certain characteristics and then proceed to recover the concealed reward function through human feedback. Once the reward is estimated, the DCPPO algorithm incorporates it into a standard RL framework to discover a policy that is close to optimal. Ultimately, the authors provide a theoretical guarantee regarding the sub-optimality of the resulting policy.

### Strengths
1. In contrast to conventional RL algorithms, this study does not depend on an observable reward function. Rather, it endeavors to recover the concealed reward through human feedback.

2. The paper is skillfully composed and presents information in a comprehensible manner.

### Weaknesses
1. This study lacks novelty as the algorithm is essentially a straightforward integration of a reward learning framework with a standard reinforcement learning algorithm, offering little in terms of groundbreaking innovation.

2.The assumption regarding the agent's policy in equation (1) is overly restrictive. Specifically, it mandates that every agent has access to the value function $Q_h^{\pi}$, which may be unattainable if the agent lacks prior knowledge of the transition probability function $P_h$. If the transition probability function $P_h$ is already known, Algorithm 2 becomes redundant, and it suffices to focus solely on estimating the reward as in Algorithm 1.

3. The estimation error discussed in equation (9) may encounter issues stemming from data dependency. To elucidate, the estimated reward is constructed in Algorithm 1 and relies on the offline dataset. However, in Algorithm 2 (Line 2), the agent performs ridge regression using the same dataset. Due to this data dependency, it is possible that $E[\tilde V (s_{h+1})]\ne P_h \tilde V (s_h,a_h)$. A similar issue has been addressed in the work by Jin et al. (2019) through the application of uniform convergence techniques. Unfortunately, in this study, the estimation reward function lacks a linear structure, and the corresponding value function class may not have a small covering number. Consequently, even with the use of uniform convergence techniques, the problem may not be resolved.

### Summary
This paper handles the case of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) where the underlying reward function is not available and the optimal policy needs to be estimated from human state-action trajectories. This is a setting similar to Inverse RL where the reward function is learned from human demonstrations to train the agent via RL loop. The paper uses Dynamic-Choice-Pessimistic-Policy-Optimization to find the optimal policy under the special case of a dynamically evolving MDP, for example, the RLHF case where the reward is obtained at each intermediate step of token generation as opposed to the final token.

### Strengths
The paper looks at a special case of optimal policy learning under dynamic choice where the underlying MDP seems to be changing after each choice made which is not considered in the usual RLHF literature. The paper proposes an unique algorithms Dynamic-Choice-Pessimistic-Policy-Optimization (DCPPO) to handle this situation.

### Weaknesses
**Dynamic choice setting**: The paper claims that it handles the special cases of (a) unobserved rewards that should be learned from the human trajectory, and (b) dynamic choice where the underlying MDP is dynamically evolving. For the first case, the settings seem similar to generalized Max entropy Inverse RL works (which is addressed in the next point). Secondly, the paper gives an example of the dynamic rewards for RLHF, where rewards are obtained at intermediate steps as well. However, I am not sure why this is referred to as `dynamic nature of MDP transition` because this is similar to MDP settings, assuming state $s_t = x_{1:t}$ based on which the probability of the next token will be affected. This can be handled with standard offline algorithms, and therefore I am not clear on the motivation behind DCPPO.

**Similarity to Max Ent Inverse RL**: As mentioned above, this work seems similar to Max Ent Inverse RL works. The paper mentioned in the appendix that this work is a generalization of such previous works, however, I am still not convinced that MaxEnt IRL method would not be applicable to the mentioned setting because of the above reason. Additionally, there has been some work to generalize MaxEnt IRL works [1, 2]. Given this, I am not sure why Dynamic Discrete Choice might be necessary for RLHF settings and if they are practical.

**Empirical results**: The paper does not provide any empirical analysis of DCPPO compared to other online/offline algorithms. Even a simple comparison would have clarified the importance of DCPPO in such settings and would also help with the above issues.

### Questions
Questions to the author:
- Could you clarify the setting under which DCPPO would be necessary and practically useful and why existing IRL methods cannot handle such settings?
- In the paper, is there a special consideration for language model training because the term RLHF seems to indicate that? If not, is this work addressing a special setting for inverse RL/imitation learning?
