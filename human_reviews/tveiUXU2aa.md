# SWAP-NAS: Sample-Wise Activation Patterns for Ultra-fast NAS

- Decision: Accept (spotlight)
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
Training-free metrics (a.k.a. zero-cost proxies) are widely used to avoid resource-intensive neural network training, especially in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Recent studies show that existing training-free metrics have several limitations, such as limited correlation and poor generalisation across different search spaces and tasks. Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT. When integrated with an evolutionary algorithm for NAS, our SWAP-NAS achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in approximately 6 minutes and 9 minutes of GPU time respectively.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduced a novel training-free network evaluation metric based on Sample-Wise Activation Patterns. The proposed SWAP-Score and regularised SWAP-Score show stronger correlations with ground-truth performance than 15 existing training-free metrics on different spaces, stack-based and cell-based, for different tasks. The regularised SWAP-Score can enable model size
control during search and can further improve correlation in cell-based search spaces. It is integrated with an evolutionary search algorithm as SWAP-NAS.

### Strengths
The training-free NAS method shows better performance than previous SOTA and 5 NAS benchmarks. The searching time is reasonably low. The proposed metric looks very promising for model expressivity.

### Weaknesses
The method assumes ReLU as the activation function, which is a big limitation as more and more transformer based networks use GELU.

### Questions
Can this method apply to transformer-based NAS?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel training-free metric called SWAP-Score, based on Sample-Wise Activation Patterns, for zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The SWAP-Score measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples and outperforms 15 existing training-free metrics on various search spaces and tasks. The authors also introduce regularisation to the SWAP-Score for model size control during the search

### Strengths
- Robust Experimental Results: Upon meticulously examining and executing the code provided in the supplementary files, I affirmed the robustness of the experimental results by myself. The effectiveness of the proposed SWAP-NAS has been convincingly validated through my independent verification.

- Comprehensive Experimental Validation: The authors have conducted extensive experiments across multiple NAS-Bench datasets, demonstrating the clear superiority of SWAP-NAS. This broad-spectrum analysis significantly strengthens the validity and generalizability of the proposed approach.

- Clarity and Accessibility of Presentation: The paper is exceptionally well-crafted, featuring lucid and coherent exposition. The methodology is articulated in a manner that is not only easy to comprehend but also straightforward to follow. This enhances the paper's accessibility to a broader audience within the field.

### Weaknesses
- Limited Applicability to ReLU-based Networks: One limitation of this approach is its dependency on neural networks using ReLU activations. While ReLU is widely used, it represents a subset of possible activation functions, which narrows the scope of application and might not encompass the full diversity of network architectures.

- Similarity to NWOT Format: It's worth noting that the format of the proposed zero-cost proxy shares similarities with existing methods like NWOT. While not necessarily a weakness, this overlap should be acknowledged and explored further to understand the distinctions and innovations brought by SWAP-NAS.

- Unclear Impact of Dimension: The influence of dimensionality remains somewhat obscure in the paper. It's important to consider that neural networks, especially in shallow layers, may exhibit varying feature map sizes. A more detailed analysis of how these differences affect SWAP-NAS would enhance the completeness of the study.

- Absence of Correlation Visualization: The paper lacks visualizations that illustrate the correlation between SWAP and performance, which could provide valuable insights into the method's behavior and its implications for optimization. The inclusion of such visual aids would strengthen the paper's argument and help readers grasp the methodology's practical significance.

### Questions
1. How are `sigma` and `mu` related to model parameters, and what mechanisms allow their automatic configuration in SWAP-NAS?

2. In Figure 4, what causes TranBench101 to exhibit inferior performance compared to NAS-Bench-x01? Are there specific factors that contribute to this observed difference?

3. The paper claims versatility of SWAP-NAS across various tasks, including object detection, autoencoding, and the jigsaw puzzle. However, the primary focus seems to be on image classification results, such as ImageNet and CIFAR. Can the authors shed light on the reason for this specific focus? Furthermore, are there any plans or intentions to investigate SWAP's performance in the other mentioned domains in future work?

### Summary
This paper proposes a training-free metric called SWAP-score, which measures the expressivity of the networks. This metric can be integrated with the evolutionary NAS method to obtain competitive performance on several datasets with the least search cost.

### Strengths
1. The proposed metric is efficient and has a good correlation with the ground truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, beating all existing training-free metrics in public benchmarks. 
2. The metric combined with the evolutionary search method can achieve good performance with extremely small search costs.

### Weaknesses
1. Missing references:

Please cite and compare with them in Table 1 and Table 2.
2. The method is proposed to be used in the ReLU activation function-based network, which is not been proven to work well on other nonlinear activation function-based networks or not.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach called SWAP-NAS for ultra-fast Neural Architecture Search (NAS) based on Sample-Wise Activation Patterns. SWAP-NAS outperforms existing metrics on various search spaces and tasks, achieving competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in just a few minutes of GPU time. The paper also discusses the limitations of existing training-free metrics in NAS and how regularisation can enhance the SWAP-Score and enable model size control during the search.

### Strengths
Strengths:
- The proposed SWAP-Score and regularised SWAP-Score show much stronger correlations with ground-truth performance than existing training-free metrics on different spaces and tasks.
- The regularised SWAP-Score can enable model size control during search and can further improve correlation in cell-based search spaces.
- When integrated with an evolutionary search algorithm as SWAP-NAS, a combination of ultra-fast architecture search and highly competitive performance can be achieved on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, outperforming SoTA NAS methods.

### Weaknesses
- The paper only give numerical numbers on NAS Search Space, and did not show or analyze any searched neural architectures, to back the claim that Sample-Wise Activation Patterns would measure the network’s expressivity more accurately.

### Questions
- How would SWAP-NAS integrate with pruning-based search method such as the one used in TE-NAS?
- How to intergate regularised SWAP-NAS with FLOPs or Latency budget constrain?
