# Private Zeroth-Order Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization

- Decision: Accept (poster)
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
We introduce a new zeroth-order algorithm for private stochastic optimization on nonconvex and nonsmooth objectives.
Given a dataset of size $M$, our algorithm ensures $(\alpha,\alpha\rho^2/2)$-Renyi differential privacy and finds a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point so long as $M=\tilde\Omega(\frac{d}{\delta\epsilon^3} + \frac{d^{3/2}}{\rho\delta\epsilon^2})$.
This matches the optimal complexity found in its non-private zeroth-order analog. 
Notably, although the objective is not smooth, we have privacy ``for free'' when $\rho \ge \sqrt{d}\epsilon$.

### Summary
The paper proposes a differentially-private zero-order algorithm for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, and analyzes its convergence rate.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written overall.
The contribution fits naturally into the line of recent developments in nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, introducing the first private algorithm for this setting (as far as I know).
The techniques, though well rooted in previous works, are nontrivial to compose and are executed nicely.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness in my opinion is that most proof components (as far as I can tell, all but the trick of decomposing the gradient into a sum of differences and applying a grad-difference estimator) appear in previous works, adequately cited throughout the paper.

### Questions
Questions:
- Preliminaries, Definition of $\|\nabla h(x)\|_\delta$: Regarding the "equivalent" definition - why is this equivalent? This is not clear to me, unless repetitions in S are allowed. Can the authors please explain this? Only a bound in one direction is immediate, as far as I can tell (which suffices for the main result of the paper). Also, the inequality in the definition is probably meant to be an equality (though only the inequality is clear to me, as I previously mentioned).
- Lemma 2.2: I do not see why the "immediate corollary" is immediate. Can the authors please explain?

Minor comments:
- Section 1.1, 2nd paragraph typos: 1) "Out gradient oracle..."=Our; 2) Citing Dwork et al., Chan et al.: \citep is more suitale than \citet.
- Section 1.1, 3rd paragraph arrives too early in my opinion. The authors discuss technicalities which are completely unclear at this point of the paper.
- Preliminaries, Definition of $\|\nabla h(x)\|_\delta$: The infimum is of the norm over the set, currently miswritten as the set itself.
- Differential privacy preliminaries: The authors should define Renyi divergence, and ref the two stated facts - "then it is also...", and "ensures that \Acal is ...-RDP" (specifically cite the result, not the whole manuscript).
- More generally, regarding the differential privacy preliminaries paragraph: it is not clearly explained how differential privacy relates to the stochastic optimization model, this is important and should be revised. e.g., "two datasets Z,Z'\in\Zcal", what is \Zcal? It should be explained that this is the same z in the stochastic objective etc.
- Equation in online learning (standard OSD regret bound) - add citation.
- Lemma 2.2: Actually h does not need to be differentiable (it is automatically differentiable almost everywhere anyhow by Rademacher's theorem, which suffices for everything).
- Section 2.1, 1st paragraph: "... a low sensitivity gradient oracle from ...", maybe should emphasize that this is a *stochastic* gradient oracle.
- Section 3, paragraph second to last: "as Lin et al. has proved..." - As Lin et al. write before the proof of Lemma D.1, the lemma is actually taken from the paper "An optimal algorithm for bandit and zero-order convex optimization with two-point feedback" by Shamir [2017, Lemma 10], only restated by them. Hence this is a more appropriate reference.
- Paragraph before Remark 4.1 includes a forward reference to Remark 4.1, maybe the remark should appear earlier? (I do not see a reason not to.)
- Remark 4.2: I appreciate the authors adding an informal explanation about the Node function, though I found it hard to follow and I suggest revising it.
- Proof after Corollary 4.4 - this is a proof of Theorem 4.3, right? Should clarify this.

### Summary
The paper studies differentially private zeroth-order algorithms for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization and proposes the first algorithm under this topic. The convergence analysis of the algorithm shows that the non-private term matches with the optimal rate in non-private zeroth-order nonsmooth nonconvex optimization. The private term is $d/\delta$ times worse than the best-known rate for private first-order algorithms for smooth nonconvex optimization.

### Strengths
The paper studies a new topic that aims to obtain private zeroth-order algorithms for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, while most existing works for private nonconvex optimization focus on first-order algorithms for smooth objective functions. The proposed method creatively combines existing results and leads to a non-trivial convergence analysis. The presentation of the paper is well-structured and clearly introduces different components of this new algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. The reason to study differentially private (DP) zeroth-order methods for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization is not well motivated in this paper. I agree it is important to study DP nonconvex optimization, and there is indeed a rich literature that focuses on first-order methods. The paper mentions some applications of zeroth-order methods where gradients can be hard to obtain, including reinforcement learning. However, there is no notion of the dataset in these applications, then it is not immediate to incorporate DP. The paper should find some settings where DP zeroth-order algorithms are necessary. The current introduction looks like a simple combination of different concepts.

2. The computation complexity is never reported and compared with existing DP first-order methods and non-DP zeroth-order methods. I guess it will be $d$ times worse since $d$ samples are required to construct the zeroth-order estimators, which could be bad when $d$ is large. I understand the need for $d$ samples to reduce the variance of DIFF, but why is it also used for GRAD? Also, the paper uses a two-point estimator for GRAD and a one-point estimator for each gradient in DIFF. Is there any specific reason for this difference in the choice?

3. Is the assumption that $f(x,z)$ is differentiable required? I think Lipschitzness is enough in most nonsmooth nonconvex optimization literature, which implies the function is almost everywhere differentiable. Moreover, the main convergence results rely on the assumption that the domain of $\mathcal{A}$ is bounded by $\delta/T$. Projection is thus required to make sure this assumption is satisfied. However, as $\delta/T$ is typically very small, such projection suggests that each update of $x$ only increases the magnitude of $x$ by at most $\delta/T$ and every iterate remains in a ball with radius $\delta$ centered at $x_1$ after $T$ updates. What if there is no stationary point in this ball? Does the convergence result still make sense? I guess it is then required that $\delta$ should be sufficiently large, and the $(\delta, \epsilon)$-stationarity would be weak.

4. I find it hard to parse Remark 4.2 and Theorem 4.3. What is the definition of $n_j$, $\mathcal{X}^i$ and $\mathcal{S}^{(i)}$? What is the need for the first index in the tuple of NODE? It is only required to sum the second index in NODE as per line 3 of Algorithm 5. I am also confused by the statement in Remark 4.2 that says NODE stores the largest node in each layer. NODE(7) and NODE(8) both have 3 layers, but one has 3 elements while the other only has 1 element.

5. Minor: The standard results in $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP say something like $\Vert \nabla F\Vert^2 \leq \sqrt{d\log(1/\delta)}/(n\epsilon)$. Here, the dataset with size $n$ is given, and the best achievable rate given $n$ is studied. It might be good to also report such a rate following the standard since private data is not as many as one can collect and is assumed to be given in advance; The proposed method is a single-pass algorithm, but in machine learning practice, training tends to be in multiple epochs; In Section 2, $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP is used when introducing differential privacy. It might be good to change it to avoid confusion with $(\delta, \epsilon)$-stationarity.

### Summary
This work introduces a zeroth-order stochastic optimization algorithm for nonconvex and nonsmooth objectives. This algorithm finds a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point with $(\alpha, \alpha \rho^2/2)$-Renyi differential privacy within $O(d {\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}} + d^{3/2} \delta^{-1} {\rho^{-1} \epsilon^{-2}})$ data complexity. 

This algorithm uses non-private Online-to-non-convex Conversion (O2NC) framework proposed in previous work that finds a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point using a first-order oracle. On top of this framework, this paper builds an approximate first-order oracle with a zeroth-order oracle. Specifically, this first-order oracle samples $d$ iid estimators for each data point to achieve optimal dependence on $d$.

### Strengths
1. This work investigates the important problem of nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization, which is a frequent setting in modern machine learning. It provides an efficient algorithm that finds a stationary point while attaining differential privacy. The sample complexity required matches its non-private analog. 
2. The paper is technically solid, clearly presented, and well-structured, with the key proof step contained in the main text, so that it is easy for the readers to follow the key proof ideas.

### Weaknesses
1. As discussed in the paper, the need to sample $d$ iid estimators for each data point seems to be less natural. 
2. It would be good to have some discussions on how differential privacy is attained in other similar (e.g., 1st order) optimization problems.

### Questions
1. It is claimed in Section 1.1 that "the non-private term $O(d {\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}})$ matches the optimal rate found in its non-private counterpart." Is this sample complexity proved to be the lower bound for zeroth-order optimization on non-smooth non-convex objectives?
2. The algorithm samples $d$ iid estimators for each data point. Do you think it is essentially necessary to achieve the current dependence on $d$, or is it limited to the analysis technique?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of zeroth-order nonsmooth nonconvex optimization with differential privacy and provides an algorithm with sample complexity $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\delta\epsilon^3} + \frac{d^{3/2}}{\rho\delta\epsilon^2})$, where the optimal sample complexity for the non-private version is $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\delta\epsilon^3})$. The authors obtain this result by constructing a variance-reduced oracle with the tree mechanism.

### Strengths
The paper is technically solid. The private setting is both important and interesting. This was done without sacrificing a good complexity; the sample complexity is optimal in some regimes $\rho > \sqrt{d} \epsilon$. In general, I think this is a nice paper with a clear idea and with good explanations that show the motivation for each statement or its proof. I really like the authors explained why the naive approach would give the sub-optimal rate in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
1. The result heavily based on the previous paper on the non-private version (Cutkosky et al., 2023.) makes it seem a bit incremental. 
2. Understandably, there is no space in the current ICLR format for experimental evaluation, this is something that could be looked at in the future.
