## Abstract
Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) aims to leverage more computational resources to train autonomous agents with less training time. Despite recent progress in the field, reproducibility issues have not been sufficiently explored. This paper first shows that the typical actor-learner framework can have reproducibility issues even if hyperparameters are controlled. We then introduce Cleanba, a new open-source platform for distributed DRL that proposes a highly reproducible architecture. Cleanba implements highly optimized distributed variants of PPO and IMPALA. Our Atari experiments show that these variants can obtain equivalent or higher scores than strong IMPALA baselines in moolib and torchbeast and PPO baseline in CleanRL. However, Cleanba variants present 1) shorter training time and 2) more reproducible learning curves in different hardware settings.

### Summary
The authors present, Cleanba, a new platform for distributed DRL that addresses reproducibility issues under different hardware settings. One of the biggest challenges in applying deep reinforcement learning to real world problems is reproducibility. In general, the algorithms are not robust to implementation details which are often crucial for successful real-world applications. The authors introduce a new distributed architecture that is reproducible if random seeds are controlled and leverages interleaving the actor and learner’s computations. The main contribution of the paper is that the authors propose a new mechanism to synchronize the actor and learner which reduces the non-determinism and improves reproducibility. While the synchronization mechanism is simple, the experiments show that Cleanba’s variants can obtain equivalent or higher scores than moolib’s IMPALA, but with 1) less training wall time under the 8 GPU setting and 2) more reproducible learning curves in different hardware settings.

### Strengths
Originality & Significance. The proposed synchronization mechanism is simple yet results in significant improvement in training time and reproducibility. Both reduced training time and reproducibility are among the key challenges in applying deep reinforcement learning to real works problems. Therefore despite the simplicity of the proposed mechanism, I believe that the performance improvement is significant. 

Quality & Clarity. The authors describe the current state-of-the-art and its pitfalls clearly using clear code samples. They provide empirical results to further their hypothesis on what contribute to the current reproducibility issues in popular distributed reinforcement learning architectures. The experiments are extensive in comparing the proposed architecture to other benchmarks in the literature.

### Weaknesses
Originality & Significance. The authors propose to mechanisms to overcome the reproducibility issues in distributed reinforcement learning: 1) de-coupling hyper-parameters, 2) a new synchronization mechanism to better align actors and learners. The de-coupling mechanism is not novel and already exists in prior literature. The synchronization mechanism is simple yet novel. The performance of the new approach is tested only in Atari which is not a real-world problem where reproducibility is a key challenge. The paper can greatly benefit from a real-world application.


Quality & Clarity. The language is a bit off in several sections, specifically in the first paragraph, which makes it difficult to read at times. There are several grammatical errors as well.

### Questions
At first, I was really confused about the novelty and contribution of the paper. In the abstract and introduction, the paper talks about variants of already existing algorithms but does not talk about the novelty of the proposed variant specifically until past mid-way though the paper. It will be better to talk about the contributions first even when they may be simple yet have far reaching implications to reduce training time and improve reproducibility at scale.

It is important to consider a real-world example when reproducibility is one of the main challenges. Atari is a great way to benchmark but does not present all the variability such as in robotics applications for example to truly highlight issues related to the reproducibility.

In Section 5.1, the authors state that Cleanba’s IMPALA is 6.8x faster than monobeast’s IMPALA, mostly because Cleanba actors
run on GPUs, whereas monobeast’s actors run on CPUs. I think the performance metrics should be based on the same compute hardware CPU only or GPU only.

### Summary
This paper presents cleanba, a jax based software framework for reproducible distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL). The authors present errors that arise from existing non-deterministic DDRL frameworks that could harm reproducibility efforts, then propose a deterministic solution (which comes at the cost of stale data). The authors show the stability and reproducibility of cleanba, and evaluate it on a suite of standard Atari benchmarks.

### Strengths
- Reproducibility is a notorious issue in all of machine learning, but RL especially, and it is good to see more work addressing it
- The paper is generally clear and understandable
- Figure/text colouring is generally pretty useful

### Weaknesses
- The abstract’s first sentences feel a bit choppy
- There are other Sebulba implementations that might be worth comparing to (e.g. https://github.com/instadeepai/sebulba) 
- Fig 2 could motivate the problem better, given that in the current figure both versions end up at very similar scores. If there was a different environment just highlighting that this 1 second lag has a meaningful detriment to final performance that could be really compelling.
- Although IMPALA is a common algorithm, devoting a short paragraph to it in the background could be helpful (since although many are familiar with it, not as many are with the intricacies as it relates to distributed computing that get mentioned in the next section)
- In Figure 5, the y axis could have their tickers removed. The absolute numeric scales are not particularly meaningful (I suspect even the most experienced RL researcher will not know if a score of 200,000 on UpNDown is good) and add a lot of clutter to the figure
- The majority of Fig 1 is highlighted. Maybe it’s better to just highlight the part that is the same? Or remove the highlighting? It just doesn’t add much when the points you want to draw attention to are basically the whole code block.
- In figure 3, the optimality gap x tickers are overlapping
- Moolib is a good point of comparison, but I see that this repo is now archived. Are there other DDRL libraries worth comparing to that are more actively maintained?
- One concern I have is that this paper tries too hard to be an algorithm paper. It presents cleanba, which is a software package that the authors want people to use, but not a lot of time is dedicated to that. More time is dedicated to the analysis of results from cleanba. While these results are somewhat interesting, I think they could be consolidated more (e.g. move the individual atari games to the appendix, and just present HNS, just an idea). Then use that space to actually describe the package of cleanba more (e.g. how does a user interact with it? Extend it? UML diagram perhaps? Etc.). The paper is called “cleanba” for the package, but I can’t say I really know programmatically much about cleanba after reading the paper.

### Questions
- I can’t evaluate the code, since there is no anonymized access to it, but I feel given that this introduces a package, that code quality is relevant. Is the code documented well and complete with type hints and docstrings and the like?
- How easy is it to extend the framework? What plans are there for other algorithms? What do the development goals look like from here?

### Summary
This paper introduces Cleanba, a new reproducible distributed RL training platform. It verifies the reproducibility on PPO and IMPALA in different hardware settings.

### Strengths
It implements a new reproducible and fast distributed RL training platform.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper does not touch the real problems that cause the reproducibility issues. It not only occurs in distributed RL training but also occurs in the single machine training even using the same hyperparameters. Reverb and [1] have reported that replay ratio (the number of gradient updates per environment transition) greatly affects the performance. [1] Revisiting Fundamentals of Experience Replay
2) The Cleanba shown in Figure 1 does not match the “learner always learns from the rollout data obtained from the second latest policy” (line 7).
3) “ensuring the learner performs gradient updates with rollout data of second latest policy” assumption is too strong. It may slow down the IMPALA training.
4) It would be beneficial to provide more reproducibility results in relation to different RL algorithms such as Ape-X, SeedRL, etc.

### Questions
Please address the above weaknesses.

### Summary
The authors introduce CleanBa, a distributed RL library containing distributed implementations of IMPALA and PPO. They demonstrate that IMPALA's actor-learner architecture causes issues with reproducibility 
because the learner can do a different number of updates depending on its speed. 

To solve this, they then propose a new architecture, where the policy updates based on the rollouts of the second latest policy. This ensures reproducibility at the cost of more synchronisation and the introduction of stale data.

They demonstrate that their framework performs well compared to relevant baselines and runs much more quickly.

### Strengths
* The paper is well written and clearly explained.
* The reproducibility problems identified in IMPALA are interesting and well addressed by their new framework.
* The empirical results demonstrate the framework is faster than prior methods on comparable hardware.

### Weaknesses
* The authors claim to have built a distributed learning framework, but have only evaluated their method on a single machine. This is a major flaw in their evaluations, and the reason I recommend rejection for this paper. If this is included I will increase my score. 


Typos: 
At the end of section 4.2 you write `jax.distibuted` -- I think this should be `jax.distributed` (extra r).

### Questions
* How does the extra param queue impact the distributed performance (i.e. speed)? i.e. how much cost is paid in speed for fixing the reproducibility issues?
