# Motif-aware Attribute Masking for Molecular Graph Pre-training

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors. However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn long-range dependencies from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture long-range inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.

### Summary
The paper introduces a masking strategy named MoAMa centered on chemical motifs. By breaking down each molecular graph into distinct motifs and masking node features within them, the method reconstructs those masked nodes. The paper also proposes an evaluation method considering inter-motif influence to help analyze the pre-training model on molecular dataset.

### Strengths
1. Pre-training for molecular representation learning is important.
2. Inter motif influence is a good aspect which needs to be further studied on pre-training.

### Weaknesses
1. My first question is that is inter-motif influence considered in the proposed method? In my understanding, inter-motif influence is only considered as an evaluation metric. Is it considered in the pre-training process?
2. If the inter-motif influence is an evaluation process, then the main contribution of the MoAMa is masking the whole motif instead of masking nodes. It comes up with an issue that completely masking the entire motif might be excessively difficult for the pre-trained GNN to reconstruct. Specifically, if all the nodes within a k-hop range of a motif are masked, then that particular node will never acquire any information about the features of its neighbors.
3. The complexity of calculating inter-motif influence needs to be discussed. For each graph, influence between any two nodes needs to be calculated by applying two modified graphs into a graph neural network, which means it needs to run the graph neural networks at most O(N^2) times. I highly recommend authors discuss the complexity of their proposed evaluation method.
4. How have the authors presented the test AUC? Is it the test AUC corresponding to the best validation AUC, or is it the final test AUC? It's essential to provide clarity on these experimental configurations to ensure the results can be reproduced.
5. The layout of the paper, especially section 4.3, is unclear. I found it challenging to link section 4.3 with its preceding section. Additionally, section 4.4 appears to have a closer relation to section 4.2, given its extended discussion on the pre-training strategy.

### Summary
Attribute reconstruction in graph neural network pre-training can be used to predict properties of molecules. Previous methods mask out randomly chosen nodes and rely too much on local neighbors, hindering the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this work, the authors introduce a motif-aware attribute masking strategy for graph model pre-training, outperforming random masking methods. It is explained that the proposed approach obtain the advantage by transferring long-range inter-motif knowledge and intra-motif structural information. Ablation studies were conducted to support the explanations.

### Strengths
The motif-aware attribute masking strategy graph model pre-training is new. 
The manuscript is well written and is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The proposed approach was applied to binary classification problems. It will be interesting to see its performance on regression problem (e.g., the QM9 dataset)

### Questions
Experiments show that the proposed approach does not always outperform existing methods. It will be nice if the authors can provide some insights.

### Summary
The paper proposes a motif-aware atom masking approach for pre-training on molecular data. The idea behind is that an atom embedding should not only be influences by the closest neighbor nodes, and the paper includes some more formal analysis about how the proposed masking may adapt node influence scores. The experiments compare to other works on the moleculenet benchmark and contain a series of ablation studies.

### Strengths
- I agree that masking is under-investigated in molecular SSL.
- The proposed approach is straightforward and makes sense to me, and the analysis in terms of node influence is nice.
- The ablation experiments offer some more insights, although some (e.g., studies on loss, MLP projection) seem to me rather side information not exactly supporting the main contribution.

### Weaknesses
- The related work is missing all references to masking approaches in SSL beyond graphs. ICLR is a more general DL conference and graph SSL has clearly been inspired by those, and there are various works on masking, including theory.
- Some strong assumptions of the proposed approach are not enough backed by references, in my opinion. And the experiment design largely makes use of them (the proposed MRR metrics, ablation studies). 
   * l. 100: "For molecular graphs, random attribute masking results in either over-reliance on intra-motif neighbors or breaking the inter-motif connections via random edge masking." - may need some more explanation and references that this really hurts the embedding
   * l. 35: "The presence and interactions between chemical motifs directly influence molecular properties, such as reactivity and solubility (Frechet, 1994; Plaza et al., 2014). Therefore, to capture the interaction information between motifs, it is important to transfer inter-motif structural knowledge and other long-range dependencies during the pre-training of graph neural networks. - while this says that interactions are important, it does not say that neighbor information is not important or, specifically, that it is less important
   * "Unfortunately, the random attribute masking strategies used in previous work for graph pre-training were not able to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in inter-motif knowledge (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Hu et al., 2020b; Pan et al., 2019). That is because they rely on neighboring node feature information for reconstruction (Hu et al., 2020a; Hou et al., 2022)." - Usually, GIN is applied with 5 layers and the studied molecules are rather small.

- Sec 5.3
   * l.271 "MoAMa outperforms all previous methods" - maybe "all we report here"
   * While I think that this type of inter-motif information is relevant, I think the experiments should focus on showing that it is complementary or improving upon regular masking. However, this is not visible from the experiments reported. Also, the paper could make more visible which models are directly comparable in terms of masking (e.g., since they use the same baseline architecture and pre-training data) and which not (e.g., the comparison to Grover is lacking since the baseline model is already very different). 
   * It seems, for a comparison of the masking approach itself, the focus has to be on the "w/o L_aux" model, howver, then the performance increases compared to the baselines are not as clearly showing that this inter-motif information is really the best one.

### Summary
This work proposes MoAMa to better enable the transfer of long-range inter-motif knowledge and intra-motif structural information by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Each molecule is decomposed into disjoint motifs, and the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. Experimental results also prove the effectiveness of MoAMa.

### Strengths
(1)This paper is well-structured, logically sound, and provides a thorough explanation of MoAMa, with clear and concise figures.
(2)Due to the importance of chemical motifs for molecular properties and chemical reactions, the paper attempts to capture long-range dependencies from higher-level substructures, and the paper's motivation is sound and beneficial.
(3)The paper defines five inter-motif influence measurements to measure the inter-motif knowledge transfer of graph pre-training, and evaluates the models using these indicators, which is novel and significant.

### Weaknesses
(1)The paper only conducted experiments on one downstream task (classification). The main experimental results might not be quite sufficient.
(2)This paper lacks visualization results, case studies, and other interpretability analyses.

### Questions
(1)According to MGSSL[1], BRICS alone tends to generate motifs with large numbers of atoms. When the motif segmentation is too fine, many generated motifs are single atoms or bonds, which inhibits GNNs from learning higher-level semantic information through motif generation tasks. I wonder if the authors considered this issue when using only BRICS for motif fragmentation.
(2)The experimental datasets used in this study are all classification datasets in molecular property prediction. Could the authors validate regression datasets such as ESOL and FreeSolv, to further assess the effectiveness and generalization ability of MoAMa?
(3)I have some confusion about the experimental results for the baselines. The experimental results for the baselines in this paper show a certain discrepancy from the reported AUROC in the original baseline papers. Could the authors please clarify the reasons behind this difference?

### Summary
The paper proposes a motif-based masking strategy for molecular representation pretraining. Unlike other studies that usually randomly mask node attributes, the paper proposes to mask the nodes in a motif manner, and then reconstruct them in the decoder. In such a way, the model will capture both intra-motif and inter-motif information. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced auxiliary loss is used to complement the reconstruction loss.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-motivated, since random masking is the trend now. It is good to see that the authors advocate including domain knowledge such as motifs.
+ The ablation study is quite comprehensive, as it evaluates each component thoroughly.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method does not seem solid enough. Many details lack theoretical support. For example, the criteria to restrain the masked motif selection is intuitive without much explanation. The authors claim that the proposed method is able to utilize graph structure, while it is unclear how the motif-aware masking addresses this issue. Another claimed contribution is to capture both local and long-range information, while it is not discussed how the motif masking captures long-range other than random masking. The masked motifs can still be close, and the message passing is still within the k-hop. 
- The L_aux is proposed to complement L_rec since attribute masking focuses on local graph structures. Then this loss seems to fit with all the attribute masking methods. The results in Table 1 show that, MoAMa w/o Laux does not show much superiority compared with other baselines. It seems that the proposed motif-aware masking might perform limited. The authors should try Laux on other attribute masking methods to see if there are improvements. Also, it is not well elaborated on why and how Eq. 14 is designed.
- The results do not seem promising, and as the last point states, the effectiveness of the proposed motif-aware masking is questionable. 
- The paper lacks an overall framework to help understand the detailed implementation. 
- The technical novelty of the paper is relatively incremental for an ICLR paper. The paper primarily focuses on a narrow aspect of the pretraining method, switching from random masking to motif-wise random masking, which may have limited impact on the community.
