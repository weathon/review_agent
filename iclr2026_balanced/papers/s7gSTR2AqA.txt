ABSTRACT


Converging evidence suggests that human systems of semantic categories achieve
near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB) complexityaccuracy tradeoff. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this
objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient
human-aligned semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on color
categorization—a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization with uniquely
rich human data—and replicate with LLMs two influential human studies. First,
we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that LLMs vary widely
in their complexity and English-alignment, with larger instruction-tuned models achieving better alignment and IB-efficiency. Second, to test whether these
LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a humanlike inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo
color-naming systems in LLMs via a method we refer to as Iterated in-Context
Language Learning (IICLL). We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency. However, only a
model with strongest in-context capabilities (Gemini 2.0) is able to recapitulate the
wide range of near-optimal IB-tradeoffs observed in humans, while other state-ofthe-art models converge to low-complexity solutions. These findings demonstrate
how human-aligned semantic categories can emerge in LLMs via the same fundamental principle that underlies semantic efficiency in humans.


1 INTRODUCTION


As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly popular in everyday use, it is crucial to
understand how their learning biases and representational capacities align with our own. Here, we
investigate this by focusing on a key aspect of human intelligence: the ability to organize information into semantic categories (Croft, 2002; Rosch, 2002; Koch, 2008; Boster, 2005; Majid, 2015;
Malt & Majid, 2013). This phenomenon presents two major challenges for AI. First, systems of
semantic categories (semantic systems, for short) exhibit both universal patterns and cross-language
differences (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Berlin, 1992; Croft, 2002), which LLMs must navigate. Second,
LLMs are not grounded in the rich physical and social environment that humans are (Rosch, 1975;
Labov, 1973), and it is unclear how these differences affect their ability to learn human-aligned semantic categories. Therefore, in order to understand whether LLMs can efficiently communicate
with people and adapt to changing environments and communicative needs in a human-like manner, it is crucial to study whether LLMs are capable of structuring meaning according to the same
principles that guide humans.


To address this open gap in our understanding of LLMs, we propose a novel theoretical and
cognitively-motivated framework for studying semantic systems in LLMs. We build on the framework of Zaslavsky et al. (2018), which argues that languages efficiently compress meanings into
words by optimizing the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle (Tishby et al., 1999), instantiated as
a tradeoff between the informational complexity and communicative accuracy of the lexicon. This
framework has broad empirical support across human languages (Zaslavsky et al., 2018; 2019; 2021;
Mollica et al., 2021; Zaslavsky et al., 2022). Furthermore, Imel et al. (2025) recently showed that a
drive for IB-efficiency may be present in the individual inductive biases of human learners. While
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of human language data encoded as text, they are not trained with

respect to the IB objective. This raises the question: are LLMs capable of developing IB-efficient
human-aligned semantic systems?


We address this open question with an in-depth analysis in the domain of color—a key test case
for categorization theories in cognitive science with rarely available human data as well as practical
implication for human-LLM interactions (see Section 2.1)—and replicate with LLMs two influential human behavioral experiments (Figure 1). First, we conduct an English color naming experiment (analogous to the human experiment of Lindsey & Brown, 2014), designed to assess the
efficiency and human-alignment of the color naming systems of LLMs. Second, we conduct an
iterated learning experiment of pseudo color-naming systems (analogous to the human experiment
of Xu et al., 2013), designed to reveal implicit inductive learning biases of LLMs by simulating a
process of cultural transmission (see Section 2.3). For the latter, we extend Zhu & Griffiths (2024)’s
iterated in-context learning (I-ICL) paradigm to iterated in-context _language_ learning (IICLL).


Our key findings and contributions are summarized as follows: First, we show that many prominent
LLMs struggle to capture the English color naming system, exhibiting a wide range of complexities
that are often lower than the complexity of English. However, with increased size and instructiontuning, LLMs can achieve high English-alignment and IB efficiency. Second, using our IICLL
paradigm, we show that LLMs that perform well in the naming task are not merely mimicking
patterns in their training data but are actually guided by a human-like inductive bias toward IBefficiency. Specifically, we show that LLMs iteratively restructure initially random artificial systems
towards greater IB-efficiency and increased human-alignment. However, among the models we
tested, only the model with strongest in-context capabilities (Gemini 2.0) is able to recapitulate the
wide range of near-optimal IB-tradeoffs observed in humans, while other models converge to lowcomplexity solutions. Finally, we show that Gemini can also develop structured category systems
via IICLL in a domain that is qualitatively different from color, suggesting that our result could
potentially apply also in other domains.


Taken together, our findings demonstrate how human-aligned semantic categories can emerge in
LLMs via the same fundamental principle that underlies semantic efficiency in humans. Importantly,
neither humans nor LLMs are explicitly trained for optimizing the IB objective, suggesting that IBefficiency, and optimal compression more generally, may emerge to support intelligent behavior.


2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION


2.1 TALKING ABOUT COLOR


For decades, cognitive scientists have used color as an essential tool to study perception and categorization. This is in part due to the unprecedented amount of human behavioral data available
for color, which includes research on perceptual space, cross-linguistic semantic variation, category learning, and cultural evolution. Especially relevant to our study is the World Color Survey
(WCS) dataset (Cook et al., 2005), which contains color-naming data from 110 non-industrialized
languages. Another relevant study by Xu et al. (2013) demonstrated that the cultural transmission of
initially random, artificial color-term systems in humans leads to more regular systems that resemble those documented in the WCS dataset. To our knowledge, these two data resources— on actual
cross-linguistic naming patterns and on the cultural evolution of category systems—are unique to
the domain of color, making it an ideal domain for evaluating how well LLMs align with human
behavior. Furthermore, studying color naming in LLMs also has practical implications. Generative
AI models, used for tasks like image generation and online product searches, require grounded representations of color language. In order for such models to interact in ways we expect them to, it
is crucial to determine the extent to which state-of-the-art LLMs have learned the meaning of color
terms that actually align with human naming patterns.


While previous work has shown that human-aligned color representations can be recovered from
LLMs (e.g., Abdou et al., 2021; Patel & Pavlick, 2022), there is limited research on model behavior
in the context of real-world settings (namely, prompt-based interactions). Marjieh et al. (2024)
showed that several recent instruction-tuned models (specifically, GPT-3, its “ChatGPT” variants,
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI et al., 2024) and Mistral 7B Instruct (Jiang et al.,
2023)) can recover the English and Russian color naming systems by prompting the models to label
hex codes. In contrast, we test a large set of 39 models with varying sizes and training stages, we

humans and LLMs. Multi-modal LLMs can observe colors either via text or images. ( **c** ) Illustration
of the IICLL paradigm. At each generation _t_, an LLM is prompted with a small dataset for ICL, _dt−_ 1,
consisting of pairs of colors and pseudo labels sampled from the previous generation’s language,
_Lt−_ 1. With these data in context, the LLM performs the naming task for the full space (a).


consider both textual inputs and image inputs (for multi-modal models), we analyze the LLMs’
color naming systems through the lens of the IB framework, and we further assess their underlying
inductive learning biases in a cultural evolution process via iterated learning. Next, we provide
relevant background on the IB and iterated learning frameworks below.


2.2 THE INFORMATION BOTTLENECK PRINCIPLE AND SEMANTIC SYSTEMS


The IB framework for semantic systems (Zaslavsky et al., 2018), which we employ in this work,
is based on the following communication model: a speaker wishes to communicate a mental representation, or belief state, _m_ _∈M_, defined as a probability distribution over world states _u_ _∈U_,
by mapping it to a word _w_ _∈W_ via a stochastic encoder _q_ ( _w|m_ ). A listener then receives _w_ and
interprets the speaker’s intended meaning by constructing an estimator _m_ ˆ _w_ . In the case of color, for
example, the world states _U_ are given by a set of target colors (Figure 1a). To account for perceptual
noise, it is assumed that each _m_ is a Gaussian distribution over the perceptual CIELAB color space
centered around a corresponding target color (Zaslavsky et al., 2018). That is, each color is mentally
represented by the speaker as a Gaussian distribution and the listener’s goal is to reconstruct the
speaker’s belief state over colors.


According to this framework, in order to communicate efficiently, the speaker and listener must
jointly optimize the IB tradeoff between minimizing the complexity of their lexicon and maximizing its accuracy. Assuming the listener’s inferences are adapted to the speaker, the lexicon is defined
by an encoder _q_ ( _w|m_ ). Complexity in IB roughly corresponds to the number of bits required for
communication, formally defined by _Iq_ ( _M_ ; _W_ ), the mutual information between speaker’s meanings and words. Accuracy is defined by _Iq_ ( _W_ ; _U_ ), the information that the speaker’s words maintain about the target world state, which is also inversely related to the KL-divergence between the
speaker’s mental state and the listener’s inferred state, E _q_ [ _D_ [ _M_ _∥M_ [ˆ] ]] (Harremoes & Tishby, 2007;
Zaslavsky, 2020). An optimal lexicon, or semantic system, is one that minimizes the IB objective
function
_Fβ_ [ _q_ ] = _Iq_ ( _M_ ; _W_ ) _−_ _βIq_ ( _W_ ; _U_ ) _,_ (1)
where _β_ _≥_ 0 controls the complexity-accuracy tradeoff. The solutions to this optimization problem
define the IB theoretical limit of efficiency.


This framework generates precise quantitative predictions that have been gaining converging empirical support across hundreds of languages and multiple semantic domains, ranging from perceptually

grounded domains such as color (Zaslavsky et al., 2018; 2022) to higher-level conceptual domains
such as household objects (Zaslavsky et al., 2019; Taliaferro et al., 2025) and personal pronouns (Zaslavsky et al., 2021). In addition, it has been successfully applied to studying emergent communication in artificial agents (Chaabouni et al., 2022; Tucker et al., 2022; Gualdoni et al., 2024; Tucker
et al., 2025).


**The IB color naming model.** As part of our evaluation of LLM color naming, we use the previously published IB color naming model from Zaslavsky et al. (2018). The black curve in Figure 3
shows the IB bound for color naming from this study, together with a reproduction of their results
showing that color naming systems across languages (from the WCS as well as English from Lindsey & Brown (2014)) achieve near-optimal IB tradeoffs.


2.3 ITERATED LANGUAGE LEARNING


The second main theoretical framework we apply in this work is based on iterated learning (IL). IL
is a paradigm in cognitive science for simulating cultural transmission and eliciting prior inductive
biases (Griffiths & Kalish, 2007; Kirby et al., 2008; Griffiths et al., 2008). In a typical IL experiment,
participants form chains of “generations.” At each generation _t_, a participant is exposed to data _dt−_ 1
from the previous generation and then produces responses that become input for the next generation. In iterated language learning (ILL), participants learn examples of pairs of stimuli and artificial
labels during a training period, after which they assign labels to new, unlabeled stimuli in the same
meaning space. In doing so, participants produce a full category system _Lt_, which is sampled from
to provide training examples to the next generation, and the process repeats. This process, which
requires generalization from limited data, reveals learners’ inductive biases for certain linguistic or
category structures (Griffiths & Kalish, 2007; Griffiths et al., 2008). As shown in Griffiths & Kalish
(2007), under certain conditions, namely that the IL agents are Bayesian who share priors and likelihood functions, this Markov chain converges to a stationary distribution over languages equal to the
learners’ prior distribution _p_ ( _L_ ). This makes the strong prediction that languages emerging from IL
reflect the population’s underlying inductive biases. Although this is an asymptotic characterization
of IL dynamics, in behavioral experiments with people, researchers observe rapid convergence to
highly non-uniform distributions of languages (Kirby et al., 2015).


**Related** **work** **on** **ILL.** Previous research in machine learning has investigated dynamics related
to ILL. In agent-based simulations, Ren et al. (2020) introduced the neural iterated learning (NIL)
framework, and showed how it can lead to compositional language in neural network agents, and
Carlsson et al. (2024) showed that introducing communication-based training in NIL leads to IBefficient color naming systems. These studies, however, did not explore LLMs as we do here. Zhu
& Griffiths (2024) adapted IL to LLMs with strong in-context learning capacities as a prompt-based
workflow known as Iterated In-Context Learning (I-ICL) to elicit LLMs’ implicit prior distributions over aspects of world knowledge. I-ICL has recently been used to analyze cultural evolution
in LLMs (Ren et al., 2024) and to compare visual and linguistic abstractions between LLMs and
humans (Kumar et al., 2024). Here, we introduce iterated in-context _language_ learning (IICLL,
Figure 1c), which goes beyond prior work in leveraging the strong in-context learning abilities of
LLMs to replicate as closely as possible the experimental conditions of ILL studies with humans,
enabling a direct comparison to LLMs of their respective inductive biases, particularly with regards
to semantic efficiency and alignment.


**ILL** **of** **color** **naming** **systems.** The empirical comparison for our IICLL color naming study is
the IL data from Xu et al. (2013). In their experiment, participants were asked to learn and transmit
novel systems of color terms across thirteen generations. We focus on their main results that include
twenty iterated learning chains, each initialized with a random partition of the WCS grid. These
chains vary in the number of allowed color terms, ranging from two to six, and four replications of
each condition. Participants were shown a set of randomly selected colors generated uniquely for
each chain, and paired with corresponding pseudo words. After training, participants were asked to
label all 330 colors of the WCS grid. Xu et al. (2013) found that over time, the IL chains become
increasingly regular and resemble the color naming systems documented in the WCS dataset. More
recently, Imel et al. (2025) found that these chains also converge to highly efficient systems along
the IB bound. Figure 3 shows our reproduction of this finding (plotting only final generations).

3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP


Our goal is to test whether LLMs have an inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, as observed in humans. To this end, we conduct two studies with LLMs: (1) an English color naming study to assess
their semantic alignment and communicative efficiency with respect to English speakers; and (2)
a cultural transmission experiment of artificial color naming systems (using IICLL) to elicit their
inductive learning biases beyond patterns they may have seen during training.


**Models.** We consider 39 models across 6 model families: Gemini (Google, 2025), Gemma 3
(Gemma-Team et al., 2025), Llama 3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen 2.5 (Qwen et al., 2025), Olmo
2 (OLMo-Team et al., 2025) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). Within each family, we vary models
along several dimensions. Specifically, to gain insight into the properties that may influence the
models’ behavior in our tasks, we consider models with different sizes, instruction-tuned versus
base models, and text-based versus multi-modal models. For Olmo, we also considered its learning
dynamics by analyzing training checkpoints. For a full list of models, see Table 1 in Appendix D.


**Prompts.** In both of our studies, we provided instructions in the prompts to choose only from a
fixed set of terms. The Gemini API supports controlled generation which makes this constrained
classification task straightforward; for all open-weight models, we used log probability based scoring of the allowed terms as a continuation of the prompt. Further details and example prompts can
be found in Appendix J.


**Stimuli.** We used the 330 color chips from the WCS grid shown in Figure 1a. These chips represent a systematic sampling of color space and are standard stimuli in color naming research. Each
chip is associated with precise coordinates in the CIELAB color space, which can be converted to
sRGB coordinates. To present the color stimuli to the text-based LLMs, we encoded color using
these numerical coordinates. For multimodal models, we generated a square colored image corresponding to the WCS chip’s sRGB values, and passed this image together with the text instructions.


**Evaluation.** Following Zaslavsky et al. (2018), we use two main evaluation measures in our studies. First, the _**efficiency**_ _**loss**_ of a semantic system is measured by its minimum deviation from
optimality, defined as _ε_ = min _β{_ _β_ [1] [(] _[F][β]_ [[] _[q]_ []] _[−F]_ _β_ _[∗]_ [)] _[}]_ [where] _[F]_ _β_ _[∗]_ [is] [the] [optimal] [value] [of] _[F][β]_ [in] [Eq.]

1. Second, we measure the _**semantic (mis)alignment**_ between two systems by the Normalized Information Distance (NID) (Kraskov et al., 2005; Vinh et al., 2010). NID is a metric capturing the
distance between two clusterings (in this case, induced by color naming categories), providing a
quantitative measure of structural similarity between the naming systems. Since NID is bounded in

[0 _,_ 1], we take 1 - NID as a measure of similarity, or alignment. _**IB-alignment**_ measures the similarity between a system and the nearest ( _ϵ_ -fitted) optimal IB system. _**WCS-alignment**_ measures the
average alignment between a system and the WCS languages, and _**English-alignment**_ measures the
alignment between a system and English.


4 RESULTS


4.1 ENGLISH COLOR NAMING


We begin with the results from our English color naming study, in which we elicited color naming
responses from LLMs with English color terms and then evaluate their IB-efficiency and alignment
with the actual English color naming system from Lindsey & Brown (2014). As illustrated in Figure 1a, we consider two variants of this task, a text-only variant where colors are presented as sRGB
coordinates, and an image-based variant where colors are presented as a color patch. More details
on our procedure can be found in Appendix B.


The resulting systems are shown in Figure 2b, their IB tradeoffs are shown in Figure 2a, and their
quantitative evaluation is shown in Figure 2c (see also Figures 7, 8 and 9 in Appendix E). We find
that LLMs vary widely in their complexity and English-alignment, with larger instruction-tuned
models achieving better alignment and IB-efficiency. No model aligns perfectly with the English
system from Lindsey & Brown (2014), but Gemini-2.0 and Gemma 3 27B (inst.) approximate it
closely. The fact that so many state-of-the-art pretrained LLMs struggle to recapitulate the English

WCS (see Figure 9 in Appendix E). This suggests that although many LLMs struggle to recover the
same particular distinctions as English speakers, they may still possess human-like color categories.


To better understand how LLMs acquire color categories during training, we analyzed the learning trajectory of Olmo 2 32B (Appendix F). English-alignment only slightly increases during pretraining, and the most substantial improvement occurs in the second, instruction-tuning stage. This

To investigate whether LLMs possess an efficiency bias that extends beyond learning the specific
categories of a language on which they were trained, we turn to our second study, which simulates
cultural transmission in LLMs. To this end, we sought to replicate the ILL color naming experiment of Xu et al. (2013) as closely as possible, using our IICLL paradign shown in Figure 1b (see
Appendix G for more details). We considered only large, instruction tuned models that performed
well in the English color naming task for our IICLL experiments: Gemini 2.0, Gemma 3 27B, Qwen

are higher than the human IL trajectories, and are also higher than a baseline learner based on an alternative feature-based clustering algorithm (Appendix M). This suggests that Gemini truly exhibits
an emergent inductive learning bias toward IB-efficiency, even though as fas as we know it was not
trained or fine-tuned with respect to the IB objective function.

resentations, without being trained for this objective. To do this, we first conducted an in-depth analysis of English color naming across 39 LLMs, and found that a surprising number of state-of-the-art
models fail to capture the English color naming system. However, some of the most recent, larger,
instruction-tuned models achieve high English-alignment and comparable IB tradeoffs. We then
demonstrated that LLMs that do align well with the English color naming system are not merely
mimicking patterns in their training data, but rather exhibit a more fundamental capacity to learn
human-aligned, efficient color category systems. To do this, we introduced Iterated in-Context Language Learning (IICLL) to simulate cultural transmission of category systems. Over generations of
IICLL, LLMs tend to restructure randomly-initialized artificial category systems toward greater IBefficiency and alignment to human naming systems. We also provide initial evidence that LLMs can
develop structured categories over generations of IICLL in a domain distinct from color, suggesting
that our results may apply in other semantic domains as well. Taken together, our findings suggest


9


that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems, guided
by the same IB-efficiency principle that underlies human languages. Importantly, neither humans
nor LLMs are explicitly trained for optimizing the IB objective, suggesting that IB-efficiency may
emerge to support intelligent behavior.


Our empirical results open up several important questions for future research. First, while our work
demonstrates that cultural transmission alone (via IICLL) can be a sufficient pressure for some LLMs
to develop efficient, human-like category systems, a more complete understanding of language evolution requires integrating functional pressure of language use, e.g., via communication. Therefore,
an important future direction is to extend our IICLL framework to incorporate communication as a
selective pressure, for example, by adopting models that explicitly integrate both transmission and
communication (e.g., Kouwenhoven et al., 2024). Second, the precise origins of the bias we observe
in LLMs toward efficiency are unclear (for example, how might this bias emerge from properties
of the training data, instruction-tuning, or model size), and investigating this is another important
direction for future work. Lastly, it is important to extend our analyses across more languages and
semantic domains.

A IB COMMUNICATION MODEL AND THEORETICAL BOUND


**IB communication model** The IB framework is based on a basic communication model that considers an inventory of words _W_ to communicate about a space of meanings, _M_ . The specific model
we apply in this paper is the previously published IB color naming model of Zaslavsky et al. (2018).
In this model, meanings are assumed to be mental representations or beliefs over world states _U_,
formally defined as probability distributions _m_ ( _u_ ) over world states _u_ _∈U_ . In our setting, the
set of world states _U_ is taken to be the 330 color chips from the WCS grid, and meanings over
colors are grounded in the CIELAB perceptual space such that each target color referent, _ut_ _∈U_,
is represented as a Gaussian distribution _mt_ ( _u_ ) centered around _ut_ . Meanings are drawn from an
information source, _p_ ( _m_ ), which characterizes how often each meaning needs to be communicated.
The need distribution over meanings in this model, _p_ ( _m_ ), was estimated using the method of leastinformative priors (see Zaslavsky et al. (2020) for an extensive evaluation of this need distribution).
Note that, in our IICLL experiments, we sample stimulus-word pairs uniformly for training data for
each generation, instead of biased sampling from this prior. This was done in order to replicate the
procedure in Xu et al. (2013).


Given a meaning _m ∼_ _p_ ( _m_ ), a speaker produces a signal _w_ using a stochastic production policy, also
called an encoder, _q_ ( _w|m_ ), and then a listener interprets the signal by reconstructing an estimated
belief state _m_ ˆ _w_ ( _u_ ) = [�] _m_ _[q]_ [(] _[m][|][w]_ [)] _[m]_ [(] _[u]_ [)][.] [Note that this form of listener interpretations corresponds]
to a Bayesian listener. While this form is assumed here for simplicity, it is not an actual assumption
but rather a derivation from the theory (see the SI of Zaslavsky et al. (2018)).


**IB theoretical bound** A semantic category system in this framework corresponds to a stochastic
encoder, _q_ ( _w|m_ ), which maps meanings to signals. An optimal semantic system, according to
the IB principle, is an encoder that satisfies a tradeoff between its informational complexity and
communicative accuracy. Complexity, also known as information rate (Cover & Thomas, 2006), is
defined by the mutual information between speaker meanings and signals,


- _p_ ( _m_ ) _q_ ( _w|m_ ) log _[q]_ [(] _[w][|][m]_ [)]

_q_ ( _w_ )

_m,w_


_Iq_ ( _M_ ; _W_ ) = 


(2)
_q_ ( _w_ ) _[,]_


which captures the number of bits, on average, that is required to encode meanings with signals.
Maintaining low complexity corresponds to using fewer bits for communication, i.e., achieving high
compression rate, which in turn, can be translated to affording a smaller lexicon size. For example,
minimal complexity can be achieved by compressing all possible meanings into a single signal.
This, however, will result in very poor accuracy. Accuracy, in IB terms, is quantified by


                        -                         - ��
_Iq_ ( _W_ ; _U_ ) = _I_ ( _M_ ; _U_ ) _−_ E _q_ _D_ _M_ _∥M_ [ˆ] _,_ (3)


which corresponds to maintaining a language that is informative about the speaker’s intentions.
Maximizing accuracy, as expressed in Eq. 3, amounts to minimizing the expected distortion between
speaker and listener meanings, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence _D_ [ _M_ _∥M_ [ˆ] ]. We say that a
language’s semantic system is _efficient_ to the extent that its encoder _q_ minimizes the IB tradeoff:


_Fβ_ [ _q_ ] = _Iq_ ( _M_ ; _W_ ) _−_ _βIq_ ( _W_ ; _U_ ) s.t _._ _β_ _≥_ 1 _,_ (4)


where _β_ is a free parameter controlling the tradeoff between pressure to minimize complexity and
pressure to maximize accuracy. The solutions to this optimization problem define the IB theoretical
limit of efficiency, which means that no system can lie above this theoretical bound (see Fig. 3).

B ENGLISH COLOR NAMING PROCEDURE


The color naming task was conducted by prompting a model to label a color chip, for all 330 color
chips from the WCS stimulus array, one stimulus at a time, in a randomized order. Unlike the
prompts in our IICLL study, we do not provide the model with access to previous interactions. Each
prompt was of the form: “What color is this [ <color coordinates> ]? You may only use
one of the following allowed labels: [‘Red’, ‘Blue’, _. . ._ ] Please provide only a single label from the
list just provided. Do not give any explanation.” When prompting models with text only, the color
coordinates were sRGB triples. The allowed set of labels were fourteen basic English color terms
corresponding to the modal terms from Lindsey & Brown (2014).


C ENGLISH COLOR NAMING WITH CIELAB INPUTS


To address the generalizability of our findings beyond sRGB inputs, we replicated our English color
naming task using CIELAB triples as the input features for the prompt text. CIELAB is a perceptually uniform space and so provides a principled color space to contrast with sRGB. We restricted
to testing the four models that performed best from our original study (which used sRGB-encoded
stimuli).


Figure 6 illustrates mode maps of the resulting systems for models when prompted with CIELABencoded colors. We found that performance generally degraded across all models when providing
features as CIELAB triples: they struggled significantly to align with established English color
boundaries, and the resulting category systems were considerably noisier compared to the sRGBbased outputs. This outcome is consistent with previous research by Marjieh et al. (2024) which
noted that other frontier models failed to produce coherent English color category systems when
prompted with CIELAB triples. Based on this observation, we restricted our IICLL study to the
sRGB feature space to assess the models’ inductive bias under ideal conditions.

Complexity (bits)


Figure 8: IB complexity-accuracy tradeoffs achieved by instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs. Points
without color filling indicate systems resulting from providing colors as images, rather than via
sRGB coordinates in text. Each minimal pair is connected by a line. Interestingly, there appears to
be a cutoff at around 3 bits of complexity for which models that already perform well with text-based
prompting do not improve alignment to English when prompted with an image instead.


As can be seen in Figure 9, many of the models performed poorly on the English naming task,
with many base (not instruction-tuned) models and some smaller instruction-tuned models failing
to produce naming systems with any coherent category structure. Figure 7 shows that these systems
are distributed widely across the information plane, with only larger, instruction-tuned, very recent
models achieving similar IB-efficiency tradeoffs to English speakers. Interestingly, some models
show similar category structure not to English, but to languages in the WCS. For example, Olmo2-32B-Instruct, and Qwen-2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (when presented with images) bear resemblance to
Mayoruna (see the final row of Figure 13), as well as some of the systems to which Gemini-2.0
converges over generations of IICLL. This suggests that although some larger, instruction tuned


20


21


models and multimodal instruction-tuned models fail to recover the English naming system, they
may still possess some general bias towards color category structure that is aligned with humans.


22


F OLMO TRAINING TRAJECTORY


As model checkpoints are available for the base Olmo 2 32B (OLMo-Team et al., 2025) model
throughout its training, we repeated our English color naming study throughout different stages of
its model training. The training procedure involved two main phases: pre-training on up to 6 trillion
tokens, and a second training stage using a curated dataset of 843 billion tokens, including highquality, academic, and instruction-tuning data. This also involved training on 100 billion and 300
billion token samples and then averaging the final checkpoints in a process called model souping.


Furthermore, we found that hinting to the model that the coordinates were in fact sRGB values
could improve model performance—specifically, when the prompt was changed to “What color
is this rgb=[ <color coordinates> ]?”. To aid in our analysis of the base pretrained Olmo
models, we used this form of prompting in order to see what structure is achievable in principle.


Figure 10 shows that there is a slight increase in scores towards the end of stage 1 training, and a large
jump in performance occurs after just 1000 steps of stage 2 training. This is particularly interesting
given that stage 2 included _pretraining_ on instruction-tuning data, given that we found instructiontuning was strongly associated with higher alignment and complexity across other models.

G ITERATED IN-CONTEXT LANGUAGE LEARNING PROCEDURE


**Procedure** We aimed to replicate the procedure of Xu et al. (2013). The initial training data for the
first generation of IICLL consisted of random pairings of colors and nonsense terms, with a sample
size six times the allowed vocabulary size. For vocabulary sizes ranging from 2 to 6 terms, the initial
training data was sourced directly from Xu et al. (2013) to facilitate direct comparison. A 14-term
condition was also included for comparison with English (Lindsey & Brown, 2014), with its initial
mappings randomly generated as it was not part of the original study.


Next, we performed a sanity check to ensure that the LLM could recover the information from the
training data. This involved presenting each stimulus from the training set to the LLM one at a time,
in a random order and without any history of previous interactions, and verifying that the model
could recover the correct labels as provided in the prompt. With the exception of the most resourceintensive _k_ = 14 condition, all models achieved a stable comprehension accuracy of _∼_ 80% or
greater throughout generations. The _k_ = 14 condition served as an extreme-case sanity check,
resulting in highly unstable performance (based on a failure to retrieve the required 84 examples;
see the final paragraph of this section). Only Gemini occasionally passed this threshold; we elected
to report the _k_ = 14 condition results to illustrate the point of divergence in model capability.


Following this, we began the ‘production phase’, in which we prompted the model to provide a
label for an unseen color stimulus. This was repeated for every item in the WCS stimulus array,
presented in a randomized order, including those stimuli that were part of the initial training set for
that generation. During this production phase, we also monitored the LLM’s consistency with the
labels provided in the initial training set. While perfect adherence was not crucial since deviations
may reflect the models’ inductive biases, we observed that consistency with the training set remained
much higher than chance in the first generations and quickly rose to ceiling.


In addition, to promote response coherence and crudely mimic short-term memory influences found
in human experiments, each subsequent prompt was augmented with a sliding window of the 10
most recent user-model interactions (see Appendix K for details on window size selection and its
impact).


Once labels were obtained for all stimuli in the production phase, this full set of stimulus-label pairs
constituted the current generation’s complete color category system. This marked the completion of
one generation. To initiate the next generation, a new training set was created by randomly sampling
stimulus-word pairs from the just-completed generation’s system, with the sample size being six
times the number of allowed words in the vocabulary. This entire process was repeated for up to 13
generations, (which was the length of chains in Xu et al. (2013)) or until two successive generations
yielded degenerate systems (where all stimuli are mapped to a single term).

J PROMPTING


In both of our studies, we provided instructions in the prompts to choose only from a fixed set of
terms. The Gemini API supports controlled generation which makes this constrained classification
task straightforward. For all open-weight models, we used log probability based scoring of the allowed terms as a continuation of the prompt to implement constrained choice. We used this decoding
approach because after initial exploration of a brute-force method of repeating the prompt up to ten
times until the model generated an output from the allowed set of terms, we found that only Llama
3.3-70B-Instruct could generate usable output (and in this case produced comparable behavior). For
our probability-based decoding, we used the default generation configurations loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library, which include a decoding temperature of 0 _._ 6 and a top ~~p~~ sampling
threshold of 0 _._ 9.

K SLIDING WINDOW CONVERSATION HISTORY


During the production phase of our IICLL experiments, each response from the model was saved
and added to a sliding window of N previous user-model interactions, excluding the initial training
data. After preliminary explorations with window sizes of 0, 10, 20, and 50, we determined that
a window size of 0 led to degenerate category systems more frequently (see Figures 14 and 15),
while the results from a window size of 20 and 50 did not significantly differ from those obtained
with a window size of 10. Consequently, we set the window size to 10 for all IICLL experiments.
This window was included in the prompt for subsequent stimuli, presented after the initial training
data and before each new stimulus, aiming to promote coherence in the model’s responses and to
crudely mimic the influence of short-term memory that human participants would possess in Xu
et al. (2013)’s experiments.

L IICLL WITH SMALLER MODELS


We restricted our main Iterated In-Context Language Learning (IICLL) analysis to models that performed well on the initial English naming task to focus specifically on the evolution towards nontrivial IB-efficiency. This prioritization was based on our expectation that models lacking sufficient
inference power, coherence in color naming, or in-context learning capacity would be unable to
sustain non-trivial category structure under IL pressure.


In order to confirm this empirically for models with weak initial performance, we ran supplementary
IICLL simulations using four models that performed modestly at the English naming task: Gemma 3
4b, Llama 3.2 3B, Qwen 2.5 3B, and OLMo 2 7B (all instruction-tuned). These simulations covered
the five vocabulary-size conditions ( _k_ = 2 through 6) used in the experiments of Xu et al. (2013).


The trajectories of these chains are depicted in Figure 16. Across these 20 chains, only the Gemma
model converged to a two-word system (in the _k_ = 6 condition), while the remaining 19 chains all

M NEAREST NEIGHBOR BASELINE FOR IICLL


To test whether the semantic category systems that emerge from IICLL are merely simple approximations of feature-based clustering, we conducted a set of baseline simulations using a Nearest
Neighbor (NN) classifier in place of an LLM in the IICLL task. In this setup, the NN classifier
predicted the category label for each test stimulus based solely on the sRGB features of the provided
in-context training examples.


We analyzed performance in the most challenging condition ( _k_ = 14 allowed terms). The results, presented in Figure 17, show that while the leading open-weight LLMs achieve significantly
worse alignment compared to the NN baseline, the leading frontier model, Gemini 2.0, performs
significantly better than this baseline on all evaluation metrics (efficiency, IB-alignment, and WCS
alignment). In other words, Gemini’s evolved categories are significantly more human-like and more
IB-like than a simple nearest-neighbor clustering of the input examples.


This result suggests that the ability to acquire a human-like, optimally-compressed semantic representation is (1) not trivial because it is a capability only emergent in the most advanced frontier
model, and (2) it cannot be explained by a simpler nearest-neighbor process that only maintains
contiguous partitions regardless of their efficiency and IB-alignment.

the Nearest Neighbor sRGB baseline classifier (NN-rgb). While many models struggle to achieve
alignment to IB and human languages comparable to that of the Nearest Neighbor classifier, Gemini
achieves greater efficiency (a), alignment with optimal IB systems (b), and alignment with human
languages (c) across IICLL generations. Compare to Figure 4.
