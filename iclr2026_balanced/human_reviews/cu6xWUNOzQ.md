### Summary
The manuscript proposes a nonlinear, multimodal brain-encoding model that fuses features from a speech model (Whisper) and a language model (Llama) to predict voxelwise fMRI during naturalistic listening. Instead of a classic linear mapping, the authors train a compact MLP encoder (after PCA compression) that allows cross-modal interactions, and they report clear gains in prediction accuracy over strong linear baselines and functional-connectivity benchmarks. Beyond accuracy, the nonlinear model yields more coherent cortical organization in data-driven clustering (e.g., somatomotor body-part structure, canonical ventral-visual modules, and dorsal speech pathway alignment), suggesting it captures structured spatiotemporal relationships in brain responses. Overall, the results argue that modest nonlinear fusion of audio and semantic features—without fine-tuning huge foundation models—improves both predictive performance and the interpretability of large-scale cortical organization during speech comprehension.

### Strengths
Timely question and clear advance: Shows that modest nonlinear, multimodal fusion (audio + semantics) can outperform strong linear speech-encoding baselines on naturalistic fMRI.

Scale: Uses a compact MLP  avoiding billion-parameter fine-tuning while still delivering sizeable gains

Captures cross-modal interactions: Architecture can model audio×semantic synergies that linear sums miss; analyses tie improvements specifically to nonlinearity, not just dimensionality reduction.

Cortical organization emerges: Nonlinear encoders yield more coherent, neuroanatomically sensible clusters (somatotopy, ventral visual modules, dorsal speech pathway), adding interpretive value beyond prediction.

### Weaknesses
The clustering improvement is modest. Modularity rises 0.145→0.155 (vs. FC 0.068). Stability/uncertainty metrics (split-half ARI/NMI) would help to strengthen the claim. 

Because frequency and length correlate with both acoustic rate and major axes of semantic embeddings—and explain substantial variance in psycholinguistic RTs—I would recommend variance-partitioning controls in this case.  Encoding approaches like this are powerful, but it is possible that what seems to be semantic encoding instead is the encoding of quasi-semantic features such as frequency, which of course have a strong effect on the brain signal because high frequency words and concepts are easier to process. 

The observation of semantic effects in somatosensory/motor cortices is intriguing, but I would urge caution in linking these results to embodied semantic memory. The semantic effect in motor region can again be largely explained by quasi-semantic features like frequency (more frequent words are easier to simulate acoustically), and have nothing to do with embodied simulation of meaning such as: I listen to the sentence "she grasped the idea in a minute" and I activated the motor neurons involved in grasping. These theories are highly controversial and this paper lacks adequate evidence to support them.  On the other hand, the argument in support to the Motor theory of speech perception is more solid and indeed the acoustic features explain much of the variance in motor regions.

While the clustering and encoding results in higher-order visual cortices are interesting, I would be cautious about interpreting them as support for convergence-zone theory or modality-independent semantic representations. First, it remains unclear which specific semantic features drive these effects. Second, activity in ventral visual areas could plausibly reflect concurrent visual mental imagery during narrative listening (hence modality-specific), or relatively automatic feedback from higher-order semantic regions (e.g., along a concreteness/abstractness dimension). I recommend softening the interpretation (e.g., “consistent with” rather than “support for”) unless additional controls demonstrate that these signals are not explained by imagery or feedback and are truly modality-invariant.

### Questions
Accounting for hemodynamics. Specify/justify the temporal model (FIR/HRF) used within the MLP pipeline and show that results are robust to reasonable choices (e.g., different lag windows), to rule out timing advantages unrelated to feature content.

Stability/uncertainty metrics (split-half ARI/NMI) would help to strengthen the claim of clustering improvement

I don't want to overload the authors with analysis involving precise linguistic of semantic features because this is clearly not the objective of this kind of approach, however, I would at least rule out the effect of frequency, since it is well know to be crucial for comprehension and to modulate brain activity a lot. 

I will tone down or even avoid claims in support of Embodied semantics or Convergence zones unless the authors are able to provide stronger evidence.

### Summary
This work is part of a broader research effort to explore the alignment between representations from language models and human brain activity during speech comprehension. While prior brain encoding studies typically used linear mapping between text- or speech- stimulus features from unimodal models and voxel activations of speech-evoked brain activity, the current work performs nonlinear mapping between stimulus features to predict speech-evoked fMRI brain activity. They also combined text- and speech features, defined as multimodal features, to predict the brain activity. The authors argue that use of nonlinear mapping introduces a complex integration of auditory signals with linguistic features for better brain predictions. Using the nonlinear multimodal approach, the evaluation focuses on comparing brain predictivity with baseline models such as linear regression, multi-layer linear regression, and delayed interaction MLP methods for brain encoding. Furthermore, the authors test nonlinear multimodal models to examine which components are really driving brain activity. Overall, proposed nonlinear MLP shows strong encoding performance (>17% improvement) over linear mapping predictions, suggesting that nonlinear and multimodal approaches are alternative approaches to brain encoding.

**Contributions:**

* *Nonlinear, multimodal brain encoding:* The study uses a nonlinear MLP and multimodal features by concatenating MLP hidden-layer features of text- and speech-based language-model representations, and uses these multimodal features to predict fMRI brain response to speech-evoked activity. Specifically, the authors introduce an MLP on each modality’s features as well as another MLP mapping from the integrated multimodal representation to brain activity, an approach that is less explored relative to linear mappings between stimuli and brain activity.
* *Comprehensive evaluation:* The study evaluates nonlinear, multimodal early-fusion (MLP) and compares the brain predictivity against baseline models including linear regression, multilayer linear regression, Delayed Interaction MLP. For each encoding model, the authors report Pearson correlation and normalized correlation coefficient. Further, they use RED-based (Relative Error Based) clustering methods to examine the role of nonlinearity after dimensionality reduction. Also, the use of variance partition methods explains the contribution of each modality  in nonlinear cross-modal interactions across language, sensory and motor ROIs.

**Technical summary:**
This is primarily an empirical study, and its methodology involves the following components:
* *Linear and nonlinear encoding models:* The authors define several encoding models to map the alignment between language model representations and brain activity. Linear regression follows standard prior brain encoding studies. The nonlinear MLP uses a single hidden layer with a hidden dimension of 256 units. The MLLinear model is an MLP with no dropout, no batch normalization, and no nonlinear activation; they use identity as activation function, meaning everything is linear. The Delayed interactionMLP performs an MLP on each modality first; the reduced modality representations are concatenated and then linearly mapped to brain activity.
* *Normalized correlation coefficient (CCnorm):* To compute CCnorm, the authors estimate a ceiling (CCmax) for each voxel, and model performance divided byCCmax gives CCnorm. 
* *Relative Error Based clustering:* RED quantifies the temporal advantage of one feature set over another. Specifically, the RED method identifies the time points at which semantic features from LLaMA predict better than auditory features from Whisper and vice versa. RED is computed by the signed difference of absolute model errors. 

**Experimental design/evaluation:**
* *Encoding performance of linear and nonlinear encoders:* The authors evaluate the encoding performance of linear model, an MLP with single hidden layer, an MLLinear, and Delayed interaction MLP. To perform encoding, authors use a naturalistic Moth Radio Hour fMRI dataset in which 3 participants listened to 95 stories. To build encoding models, they extract text-modality representations from LLaMA and speech-modality representations from Whisper and report encoding performance in unimodal and multimodal settings (concatenated features used as multimodal for linear and MLLinear).
* *Role of nonlinearity vs. complex, rich representations:* This analysis evaluates whether nonlinearity is the factor that drives better encoding performance or whether complex rich representations drive better predictivity. The authors perform a linear mapping on PCA-reduced dimension and MLLinear (an MLP without nonlinear activation, using full dimension). If both settings result in similar or lower performance, this implies that nonlinearity is a key factor driving better encoding performance. 
* *Role of nonlinearity vs. multimodal integration:* This analysis tests whether nonlinearity improves cross-modal integration in predicting brain activity over within-modality nonlinearity with a linear mapping to brain activity. If nonlinear multimodal integration improves over other settings, it implies that the nonlinear approach provides better cross-modal interaction than linear models.
* *Contribution of each modality in nonlinear, multimodal encoders:* The authors use variance partitioning approach to examine the explainable variance of semantic features (LLaMA) in multimodal integration across language, sensory and motor ROIs. The same analysis is performed to examine the explainable variance of speech features in multimodal integration.


**Main findings:**
According to the authors’ interpretation, the main findings are as follows:
* Across four encoder model settings, nonlinear multimodal encoding achieves higher brain predictivity over linear models.
* The superior encoding performance of nonlinear approaches over linear approaches is examined by disentangling nonlinearity from reduced feature dimensionality, and finding that nonlinearity fundamentally drives superior encoding performance.
* The ROI analysis using modality-specific contributions reveals that adding audio features enhances predictions in auditory, primary motor, somatomotor, and precuneus regions, while adding semantic features enhances predictions across all cortical ROIs except the auditory region, indicating that semantic features show a broad influence on neural activity.
* The variance-partitioning analysis reveals a contribution of auditory information in higher visual areas, suggesting that auditory signals may provide information beyond visual or linguistic features alone.

### Strengths
I found this work to have the following strengths:
* *Clarity:* The manuscript introduction, dataset, and key methodological details are well written and well structured. The encoding model details are easy to follow and clearly present differences in model training for nonlinear and linear approaches. Later, the noise ceiling estimate, and RED metrics are described clearly. The results section clearly reports encoding performance across unimodal and multimodal settings, for all voxels and with PCA on brain data, using four encoding models; further, authors applied the control of modality in multimodal and explain the variance across brain ROIs, and then presents variance partitioning analysis to describe the shared and unique variance of unimodal and joint features of the MLP.
* *Originality:*  The idea of using nonlinear mappings to build encoding models and controlling model parameters similar to the MLLinear setting, is simple yet methodologically novel. Further, the authors perform disentangling of nonlinearity vs. feature dimensionality using linear approaches to predict brain responses and learn subject-specific models. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of using nonlinear approaches in brain encoding, compares them with linear regression, and provides implications for using nonlinear approaches over linear models.
* *Significance:* This work is significant in that it contributes to a better understanding of the contribution of nonlinear approaches for better encoding performance during speech comprehension. The comprehensive analysis on the Moth Radio Hour dataset shows that nonlinear approaches show higher degree of brain predictivity over linear brain encoding. Beyond prediction accuracy, the work contributes a reproducible evaluation and analysis framework that clarifies when nonlinear multimodal encoders help in naturalistic speech brain encoding, especially with lower parameter settings.

### Weaknesses
From my perspective, the primary weaknesses of this study arise from the lack of statistical significance testing, limited  and limited evaluation:
* *Motivation for nonlinear approaches:* The authors argue that “nonlinear approaches are common in computer vision” and they aim to explore this in speech brain encoding (Yang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Scotti et al., 2024)”. However, Yang et al. (2023) use a linear voxel-wise readout on nonlinear deep features; this is standard linear mapping in brain encoding studies, where complex rich representations from non-linear language models are mapped to brain activity with a linear model.  Also, Chen et al., 2023; Scotti et al., 2024 are brain decoding studies that reconstruct visual stimuli from fMRI brain activity; projecting brain voxels into a common embedding space is common in brain decoding, and the objective is different. Given this, authors' motivation to use nonlinear approaches for speech brain encoding is not well  justified by these prior vision studies. I recommend that the authors clarify the motivation with more appropriate prior literature.
* *Interpretability vs. prediction accuracy:* The authors show that nonlinear, multimodal encoding exhibits a higher degree of brain predictivity over linear regression, with 17.2% (unnormalized) and 17.9% (normalized). However, the major question arises with interpretability. The main objective of aligning language models with brain language processing is to understand information processing in the two systems. Since the representations from language models are rich and complex while brain recordings are noisy with low SNR, researchers use simple linear models to map the systems. The use of nonlinear approaches resulting in increased prediction accuracy is not surprising. However, nonlinearity adds complexity and obscures the interpretability objective. Although the authors provide some justification that nonlinearity is the factor driving better performance over feature dimensionality, interpretability requires disentangling features into semantics, syntax, discourse, etc., and examining which regions process this information. Adding nonlinearity to the representations makes things more complex and makes it hard to understand which linguistic properties are really driving the activity. I suggest the authors discuss the motivation of prioritizing prediction accuracy using nonlinear approaches versus interpretability using linear approaches, and clarify the text to make the paper stronger.
* *No statistical significance reports:* The paper reports no statistical significance tests (e.g., block permutation and each model predictions and FDR correction across model groups) to determine significant voxels. Without any significance tests, the performance of MLP over other models should be considered as descriptive rather strong empirical evidence.
* *No standard error or standard deviation across subjects:* The results reported in Table 1 state that average voxelwise r^2 and normalized correlation coefficient (CCnorm) are reported for all models, without accompanying measures of variability such as standard deviation or standard error. These metrics are critical for evaluating the robustness of the findings. 
* *Nonlinearity vs. dimensionality reduction:* Section 3.1 concludes that “nonlinearity that fundamentally drives superior encoding performance”, because MLP outperforms linear (PCA) and MLLinear(no activation function). Since MLP(PCA) and MLLinear have parameter match, the performance improvement is marginal. Without any statistical significance tests on the differences between models, the claim is not conclusive. 
* *Lack of modality control and interpretation:* Authors use RED metric (signed difference of absolute errors) to compare multimodal vs. unimodal predictors and to examine the “impact” of semantic (text) vs. audio features. However, RED is a comparative error metric, not a control procedure: it does not remove shared/collinear information between modalities, nor does it quantify unique vs. shared variance. As a result, subtracting one model’s error from another’s does not establish which modality is causally responsible for a prediction improvement.


For a complete and detailed account of both major and minor issues, please refer to the “Questions” section.

### Questions
I would like to thank the authors for the interesting comparison between nonlinear and linear approaches for fMRI brain encoding during speech comprehension. However, there are several points that I believe require further attention/work. I have divided these into major issues, which should be prioritized, and minor ones, which should be addressed for a strong version of current work.

**Major Comments/Questions:**
* *Motivation and positioning:* As discussed in weakness1, I request authors to clarify why nonlinearity should help in speech brain encoding? Also, please correct Line 56: nonlinear approaches are more popular in brain decoding; this should not be presented as direct motivation for encoding.
* *Interpretability vs. prediction accuracy:* I recommend authors to provide a discussion on the trade-off between interpretability (linear mapping) and prediction accuracy (nonlinear approaches) for the paper's main objective.
* *Statistical significance and clarity on Table 1:* I suggest authors following
Please perform blocked permutation tests with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction (across voxels), report the adjusted p-values and effect sizes on model groups, and clearly indicate which model pairs are statistically significant.
Select voxels which are significant for each model and report prediction performance between models.
* *Reporting variability:*  Please report standard deviations (or standard errors) alongside mean values to provide a clearer picture of variability in Table 1. 
* *Lack of modality control:* Prior studies use methods like residual approach to control one feature over other by regressing linearly correlated information [Toneva et al. 2022, Oota et al. 2024]. The other approach is to fit Text-only, Audio-only, and Text+Audio models with the same approach; report joint − best unimodal with paired bootstrap testing across voxels/subjects, and correct voxelwise tests with FDR [Reddy et al. 2021, Oota et al. 2023]. I recommend authors perform any of these methods to perform modality controlled contribution. To further validate this, authors can test any simple downstream task evaluation to see the impact of these controlled modality features.

Oota et al. 2023, How does brain process syntax structure during listening, ACL Findings 2023

Reddy et al. 2021, Can fMRI the representation of syntactic structure in the brain, NeurIPS 2021


* *Clarity on multimodal integration vs. fusion vs. multimodal model:* The authors state that (i) MLP on text, (ii) MLP on audio, and (iii) concatenated these features considered as cross-model integration. Concatenation performed before is multimodal fusion. The paper should clearly define these terms and avoid confusion with multimodal models . In addition, please position multimodal setup against recent multimodal text+speech models (e.g., CLAP, Pengi, AudioLM) that learn paired text+audio embeddings via explicit joint objectives or cross-attention; explain how the concatenation+MLP in paper differs and why it is preferable for this study.
* *Clarity on section 3.3.1:* Section 3.3.1 reports that adding audio features enhance activity in other brain regions as well such as primary motor, somatosensory, occipital, and precuneus, while adding semantic information excel in the whole cortex except auditory cortex. Do these claims align with any prior literature? Oota et al. (2024) report that predictions of speech models (e.g., Whisper) in language regions are due to low-level features. Similarly, text-based language models significantly predict the auditory cortex, and this is due to low-level features. Should the authors clarify whether adding nonlinearity to these model representations yields higher brain-relevant semantics? Is the language component’s contribution in the multimodal features due to the MLP itself?
* *Clarity on Linear (all voxels) vs. MLP (PCA):* I recommend that the authors perform PCA on the weight matrix learned during the linear approach with all voxels and compute the similarity with the MLP model weights in the same PCA dimension. This analysis would provide how similar the encoding models are between the two approaches. The authors can extend this comparison across all four models to see which voxels cluster together in the projection.

**Minor Comments/Typos:**
While addressing the following points may not be critical to the paper’s core contributions, doing so would enhance the overall quality. 
* Please clarify whether the semantic and auditory “controls” shown in Fig. 2 are derived from the RED method. In the text, explicitly describe how each control is constructed and applied.
* What statistical test was used to report significant differences across ROIs in Fig. 2e? How were multiple comparisons handled (e.g., FDR)? Please report the test details and effect sizes.
* Line 476: (Yang et al., 2023) -> Yang et al., (2023)
* Line 75: Appendix section number is missing.
* Line 108: Authors extracted semantic features representations from three LLaMA models. What model results are reported in Table 1?
* Did authors multikernel banded ridge approach? Banded ridge approach works on multiple embedding sources yielding contribution of each feature space in predicting brain activity.

**General Advice:**
The manuscript presents a nonlinear multimodal approach that integrates text and speech features to perform speech brain encoding during speech comprehension. Using a nonlinear approach, the authors evaluate subject-specific models, and compare with linear approaches under different settings. However, the current version lacks a clear motivation for nonlinear approaches, lacks modality control, and reports results without any statistical significance testing. Tables should include subject-level variability and statistical significance tests with FDR correction across models. Addressing these points and the above mentioned weaknesses and major comments would make the work stronger.

### Summary
Instead of classical linearized unimodal speech models to predict voxel-wise cortical activity, the present paper propose a nonlinear multimodal prediction model, integrating audio and semantic features. The paper describes characteristics of the model and reports several elements of evaluation and comparison with other models. In short and in average, the gains are approximately of 15%. The paper also analyzes the results and shows that improvements are mainly due to the nonlinear aspects. Interestingly enough, the analyses also suggest strong relations with a series of neurolinguistic theories (including motor theory of speech perception, the convergence-divergence zone and embodied semantics).

### Strengths
Very interesting paper with an impressive amount of experimental work. The descriptions are very pedagogical and the paper does not remain at the experimental level only, but also develop more theorical interpretations.

### Weaknesses
A related aspect could be developed more, concerning the spatial and temporal complexity of the approach. It is important to have higher performances, but at which cost (in time and energy).

### Questions
Even if the model becomes very large, could it be possible to think even larger, by integrating other modalities, either directly related to linguistic aspects or even wider to other perceptive (eg visual) dimensions ? Or are we here at a limit ?
